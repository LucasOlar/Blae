S-Sorry about that! Whew… If I put that much fear into them they probably wont be back Ill bring you some fresh flowers tomorrow Thank you for getting rid of them Now I should be able to rest in peace Youre welcome Its about time you passed over Im Ichigo Kurosaki, 15, a tenth grader My family runs a medical clinic We save some, and we lose some Maybe its because of that, but ever since I can remember, Ive been able to see ghosts Im home… Youre late! You delinquent! You know that dinnertime here is always at 7:00! You! Is this any way to treat your son, who just laid his life on the line to help a ghost pass over! Shut up! I dont care what your excuse is Anyone who disturbs the peace and happiness in this home will be punished! Or what Are you gloating over the fact that only you can touch or talk to ghosts! Shut up! I didnt ask to be born like this! Stop it, will you two Dinners getting cold Leave them alone, Yuzu More rice please But, Karin… Anyway… Ordering a healthy male high school student to come home every night at 7:00 is… Ichigo, you have a new one on you Huh… This guy…when did he get here! No matter how hard I try to get rid of them, they just wont go away! Thanks for dinner Poor Ichigo… Hes so popular But I sort of envy him I can sense their presence, but I rarely see anything Well, I dont believe in ghosts and such What But you see them too, dont you, Karin Dads the only one who cant see them Whether I see them or not, if I dont believe in them, they dont exist Ohh… So cold! Dinner… Wide open! Never mind! Im going to bed Oh, Ichigo… Its your fault, Dad Why! Ichigo is having a tough time right now Now that you mention it, he said hes seeing more of them than before What! You mean he talks to you about things like that He doesnt tell me… Of course not Youre over 40, but can only communicate in this immature way Whod want to tell you anything Dear… I dont know if its because theyre in puberty, but our daughters have been so cold towards me! What should I do… First of all, get rid of that stupid memorial poster The incident occurred one block away from the main street outside of Karakura Station According to local residents, at about 7:30 AM, the ground shook with a loud crash and the walls of many buildings exploded Good morning, Ichigo Morning… Wheres Dad He has a meeting He wont be home tonight I see… Huh Investigators and explosives experts are currently working to discover the cause Whats wrong Thats near here Hey…! Hm What was that sound I didnt hear anything… Its another explosion! W-Whats that… Help me! Run! What is it! I dont know! Oh Hey! Hurry! H-Hey… Hey, you… What was that, anyway Another explosion Whats going on I cant figure it out… Who was that Who…are you… Who are you! What do you want Hey! Its near… What are you talking about! First you scare the living daylights out of me, then you ignore me Im asking you who you are! Y-You… You can see me But wait…you just kicked me Huh What are you babbling about Of course, I can see you You were the one in town earlier, werent you You just noticed Strange… People usually cant see me… Quit talking nonsense… Why, you…! Then, I will tell you I am…a Soul Reaper Again… Where… I see So youre a Soul Reaper And youve come all the way here from this Soul Society place in order to exorcise evil demons So that means that that monster was a demon… and it attacked that girl Okay, Ill believe you… Idiot! You think Id believe that! YoureYoure saying that, although you see ghosts, you dont believe in Soul Reapers Of course! Unfortunately, Ive never seen a Soul Reaper before I dont believe in anything that I cant see But youre seeing me now Ill admit that youre no human But quit playing Soul Reaper around here Got that You pipsqueak You dare to call me that! Bakudo Number One: Sai! Ouch! What did you do to me! You cant move, can you This is Kido, a high-level incantation that only a Soul Reaper can use I may not look it, but I have lived nearly ten times longer than you And you called me a pipsqueak! In any other situation, I would kill you on the spot, but I am not permitted to execute anyone not named in my orders Be grateful for that, pipsqueak Of all the nerve…! And so… Oh… Y-Youre the guy from yesterday… N-No… I dont want to go to the Netherworld! Fear not Your destination is not the Netherworld It is the Soul Society Unlike the Netherworld, it is a restful place What happened…to that guy I sent him to the Soul Society In your language its called passing over, I guess Its one of the jobs of Soul Reapers I will explain it simply so that even an impatient brat like you can be satisfied Now listen… There are two types of spirits in this world The first are normal spirits called Wholes… Theyre the ghosts you usually see The second are called Hollows They attack people, living or dead, to devour their souls They are evil spirits Do you have any questions so far Well…Tell me why your drawing is so bad, why dont you Hey! What the hell did you do! I will continue my explanation, Baron Baron… We Soul Reapers have two jobs The first is to lead the Wholes to the Soul Society with a sendoff, Konso, as I just did And the second is to cut and purify the Hollows Why was that Hollow going after that girl That I do not know We have yet to grasp everything about them I smell it… Its the smell of an especially tasty soul Its nearby… along with the smell of a Soul Reaper Oh! What was that! Whatever the case, theres another one wandering around here Then, hurry up and get rid of it! No, well… For some reason, I havent been able to sense its presence at all Its as though some strong force is obstructing my senses What are you saying! Cant you hear the terrible cries! Isnt that the Hollow youre after Terrible cries… I dont… I heard that! That is definitely the cry of a Hollow! See! Yuzu! Hey, wait! What strong spirit pressure! How could I not have sensed this! I…! Ichi…go… Yuzu! Karin was… Ichigo… Please save…Karin… Hey, you! Hey! Damn it! Stop it! Stop…it! Stay back! Karin…! Damn it…! Hes moving… after I put that spell on him…! Youll get in the way! Stay back! Shut up! Karin! Stop that! No human strength can break it If you try to force it, your soul will… A human breaking the spell under his own power Wait! Ichigo…! Run! Karin! I found you Karin! Hey! Get a hold of yourself! That Hollow has not devoured your sisters souls yet Are you sure Yes… It is seeking a soul with a higher concentration of spirit energy I see That Hollow this afternoon wasnt after that girl, either What do you mean For some reason, your spirit energy was almost completely suppressed until just now Thats why I didnt sense anything about you, and you were never attacked by a Hollow Its just conjecture, but perhaps the spirit energy that was sealed up within your body… began to pour out due to the contact you had with the ghost of that young girl In other words, those two Hollows sensed the density of your soul through that girl They are really after you! Theyre…after me… Its here! You stay… Shut up! Are you saying that girl was attacked because of me What are you talking about Its my fault that Karin and Yuzus lives are in danger! Please save… Ichigo… Run! Hey! You…! You want my soul, dont you In that case, come fight me one on one! Soul Reaper! You fool! You should have known… that you were no match for him…! Or, did you think that everything would be over if you gave him your soul At this rate, we will all simply become food for him Do you want…to save your family Of course! Is there a way Theres just one way… You must become a Soul Reaper! What! Run the point of this Zanpakuto through the center of your being and I will pour my powers into you I dont know if it will work, but there is nothing else we can do Give me that sword, Soul Reaper My name is not Soul Reaper I am Rukia Kuchiki I am… Ichigo Kurosaki! How could it be… I meant to give him half of my energy, but he took it all… Hey…! Who is he! I have never seen a human with spirit energy enough… to confuse a Soul Reaper I have never seen a human with strength enough to break a spell on his own… And…Ive never seen a Soul Reapers Zanpakuto… become so large! Now youll pay for hurting my family! You fish-face! Though the voyage must continue on May seas always be calm When the cycle of the moon has renewed may it shine Its light to guide your boat I offer this voyage a prayer With each new day that still awaits On vividly shining seas To the end of the journey Hey, how are you all doing This is your idol Kon, who was voted the one youd most want to make your bride in the world of Bleach! Its finally started… The high school Soul Reapers sweet but painful, slightly salty, heartfelt… No! You dont appear until later in the story! Oh, were out of time…"

Thats because my family was being attacked But Im not about to fight for complete strangers Sorry to disappoint you I see Then it cant be helped Hey! Huh Aghh! My body Whatd you do to me! Follow me Hey, where are we going Its around here What is An order from the Soul Society A Whole spirit who lives in this park will probably be attacked Help! Wait! What! Why are you going to help him Isnt he a complete stranger So what I cant just stand here when hes being attacked before my very eyes! Dont be so naive! Wha--! A Soul Reaper must treat all spirits equally Just because theyre close by just because its convenient it doesnt work like that Do not help him! If you intend to help that boy, make up your mind to save all spirits! You must make the commitment to go anywhere and even be willing to sacrifice your life! Are you committed to this, Ichigo No! Who cares about commitment! I saved this boy because I wanted to! What about you What You risked your life to save me last night Did you think about your duty as a Soul Reaper when you acted When you put yourself at risk, it doesnt matter! At the very least I will be different! You okay Hey kid If you dont want another scary experience like that, hurry up and pass over That was a fine Konso Im leaving! Huh! What are you doing! Stop!

Cripes! Shed better be careful That girl Huh You mean, Inoue Are you good friends Not really Ive never even spoken to her much Shes close to one of my friends who lives in the neighborhood Just Just Three years ago her brother died at our hospital What He was her only family It was a car accident Brother! Brother! Dont die! Please dont leave me alone! I didnt know that she was the girl who was crying that day I just found out recently How was your spirit energy at that time Huh Not as strong as it is now Its only recently that Ive been able to see ghosts and talk to them Just as I thought What is it anyway Nothing See you Huh Hey! Wherere you going Home Where to Are you interested Not really Then dont ask W-Why that! Yes! Oh Tatsuki! Mom asked me to give this to you Its stewed beef with potatoes Oh! Wow! Home-made stewed beef and potatoes! This is so delicious! You eat such weird stuff when youre alone You think so Absolutely I mean, what is this stuff Hey Brother Have you seen my pajamas Hey, at least knock! Boy, youve gotten so mean now that youre in high school! Have not And I dont know where your pajamas are Thats weird My dress is also missing But why do you have to ask me about everything!

Aim for the head! Ichigo! Idiot! Dont just swing the sword around! Shut up! As long as I kill it, right! Youre mine! Not deep enough! Huh! What--! It got away Were going after it Whats the matter, Ichigo I have a question What is it That things face It was Inoues brother What! Ill tell you one thing Attacking a Hollow from behind and splitting its head in one blow That is the essence of exterminating a Hollow Do not forget What do you mean This is to minimize your own injuries and also so that you never see the identity of the Hollow What do you mean identity of the Hollow You saw it, just now All Hollows were once the souls of ordinary humans What! You never told me that! Wasnt that just some monster! Some monster we needed to kill! Yes, now he is just a monster And he must be destroyed But he was once human Grudges, regrets Souls who still harbor such feelings are hard to perform Konso on, and linger on alone Then they either become Hollows themselves, or are devoured by other Hollows, and become new Hollows Thats! What You mean, Ichigo! Yes But they were just walking together Whats the matter Why that Ichigo! I didnt realize he was such a fast worker! I mean He didnt even walk you home even though you were hurt! No, he offered to walk me home But Aghh! Watch out! Im going to win! I mean, Champ! What are you imagining To the right! Yes, here! Watch out! Its a gun! What was that Though the voyage must continue on May seas always be calm When the cycle of the moon has renewed may it shine Its light to guide your boat I offer this voyage a prayer With each new day that still awaits On vividly shining seas To the end of the journey I am the charismatic seer of the new century!

Not deep enough! That things face… It was Inoues brother But why would Inoues brother come after me… I dont know But judging from the Hollow that attacked you last time, it seems a powerful Hollow who remains in the dark wants to devour your spiritual power And it probably controls several Hollows Then Inoues brothers appearance would make sense No way! So, what should I do! I cant kill Inoues brother! Think! If you dont kill him, he will wander around forever! And theres no doubt that he will attack you again Wait, we may not have time to worry about him! What do you mean That girl is in danger! Wasnt that delicious Yeah How about some dessert now I have some leeks and bean jam jelly What They go great together Im not too keen for that Huh What was that Oh…poor Enraku! This is terrible How come youre all torn up Whats that! The Hollows target their own kin! It happens frequently What do you mean Hollows are fallen souls Souls that were not guided into the Soul Society by a Soul Reaper Souls that were not protected by Hollows They lose their hearts and become Hollows themselves Now that this Hollow has failed to devour you, he will go after the soul of the one he loved most in his life Remember the bruise on Inoues leg today That was the mark left by a Hollow Then that accident was Inoues brothers doing Perhaps What is this O-Orihime! What is this! How come theres blood! W-What is that! W-What is that Whats happening What is that ghostly thing Is that… me Why What is this chain I cant breathe… Tatsuki! What am I doing here in a daze! Take that! Tatsuki! Tatsuki! Stay away! Tatsuki! Whats wrong Tatsuki! Its useless, Orihime She cant hear us, let alone see us Tatsuki! How…How do you know my name How sad, Orihime… Have you forgotten my voice Its me…cant you tell Stay away! How sad… Im so sad! So sad! Arent I the one youre after! Dammit! Tatsuki, you got caught up in this Kurosaki It IS you! But why Inoue… Say, how come you can see me Huh… Well… Soul Reapers are spiritual beings Only other spiritual beings can see you Its impossible for ordinary people to see you Spiritual being… Thats right In other words, shes a spirit Orihime is dead! Dammit! Dont move! Ichigo! Hey, Ichigo! Hang on, Ichigo! Ichigo! Ichigo! Kurosaki! Let go! Let go! Kurosaki is hurt! Let go! Orihime… Have you forgotten me Brother… Ichigo! Wake up, Ichigo! Will you shut up! Is that any way to talk Where were you hit Forget it Im okay Really Good Dont forget He may have been Inoues older brother, but hes a monster He doesnt have a human heart Kill him without fail Are you really my brother Yes, I am, Orihime Youre lying My brother would never do what youre doing I was lonely Huh You were forgetting about me…little by little After I died, you prayed for me every day I watched you… It was your prayers that gave me peace But after about a year, you became friends with that girl After that… you began praying for me less and less often And when you entered high school, you stopped praying for me altogether Thats why…I was so lonely… Brother, youre wrong…! Listen, Orihime! If you have even a shred of feeling left for me, do not betray me anymore! Just listen to what I tell you It wont take long Ill devour that Soul Reaper and end this quickly! Wait! Kurosaki has nothing to do with this! Please stop, Brother! Dont hurt him anymore! Be quiet! Whose fault do you think it is that I became this way! Its your fault! You will listen to what I say! Otherwise… Ill kill you first! Stop! Listen, you… Do you know why big brothers are born first Its to protect the little brothers and sisters that follow Ichigo! Yet youre threatening to kill your own sister Dont say that, even if you are dead! Shut up! Orihime is mine! I raised her when our parents abandoned us! It was when Orihime was three… Ive protected her ever since! Orihime! Come to me! If you listen to me, I wont lay a hand on the others Wait, its a trap! He no longer has the feelings of a brother But… Entrance Ceremony Brother! Brother! Whats happening! Orihime is…mine! As if! Inoue is Inoue! She doesnt belong…to anyone! Why are you hesitating! Finish him! Inoue… Ori…hime… Im sorry, Brother Its my fault Its all because I begged you not to leave me alone Brother! Please dont die! Please dont leave me alone! Thats why you couldnt…rest in peace Orihime… I sensed that you were always beside me Even yesterday, when that car almost hit me… You protected me, right You pulled my leg to get me out of the way So thats why But if I keep depending on you, youll never be able to rest So I wanted to show you… Im happy You dont have to worry about me But that made you lonely…and sad… Thats not it! Whats going on Hes fighting the Hollow inside him He didnt become a Hollow by choice He probably was taken over by a Hollow… Why Dont you get it His target was supposed to be you A soul that is devoured by a strong Hollow is manipulated by that Hollow In other words, a Hollow who is after you took over a soul whom you would hesitate to fight, and forced him to attack Right now, he is desperately fighting that Hollow For his sisters sake… Orihime! Ori… Inoue! Stay calm! The chain attached to her chest, the Chain of Fate, is still connected As long as it is connected, she will not die I need to treat her Get back I can use my Kido to save her You gave that to her as a present, didnt you Inoue said so… Thats why she wears it every day Hey! Even if I stay here like this, eventually Ill revert to being a monster So now…while I still have a semblance of sanity… I want to disappear Hey! Hey wait…! Ichigo! Hes making the right decision Once you become a Hollow, you can never go back to what you were Let him pass on Rukia! Its all right Reaping a Hollow is not really killing it Youre cleansing its soul and allowing it to enter the Soul Society That is why we Soul Reapers exist Wait, Brother… This hairpin that you bought me that day… We had a fight over it, remember Because I said it was too childish I let you go to work without saying anything… That was the last time  I would see you alive So, I want to say it now… Brother, have a nice day Yeah, Im off now Its true! A sumo champion really came to my room… and blasted a hole with a gun! Huh Not again! Cant you make it sound more realistic At least, say a pro wrestler came and caused a brawl outside Well, I like Himes silly imagination Im saying its true! Right, Tatsuki Uh…yeah Huh Tatsuki, dont tell me you agree So is that what you did yesterday Yes Kurosaki, what is this… Inoue! Hey, whatre you doing! Memory Replacement I erased her memories of tonight and replaced them with new ones Memory Replacement But I cant choose the new memories, which can be a problem In any case, well find out tomorrow You used it on my family the other day, didnt you Yes, I did What is it I dont have the resolve to do this yet Im not such a fine human being that I can promise to risk my life for a stranger However… Im not a total slime whod watch someone get hurt before my eyes Ill help you… do the work of a Soul Reaper Thanks, Im counting on you Though the voyage must continue on May seas always be calm When the cycle of the moon has renewed may it shine Its light to guide your boat I offer this voyage a prayer With each new day that still awaits On vividly shining seas To the end of the journey Brother, thank you for watching over me all this time Ill do my best to find happiness So…Brother, take care Inoue…This is supposed to be the preview… Aw no, were out of time again!"

As I thought, my Kido hasnt recovered enough to use a spell of that level How many years has it been… since I last saw Karin cry… Until our mom died, Karin was a crybaby, just like Yuzu After she died, Yuzu, who was the clever and responsible one, tried to fill in for our mom, and began to take over the housekeeping Karin, who wasnt good at much of anything, stopped crying altogether so as not to worry the rest of us Even when she lost a fight with an upperclassman, or when she hit a ball through the window of the principals office and was reprimanded, or when she broke her leg while hiking, she never cried once Karin…leave this to me Are you really a Soul Reaper Why dont you take off that human form Huh!! Oh…did I…get him Huh… He hit a Hollow… Can he see spirits… No…maybe not… Whats this… he just happened to hit me… I thought he could see me- There… I got im… I-Impossible… He shouldnt be seeing the Hollow, much less hearing his voice… Hes calmly facing down an enemy he cannot even sense… Doesnt he have any fear… Damn… Bet you cant touch me here!

Looks like the shoes on the other foot You Soul Reapers take us too lightly Thats why you end up like this Now…who shall I start eating… I think Ill save the guy for last What…! T-This is crazy!

In the sky! I have an idea! Transfer student… Will this really work Yes Well utilize your strength and my brains What can I say… This dont seem smart at all I dont have to take that from you! Lets go! In the direction of the tiger! Which way is the tiger Humph! Left! Left… You fool! Thats too high! Okay, here we go If Im this far up in the air, no electric pole will reach me Fire!! Give up! O-Okay…! I-I give up…! Just kidding! W-What happened S-Sorry about that He caught me by surprise Damn…! What in the world are these… leeches! Exactly! They wont come off easily… Besides, theyre my targets! Transfer student…! W-What happened Are you surprised! Those leeches are small bombs They respond to sounds from my tongue, and explode! Your guard was wide open You wanna take me on, you lummox But you… Oh! I get it… He ran off a while ago to gain some time to bring this here…! Im sorry, Mister… He caught me… Shibata… Looks like you understand now, big boy Now, its time for us to play, Soul Reaper! Now run! Let me enjoy hunting you down! Dont move from here, Chad… If you take even a step, he plans to blow up that birdcage Transfer student, what about you You neednt worry about me! I gave my word… not to foul up! Your word This is getting fun…! Youre covered with them! How nice…to see you covered in blood Youre so pretty…! I can hardly…wait! Come on, come on, come on, come on! How long do you intend to keep running You can turn around and attack me, if you like! Well! Soul Reaper! Huh What is it… Have you given up already Thats no fun Come on, run, will you I havent given up… I have no need to run anymore What… You said that I could attack you, didnt you In that case, I will take you at your word In that case, I will take you at your word Right…Ichigo… What do you mean, Right, Ichigo Didnt you promise to not worry me by fouling up Fool! Thats a line for someone whos even a little bit worried, to say I guess youre right Damn you…! How long do you intend to sit on my head!! Ichigo Kurosaki, 15 years old! Currently a surrogate Soul Reaper! If you want to chase someone, arent you running after the wrong person Surrogate Soul Reaper… Damn! If thats so…I should have… gone after you from the start! Ichigo! You slowpoke! You look the tastiest… I see So you used those bombs to pin Chad down so you could enjoy attacking a girl Youre nothing but a stinking pig!! But now youre gonna be eaten by that stinking pig I-Ichigo! Whats wrong, Ichigo Chad! Perfect timing Go and hide him and the parakeet somewhere safe Transfer student… What is this… Dont worry Hes now… in the middle of a battle! Good move But remember, the leeches, that flowed out of their bodies… are also bombs! Theres something I want to ask you Are you the one who killed the parents… of the kid inside the parakeet What He said its all my fault Because of me, the man and the girl got hurt Shibata… Its all because I wanted to bring my mom back to life Im sorry… I want my mom to come back to life But Wait! Did someone tell you… that he would bring your mother back to life Did someone tell you there was a way to do that Thats right Im the one who killed that kids mother – while I was still alive At the time, I was a serial killer It was all over TV – I was famous That kids mother was my last victim It was so much fun… She ran as hard as she could She barely had any breath left, but she still tried to protect her kid It was such a thrill But thats where it went wrong I chased her out onto her veranda… That kid! He grabbed my shoe laces… Who woulda thought Id get killed by a slip up like that… I decided to pay that kid back I put the soul of the boy, who survived, into the parakeet, and I told him this: Three months! If you can run around in that form for that long, I would bring his mother back to life Bring her back to life… Fool! Of course, I couldnt do that – bring a dead person back to life! But that kid believed me He ran as hard as he could Whats fun about this penalty game is that I could kill off any and everyone who tried to protect the kid And each time, the kid would whine and beg to quit He didnt like it, he said Thats when I used my clincher… Your mother is waiting for  you to save her! Hearing that, he would always regain his will Hed cry, Mom…! Mom…! What are you sympathizing with him for! You dropped your guard! This is the end for you!! You can have this bomb back Whats wrong Youre going to set it off, arent you Come on and click your tongue! Arent you going to click your tongue In that case… Ill take your tongue! Ah, my tongue! Get lost…! Wha! It is Hell… The Zanpaku-to can only wash away sins committed after death For Hollows that committed major sins before their death… the Gates of the Netherworld will open! So…hes gone to hell… Well… Its unfortunate, but… his chain of fate has been severed; theres no sign of it Theres no way I can return him to his body No… Shibata… Dont worry! Soul Society isnt a scary place! Youll never get hungry, and your body will feel light Youll probably find it a better place than this! Oh… You can say that… when youre just a hanger-on… But, that might be true At least, if you go over, youll be able to see your mom Oh! You cant bring her back to life, but now, you can go to her Ichigo… Mister… Thank you for everything… You ran around with me in your arms, so I didnt get hurt at all… Yes… Youre safe… Well, Ill be going, then Thank you very much Yuichi… When I die and pass over would it be okay if I carried you and ran around again Yes! Now, then… Shall we get on with the Konso Thank you…Ichigo… Though the voyage must continue on May seas always be calm When the cycle of the moon has renewed may it shine Its light to guide your boat I offer this voyage a prayer With each new day that still awaits On vividly shining seas To the end of the journey Pardon me for the last time Im Kisuke Urahara, owner of the Urahara Store Im going to do my best to bring you the preview this time The Urahara Store got its start when I… What are you talking about!

What books do you read anyway! After I built up my image so carefully! He was building up his image You called him a Mod Soul, right Just what is that Once, a project called Spearhead was begun in the Soul Society Spearhead Yes A soul that had been modified for combat was placed into a person who had died and whose soul had left its body They were to be used to fight Hollows It was a despicable plan Mod Soul These souls that were transformed for this project… once  placed into a body, they could make one part of the body super-human… An Artificial Soul made for fighting That is a Kaizo Konpaku, Mod Soul Do you understand so far Yeah That drawing of yours erased all the tension, though But the Spearhead Project was cancelled because it would force corpses to fight Furthermore, all the Kaizo Konpaku, Mod or Modified Souls that were in the development stage were ordered destroyed… but to think, some are still around Does that mean… that guy was created by the Soul Society… and rejected at the whim of the Soul Society! Exactly that And you accept that! Its not a matter of accepting or not Mod Souls must be destroyed Thats the order of the Soul Society Do not forget The laws of the Soul Society are made  for the purpose of protecting human souls! Now lets go! You want to get your body back, dont you! I wonder how he feels in my body They were created thoughtlessly and condemned thoughtlessly… But he survived somehow and found a body… Yet he has to keep running I wonder what hes feeling Yay!

Dont give up! Dad is on your side! See Ignore him, Yuzu! If you pay attention to guys like him, it will only encourage him How naïve Even if you ignore me, Im automatically encouraged! Run! My deathblow: Fathers Slide! Begone…to the ends of the earth! Nows our chance Lets go Boy, its only June, but it sure is hot today It was June 17 that day too, but what a difference Oh, someone else is here Youre right I wonder if shes here to visit a grave too Huh But… shes waving Ichigo, do you know her No! I dont know her! Not at all! If I say I dont know her, I dont! Theres something familiar about her… I remember now! Shes a classmate from middle school! Its all coming back to me! Oh, boy! I feel so nostalgic I think I want to talk to her all alone, right now! And so, Ill go and have a talk with her You two go ahead and visit Moms grave! Ichigo! What Karin, what do you mean by that Well, I think the time for you to let go of your brother is close at hand Huh What do you mean Karin, wait a minute! Why the heck did you follow me here Idiot! What if a Hollow appears when Im not around Thats no reason to… I mean… If youre gonna follow me, be more discreet! Well, pardon me… I didnt think of it What are you mad about Im not really mad… Killed Thats what you said about your mother, right I didnt say that Who killed her I never said that Forget it You said youve been able to see spirits ever since you can remember, didnt you Then, answer one question The one who killed your mother… Wasnt it a Hollow There is that possibility If your spiritual capabilities were such that you were able to see souls since you were so little, the Hollow that came after you may have killed your mother by mistake–! I cant take this anymore! Youve got to be kidding As far as youre concerned, Hollows are responsible for everything There was never anything funny about it, but when you give that as a reason for it there isnt anything thats less funny! Sorry to disappoint you, but youre way off base It wasnt a Hollow or anything The one who killed my mom… was me Hey, Ichigo! Huh When Ichigo was little Why do you ask, out of the blue Did something happen Yes, well actually… I might have found out about his secret His secret Yeah Ichigo might really be a hero protecting the earth! A h-hero, is he… I think I was around four when I first met that hero He came to my dojo with hair an unbelievable color, holding the hand of an unbelievably beautiful mother, and with this unbelievably goofy grin on his face He was skinny and wimpy and looked so weak He really was a weakling… Speaking of which, I was the first one to make him cry I just poked him once, as a joke It didnt even take ten seconds But even if he had been crying, as soon as he saw his mother who came to pick him up hed immediately break out into a smile I hated that about him A boy shouldnt be so happy when hes lost Thats what I thought, looking at his smiling face He was such a wimpy mamas boy… but he seemed really happy like he was having a great time And then…when we were nine… his mother passed away Yeah… We were still nine He was still a wimp, always clinging to his mother… but she died… He didnt come to school from that day… I wondered what he was doing, so I went looking for him and I found him on the riverbank where his mother had died He was there with his book bag on his back When he got tired, hed crouch down, but then hed stand up again Day after day, he seemed to be searching for his mother, all day long I couldnt bear to see him like that… Ichigo, back then Tatsuki… I killed my mom… The one who killed your mother… Wasnt it a Hollow What an idiot I am… Hey, Rukia! What is it, Kon Didnt I tell you not to come out until I called you But, Rukia, its pretty hot in here I cant take it Cant we go home yet Didnt I tell you Weve got to stay near him, or well be too late if a Hollow makes an appearance Thats all you think about, Hollow, Hollow, Hollow…! Listen, if your job is all you think about, youre going to lose all your friends! Oh… Awk! I-Im sorry Are you mad What is it Hm…I sure slept well… Huh Good morning! You! I get nothing but these trying missions, you see I cant keep them up unless I get plenty of sleep S-Soul Reaper… Oh, no! Oh, no! Mission…you said See ya! Yeah See you tomorrow! Oh! Oh my… What a mean truck driver Are you all right Im sorry Lets switch places Ill walk on the road side Its okay Im wearing a raincoat, so Im all right Ill protect you from stuff like what just happened My, how reliable… But no… I cant let you take the road-side so long as you cant beat Tatsuki! I won a point from her last time There, youre all cleaned up Hm Lets go! Huh Mom, can I hold your hand Of course I would always feel at ease… whenever my mother was nearby Huh Whats that girl doing Back then, I still couldnt tell the difference between humans who were living and those who were dead – Wait a minute, Mom! – Ichigo… No, Ichigo! When I was really little, my dad told me they gave me the name Ichigo which contains the meaning to completely protect one thing you set your mind on When I heard that, I decided to protect my mother I decided that, but… I dont know what caused it… but it was clear that it happened as she tried to save me I just loved my mom Not only me…so did Yuzu and Karin, who were only four And Dad loved Mom, too Our whole family revolved around her And she was snatched away… from that center… by me Kurosaki Family Tomb 		Its been a while, Mom… 		Have you been well Well, if youre dead, theres no being well or not, I guess Were all doing great – me, Yuzu, and Ichigo, too Quit crying, already, Yuzu You do this every year Were 11 already this year, were grownups I know… I know that, but… You dont know anything… Now, now, now! Cheer up! Its time now for our annual Kurosaki Family Headstone Dominoes Tournament! A full two-and-a-half hours of tombstone toppling– Why dont you go and start your life over from scratch! Therell be some wardrobe malfunctions, too… To be honest, that shaggy guy has so much energy its annoying Therell even be some peeks! Go away! Wait! Just who are you Answer the question Its been a while… The name Rukia Kuchiki was famous back at the Soul Reaper Academy Adopted into the noble Kuchiki family… you were known as the  Princess from the Rukon District Oh, and Im Eikichiro Saidoh I was two years ahead of you You remember me, dont you Come on!

Theyre getting pretty irritated over there… They wonder why you havent come back Hollows appear Orders come in too Thats why I havent gone back Thats all there is to it Then why are you dressed like that Dressed What does it matter, how I dress! Oh, well, I guess youre finally coming of age What are you talking about Dont hide it Dont hide it Its him, isnt it The guy whos mother is said to have been killed by a Hollow The guy with the spiked hair! What are you Is it pity Or, are you looking for pleasure in the human world Its none of your business! Shall I sew that mouth of yours shut! Dont be so embarrassed Its best to be straightforward But…doing it with a human boy… Guess you cant say it–! No good, huh… Too bad I thought that would be a good excuse If I dont get an answer the superiors will be happy with, Ill have to take you back, even if I have to drag you Is that a threat Well… I have no intention of returning for a while Now youve done it… I have no choice Rukia! Rukia! Hey! Who are you! Yo, Spiky! You can see me Kon, who is this guy How should I know What! Youre the one who said it was an emergency! Hey, Spiky… What about you Who are you Im… Ichigo! Dont!

W-What! D-Damn it! Huh! Ughh… Its the end! Huh! Ugh… Stupid Ichigo… Interesting You transformed, and youre a human How did you get that ability As if Id tell you after attacking me out of the blue!

" Yuzu Youre noisy I guess one hostage is enough Karin! Very well I still have a hostage Ive been waiting for you, Shinigami Karin! Ichi-nii That guy Whats going on You bastard Youre the one who was\non the bank that day, arent you Six years ago! Why are you here Six years ago Ichigo, you dont mean Yeah That day, I tried to save this kid But when I woke up, he had disappeared and my mom was my mom was Six years ago I dont remember anything that long ago I see, this is interesting The Ground Fisher Thats its codename It hides itself and makes the appendage growing\nout of its head take human form Then any human who can see it in other words, any human with\na soul of high spirit density becomes fodder to increase its power That Hollow has evaded us Shinigami for over 50 years And its favorite meal is women Which means this thing killed my mom Ah, I see Youre a lucky kid to have survived after seeing me At first, I may have been trying to eat you\nbecause of your great spirit power But women just look so tasty You bastard There arent many Hollows that piss me off as much as this one Karin! Dont be careless, you fool! Ichigo! Youre the only one Ill NEVER forgive! Disintegrate, Black Dog of Rondanini! Look upon yourself and burn; tear away your own throat! Way of Binding, Number 9 GEKI! Dont disturb me! Now then, Im going to eat this girl What are you going to do Karin! STOP! So, youll be good and let me eat you Karin!! Hey You Why did you do that Shinigamis keep fighting the Hollows, no matter what Shinigamis never forgive Hollows Because of Hollows attacking indiscriminately precious people are lost and only emptiness is left I wont forgive that Protect them, spiky boy You understand, dont you Hey! Dont tell me he died even though hes a Shinigami Even Shinigamis are not immortal The form may be different, but death is- Wait, that bastards sleeping Hey, wake up! Thats confusing! Nee-san! W-Whoa, this is getting jacked up Kon! Take the sisters and run away! What about you, Nee-san Hurry! Yes, maam! Ichigo, back me up Ichigo! Rukia, stay back What are you saying This time, you mind your own business Ill do this alone! Dont be ridiculous! That thing is strong I told you It has avoided the Shinigamis for over 50 yea- Shut up Please Dont interfere This is MY fight! Uh Karin A-Are you okay Its exhausting to keep my brow furrowed all the time! How does that freakin Ichigo keep his face like this! Geez! Too slow, boy Damn With your abilities, I m surprised you had the guts\nto tell me to stay away from your friends Eh, boy Shut up After mom died I couldnt imagine how sad Yuzu felt I couldnt imagine how lonely Karin felt Protect them, spiky boy I decided I would protect them Im going to beat this bastard! Didnt your friend tell you not to be careless How many times now have you lunged\nat your enemy without a plan Thats the definition of careless, boy! Impulsive Youre impulsive! You sent away your comrade based on a fleeting emotion and on a fleeting emotion, you lunge at your enemy And in this way, you will perform for\nmy amusement and die at the end! Ichigo! Stay away Keep away, Rukia! Im going to beat him Even if my arm gets severed Even if my leg gets tossed Ill beat him! That is why you will die Because you are young, you anger easily Because you anger, your heart is in chaos And because your heart is in chaos, your blade is dulled Its over, boy! You are far too young to fight with me! Ichigo, is that You son of a bitch Even the most hardened of Shinigamis have\nat least one person they could never kill That is absolute By finding that person, I have so far evaded the Shinigamis And for you, that person must be this woman Thats right, isnt it Ichigo Ichigo! And what of pride If you help him now, yes, you can probably save his life But at the same time, it will kill his pride for all eternity Listen to me Remember this well There are two kinds of fights We must always know the difference A fight to defend life and a fight to defend pride Thats right This is a fight for Ichigo to defend his pride a fight I musnt interfere with Dont interfere Dont interfere Dont interfere Dont die, Ichigo! Ah, crap I fell asleep Damn Can you raise your sword to this woman You bastard Do you have any idea what youre doing Dont bring out my moms image in a place like this! Dont, Ichigo Put your sword away Dont kill mommy Please I told you Anger dulls the blade It will be over with the next attack, boy Let me pay my respects to you Of all the Shinigamis Ive encountered, you\nwere the youngest, the most impulsive and by far, the WEAKEST! Ichigo! What! Is that Mom Thats the mothers soma Her wish has taken form Are you saying the lure remembered his mothers dying wish Dying wish I glimpsed her earlier This fights still up in the air Ichigo Im so proud Dad Karin Yuzu and you, Ichigo Im truly proud to have known you Ichigo, live Be strong Be gentle And smile Ichigo, thank you Ichigo Mom Thats what you were thinking that time Anger dulls the blade You may be right But Youre wrong about one thing To beat a loser like you a dull blade is more than enough! If I were the rain that binds together the earth and the sky,\nwho in all eternity will never mingle would I be able to bind the hearts of people together Kurosaki-kun I feel like I can understand you a little bit Shit! I wont forgive you! Just a mere Shinigami! Come back here! Ichigo! Stop it! Thats enough Neither you nor he can fight anymore The fight is over! Not yet! Hes not dead yet! I still havent- Ichigo! You survived Ichigo Thank you Hes one bad ass kid A Shinigamis spirit power is the same thing as his life force He could become a monster some day Well then, Im goin home Im not crazy enough to tear apart a serious couple Ill just tell them Rukia-chans reached that age Dont! Okay, Ill just make something up Anyway, if they find out, they find out Buh-bye! Sorry I wasnt able to avenge you, Mom Well, as long as you show her youre healthy,\nshe can rest assured on the other side Dont eavesdrop on your son talking to himself I thought you quit She complimented me on it when we first started dating Your hand looks cool when youre smoking, she said Thinking about it now, that was the first\nand the last time she complimented me So I smoke just this one day every year Here in front of her How can you smile Why isnt anyone blaming me! This is too hard! If youd just tear into me, itd be easier Why Why should I blame you If I blamed you for Masakis death, shed get angry at me It wasnt anyones fault that Masaki died Its just that the woman I fell in love with was a woman\nwho didnt mind dying to protect her kid And dont forget youre the man who the woman I fell\nin love with lost her life to protect Dad Owww! Live to the fullest, Ichigo Live to the fullest age to the fullest go bald to the fullest and die long after I do And if possible, die with a smile Otherwise, I wont be able to look Masaki in the eye Dont be wishy-washy Youre still too young to look cool carrying your grief around Ill be waiting down below You listening, Rukia Let me be a Shinigami for a little longer I want to get stronger More More Stronger so I can protect them from Hollows protect the people being targeted Im going to beat him! Otherwise I wont be able to face my mom! Ichigo That was a fearsome Hollow! This time, I was pitiful, but Next time, the man, the one Kon-sama will stride over flowers and storms alike and go full force for Rukia-onee-chan You dont have a line in the next episode"

The charismatic medium of this new century The messenger from the Underworld MisterDonKanonji! Spirits…are always… with you! Live Broadcast of Special Program Checking Out Spiritual Hot Spots: Ghostly Screams in an Abandoned Hospital Bohahahaha! Huh Theres almost no reaction Dont you know what this means B-Burarei Correct! Isnt it a fun show Then, Ichigo, can you join – Bohaha-- – Banzai! T-Tatsuki! What is it Cmon, Ill join you on the Bohaha thing Why… Yo! Ichigo! – Asano here – And Mizuiro Bohahaha! Not going! Why! Its the best Japanese TV program on! And its coming to Karakura Town for a live broadcast! Youd have to be dead to be a citizen of this town and not go! So Im a zombie Big deal Now, get lost I even asked Rukia! Hello Ichigo Look, Rukia Bohahaha! Oh no Im too embarrassed to do it Oh come on, Rukia Do it That woman! Shes adding to her repertoire of tricks Kanonji! He’s so cool! How are you all Ill let you babies listen to the cries of the spirits tonight! Well, Mr Kanonji How is this place This place reeks with the smell of spirits This really Smells like bad spirits! Bohahaha! Bohahaha! Cut to commercial! I hate shows about spirits Everyone, please follow the guide to the spirit purification hall! Kurosaki! Huh Umm… Im sorry about the other day For what Tatsuki said that you dont like these kinds of programs I didnt know Its all right I dont mind Bohahahahaha! Look at those guys, even though they know I hate it But you still came Why is that My dad and sister are big fans of this show And thats why you came I guess Couldnt just let them come alone Youre very kind, Kurosaki Huh Isnt it normal Uh-huh, youre right Its normal Normal Hey Orihime! Were leaving you behind! Tatsuki, wait! Geezall these people! All caught up in this Whats the matter, Ichigo Bohahaha! Why you--! Now now, whats that serious look for Take advantage of this and enjoy it Shut up, Im always like this You must be exhausted from school and Soul Reaper work There will be hard battles ahead Use this opportunity to spread your wings Rukia, you… By the way, just what is this festival about You came along without knowing! Geez, are there really spirits in an abandoned hospital like this Why If there were, wouldnt you Soul Reapers have helped it cross over Not necessarily Spirits that inhabit a place like this are usually Fixed-location jibaku spirits Since these spirits assimilate into the earth, theyre rarely detected by the Soul Society or Soul Reapers There is only one condition under which Fixed-location jibaku spirits show themselves When humans invade their territory Whats the matter, Chad Do you hear something Huh C-Cut it out, Chad Youre giving me the creeps Maybe its just your imagination Maybe Sorry, Im just imagining it I shouldnt have come, after all Huh Whats wrong, Karin Nothing Its the cry of a Fixed-location jibaku spirit It seems there is one, after all Its not a Hollows cry Youre aware that the occurrence of Hollows follows several patterns One is when a Fixed-location jibaku spirit who feels a strong attachment to this world is left alone and ends up becoming a Hollow Such as this spirit Then he’s… called a Plus, one on the verge of becoming a Hollow a Demi-Hollow He feels like a Hollow to me, thats for sure But hes not wearing that white mask Also, the hole in his chest isnt fully opened yet The hole in a Hollows chest signifies that the heart is lost and has become a mass of simple instincts The skull-shaped white mask shields the bared instincts from the outside world Neither of these is necessary if the heart is still intact When a human dies, the chain of fate is severed from the body Usually the spirit waits for a Soul Reaper to guide it, but if they have regrets and cannot let go, their chains become bound to the object of their regret This Demi-Hollows heart is being held by the hospital This hospital is mine! I wont let anyone have it! You guys better not come in! Im going to become a rich man here! – And Im gonna ride a pink Cadillac, – What a disgusting spirit! – and drink pink Dom Perignon! – Coming back from commercial! Somethings about to begin! Spirits are always with you! – Bohahaha! – Bohahaha! Hey, is this okay! Dont get excited It usually takes several months to become a Hollow Now then, the time has come for Mr Kanonjis purification of the spirit! We dont want the spirit to become agitated with this many people around We can do the Konso after the festival But There is a frightening scream just before one becomes a Hollow, it will be in much pain Does that Demi-Hollow look to be suffering to you Huh Who are you! Are you going to taint my hospital, too! Youve got guts! Look at that weird hat!! Doesnt look like it to me You see Unless the partially closed hole in his chest is damaged in some way, itll take another half a year to become a Hollow Ill let you cross over peacefully, baby! Ohhh! There it is! The Super Spirit Cane! For him to use it at this early stage is truly unusual! Whats he doing! That fool! It will only speed up the process of becoming a Hollow! Yes! Kiru-kiru-au-nan, au-maku-kiru-nan! Stop it! Whats that guy doing Security! Hurry it up! This way! Transform into a Soul Reaper! Get her! Let go! No! Let me go, dammit! Who did that! Hello… Geta clogs and hat dude Dont just sit there Hurry and go! R-Right! Hey! What happened! Why are you here Yes Move, leave this to me Hey you! Stop it! What! Mr Kanonji is flying through the air! W-Whats with you, boy! Can you see me too Of course! Im the charismatic medium of this new century! I see! Youre dead, and youre a fan, huh, boy Youre gonna get it, punk! Dont tell me Im too late! He disappeared! Yeah! Mission complete! – No way! – The soul purification is complete! No In the instant a Demi-Hollow turns into a Hollow, it disperses then reforms in another location Furthermore, if his heart was held by this place Kanonji! Kanonji! Kanonji! Yeah! Thank you! Above you, Ichigo! Look up! W-What is that! Thats called a Hollow, and Hmm I feel it, I feel it! It reeks of a super dangerous spirit I get it! You must be the evil boss come to avenge that soul! Not really T-The pain Let me eat you! – Hold it! – Huh! Run, boy! Come on, bad spirit! Don Kanonji, the charismatic medium of the new century, will take you on! Ill devour you! Whatre you doing! Why didnt you run away, boy Youre the one who should run away! Huh Run! What are you saying Damn! Just as I thought Wonderful! Although the conditions are the worst So, what will you do Golden chance! Get away! Whats going on! – Mr Kanonji did some unusual moves – I see – then went into the building! – So thats how youre going to fight The glass at the entrance is shattered, and the walls are destroyed Mr Kanonji must be battling with some unknown force! Dont worry A Hollow of that level wont be a problem for Kurosaki But! Its not good to create too much of a fuss Besides, Kanonji seems to have a bit of power Lets let them handle it W-Why are we running away, boy! Youre the one who said to run! I meant only for you to run! I cannot run away! Huh! Why should I run while you stay! Explain that! Well Well, I I am the hero, thats why! Huh Are you aware of the ratings that my show pulls in Im not gonna bother answering Correct! 25% One in every four citizens watches my show And many of those viewers are children! The children watch my every move and become inspired They see me stand up to evil spirits and understand what courage is Do you understand, boy I cannot run away when these children are watching! Kanonjiyoure Now, lets go back and fight that monster Wha--! Fool! You cant! What if the audience gets involved!

I know my power, and I know the difference in power between the enemy and myself But I have been impressed by you You put the safety of others first Great! You are my comrade, let me call you friend Errthats all right Arghh! Kan’onji Style Ultimate Technique! Cannon Ball! Kanonji!

W-Whats the fuss just cuz we were on TV Just cuz! Havent you realized that youre here precisely because of that lack of awareness! Im flabbergasted!

Hmm I wanted him to take a look at my Soul Pager I cant tell if its broken or not Found him! Lets go sing some karaoke The worker there-- Kurosaki! Come with me a moment! Rukia is quite aggressive I think they really are seeing each other Its a Hollow A Hollow I hope its really there this time Shut up! Lets go! Sorry! After all this! There was no Hollow again!

Ill get that bastard the next time we meet That bastard Ummwhat did he say his name was Ishida err Willy Nope Thats that celebrity no one likes Ishida Ishida again Inoue! Ohno Uryu Ishida, right Huh Yeah him! Youre well informed, Inoue Im really not But Ishida and I are in the Handicrafts Club So I know his name, at least Handicrafts Club! See Thats Ishida T-Thats him And hes in the Handicrafts Club Yup Look Conveniently, Michiru brought a torn stuffed animal Very convenient turn of events indeed Watch I-Its fixed! Thank you, Ishida! No problem Its no big deal Huh Im sorry Hed be nice if he didnt say things like that He sure is weird Say, Ichigo Did something happen between you and him Just something minor Its no big deal I see You plan on following me home Ichigo Kurosaki Damn, you knew When did you notice From the time you and Inoue watched me from the door Hmm Im impressed Youre something else Your spiritual energy is always leaking out, like a fool Even a monkey would notice What! I think youre lacking the ability to detect those with high spiritual energy The proof lies in the fact that you didnt notice my existence until today Sorry about that Im bad at remembering peoples faces Im not talking about that From the time you entered school I knew that you had unusually high spiritual energy Also, that you became a Soul Reaper around the middle of May AndI know Rukia Kuchikis true identity Spirit Ribbons! Yes, Spirit Ribbons The compression and manifestation of spiritual energy in the atmosphere And Whats this…! Your Spirit Ribbon You dont know Soul Reapers Spirit Ribbons have different colors Let us duel, Ichigo Kurosaki You or me Ill show you who is the stronger And also, that Soul Reapers arent necessary in this world Urahara Store 		Its a duel! Rock, Paper Scissors! Look away, then show! Rock, Paper Scissors! Look away, then show! I guess its your turn to sweep, Jinta I didnt lose! I havent lost yet! I said its two out of three! You never said that! Never! Owwee! Oweee! Quit complaining! One more time, I said! Whatare you doing, Jinta 3 m 		e 		t 		e 		r 		s 		OhnothingTe…Eh…MrTessai! Huh You have some business today, Kuchiki Huh Whats the matter Is Urahara here Its Kuchiki! What can I do for you–! What can I do for you! I called you time and time again, but you never answer! So Ive come! Oh, Im sorry Weve been quite busy lately Say, what happened to that spiky-haired guy Well, I dont like him, so its better that he stayed away Hey Jinta! I need to ask you something What is it A duel You and me That’s right Hah! Thats ridiculous! What Why do I have to do such a stupid thing! I dont know what kind of grudge you have against Soul Reapers, but it’s got nothing to do with me How unexpected Youre trying to get out of it Dont try to goad me into it Besides, it would be no contest I see I just remembered Youre a Soul Reaper who received your powers from Kuchiki Youre a substitute Soul Reaper Without her authority, you can’t even lift a finger What! Quincy I havent heard that name in a long time It has a nostalgic ring to it, doesnt it Its been nearly 200 years since we heard that name Whats it mean Quincy A tribe which once existed scattered throughout the world, which specialized in destroying Hollows They became extinct about 200 years ago Extinct Yes Humans who had powers like Kurosaki sensed the existence of Hollows and began to train to fight against them thats how the tribe started Like Soul Reapers, their mission was to destroy Hollows However, there was one distinct difference between them and Soul Reapers And that was, whether to kill Hollows or not The Soul Reapers seek to purify Hollows with their Zanpaku-to and allow them to cross over into the Soul Society But Quincys sought to totally kill them When you think about it, it was a very human thing to do Hollows devour human souls They hurt and kill our friends and family So why would you want to send them to the Soul Society peacefully It was only natural that they opposed it So they always tried to kill Hollows They believed that they were avenging their comrades But due to that belief, they were destroyed Fine! Lets do it Well have a duel! Hey Ichigo! Huh You mayve been obeying Rukias orders, but how dare you stuff me in that bag! Let’s change Hey, wait! Not again! Got it! Slimy Kon, watch me Im gonna kick his butt! Huh All right, explain it to me the rules of this battle Hurry! Though the voyage must continue on May seas always be calm When the cycle of the moon has renewed may it shine Its light to guide your boat I offer this voyage a prayer With each new day that still awaits On vividly shining seas To the end of the journey Im Rukia Kuchiki, the prettiest girl in Bleach! Rukias Q & A Corner 		Id like to read you some 		letters today First from Momoko in the Nakano District Rukia, what is the secret to your beauty This is not the place for that! – Im waiting for your letters! – No way!

Don’t make such a fuss, braggart No need to worry about other people I’ll kill every single Hollow that comes If you are confident that you can protect others from Hollows, then you should accept this challenge That’s number one What kind of face is that, Ichigo Kurosaki Change it back! Chase away the Hollows! Soon, the town will be overflowing with Hollows lured here by the bait Let’s just say the die is cast Huh! Isn’t there something else you should be doing, besides grabbing onto me That’s if you really want to protect as many people as possible from the Hollows Why you--!

He hasn’t noticed, after all That there are people around him with high spiritual powers besides his family But don’t worry I’ll kill every one of them Andyou’ll realize how weak your own power is, here at the point of no return I detest Soul Reapers!

You and I are butt friends! Aghh! It’s so annoying! Huh! Oh, I’m sorry What is it Umm it’s not that important, but Hey, what’s going on!

What a bad feeling I’ve had this feeling before Hmm Cut it out, will you! I’m eking out a living with what I make from my part-time job! My life’s as tenuous as a bug’s!

Where are you going! I don’t know what that big thing is, but if it’s targeting me, then it’s simple I just have to run Run to where there’s no one around Run! Oops, sorry Kurosaki! What’s with you anyway You space out then kick the ball just anywhere Are you serious about playing! Huh W-What, y-you wanna fight Then bring it on! We’ll show you I’m sorry I think I’ll go home, after all Huh H-Hey! Wait, Kurosaki!

Leave it to a girl! Ill say! Lets go! Don’t tell me you hit someone again, Yasutora What’s the point of hitting someone You hurt those who hurt you, and what’s left Yasutora, you are strong You are big You are beautiful You were born with everything people wish from God People who are different are suppressed I don’t know about other things, but that’s the way things are in this world But Yasutora You must be kind You must learn why you have such big, strong fists Find out I know, Grandpa My fists aren’t big so that I can hurt others My bodyis big so that I can protect I know all that I know that But that’s why even just a little I want you to lend me your strength! Whatis that arm Mister! Mister! Your arm! Is it all right So un-cool! Why would you make a gesture like that! Mister!

You scared, Kurosaki Huh If youre scared, stay and watch Im the victor of this match! Over here, Hollows! I, Uryu Ishida, the last Quincy, will take you on! The last Quincy The Quincy became extinct 200 years ago No, that’s not quite right To be exact… the Quincy were destroyed by the Soul Reapers This was a very difficult choice for the Soul Reapers The Soul Reapers had to destroy the Quincy… in order to prevent the destruction of this world In the Soul Society, Soul Reapers were commonly called Balancers, or regulators Regulators The sum of all the souls in the Soul Society and the human world does not change much And souls can travel between the two worlds It is the job of Soul Reapers to regulate that However, one day, the Quincy appeared The Quincy totally destroy Hollows This means that any soul who left the Soul Society for the human world would never return If it were left as is, the balance between  the two worlds would collapse! And the two worlds would end There were many meetings between the Quincy and Soul Reapers… But the Quincy refused to heed our pleas And the order was given to annihilate the Quincy Do you think that this resulted from the arrogance of Soul Reapers Damn! Their numbers arent going down Sensei…! Ishida…! H-Hes so rash! I heard… The reason why you fight! I dont know who was right…  the Quincy or Soul Reapers And I dont intend to tell you! But, one thing I do know! Your ways are… That storys old Huh I dont care about the slaughter of 200 years ago I only heard it from my teacher myself Furthermore, when I heard that story, I sort of sided with the Soul Reapers That is, until my Sensei died… Huh! I felt that the Quincy were at fault for refusing to listen at all to the Soul Reapers But why! It was the Quincy who were annihilated You are right So many died And as long as there were casualties, thinking about who was right or  who was wrong is meaningless What we must think about is how we can prevent this from ever happening again That is all Its hard to see the sadness  in the faces of humans and Soul Reapers He was a kind, gentle man who never hated or resented anyone! As the last Quincy, Sensei was under strict watch by the Soul Reapers And yet, Sensei kept telling  the Soul Reapers to join forces and fight together But the answer was always the same: Do not interfere with our work Then on that day five huge Hollows appeared… and it was obvious that he couldnt take them on without the help of Soul Reapers Soul Reapers only appeared two hours after Sensei had begun to fight If they had listened to Sensei, if they had acknowledged his strengths, and his thoughts… They would have come to the rescue much sooner And Sensei wouldnt have had to die! Can you understand, Ichigo Kurosaki I must prove to the Soul Reapers, the strength of the Quincy! I realize that our ways of thinking are at opposite poles If you think my way is wrong, stay there and watch… My true strength… You talk too much! Whatre you doing! I just dont get it! Your teachers hope wasnt to prove the power of the Quincy to the Soul Reapers… It was to join forces with the Soul Reapers to fight, right! Well then… Just when will you be able to do that, if not now! Opposite poles Fine! When you have many opponents,  the best way to fight is back-to-back! Good! Dont get me wrong Unless I shot, Id have been killed That’s fine! Kill or be killed But its too hard by yourself So it cant be helped Isnt that enough… of a reason to join forces I just want to destroy Hollows Why My mother… was killed by a Hollow Is that the reason why I want to destroy Hollows If you ask that, of course, it is But… I just dont want others to go through what I did After my mother was killed, my dad and my sisters went through a lot I just dont want any more of that I dont wanna see that anymore Thats how I feel Its hard to see the sadness in the faces… I cant say bold things like Ill protect all the people of the world… But I dont want to just protect those I can carry in my arms I want to protect lots  and lots of people! Your way of doing this would end up involving too many people! No way! But this is no time to be saying that We can only join together! What do you say! Geez… you talk too much, too But I understand Unless we survive, we wont have a sparring partner for later Fine! Kurosaki! Huh The sky… Sky What…is that! Huh! Thats…! W-What is that Its huge… That bait cant have this kind of result… Its too late now! Dammit! H-Hello… Jinta home run! Kurosaki, we came to help you Hat-and-Clogs! Well take care of the small fry So that you, Kurosaki, can concentrate on fighting that one Oops, you dont have time to listen to my rambling Its Menos… Menos A gigantic Hollow borne from hundreds of Hollows mixed and folded together… But Ive only seen such a thing in illustrations in school books Menos Grande I cant believe it! That such a thing would come out… This is the jurisdiction of the Royal Special Task Force Its not something just one Soul Reaper can take on! Look at the size of that thing! No sense in thinking about how to fight such a giant What A thing like that… has to be cut and cut again, with all your strength! Theres no other way! Lets do it, Ishida! Hold it, Kurosaki! Ichigo! Stop! Hes not an opponent  you can take on! Urahara! Do you intend to kill Ichigo! Not at all But just watch This battle…is necessary This is…a Binding Spell For you and him Kurosaki! I told you so… Dammit! Kurosaki, can you stand Yeah, Im sort of okay What were you thinking! Just how did you plan on destroying that thing like that Well I figured if I kept cutting him from the feet up, the head would fall eventually This isnt “Pull the Blocks Out”! Geez! I cant believe the way you think! Now stand… and think up a new strategy What is…! Its flowing in… Is this from Kurosakis power A new strategy, huh Kurosaki! Huh Aghh! W-Whats with that arrow! Howd it get so big! Just listen! We may be able to beat that thing Huh! Can you see Ishida… and Ichigo, whos next to him Yes He asked that we watch from here… Does he mean watch, and then choose…the path we walk Actually…Actually, I havent forgotten a single thing I could only doubt my own memories Chad… Hmm What are we supposed to do All right, now we can fight! Hey, are you crazy What! Quit babbling! In this situation, if you release all your spiritual energy in this form, Ill be able to shoot an enormous arrow! We cant waste all that spiritual energy! Dont say waste Come on! Control your spiritual energy and release it all at once! How What Cant you do that Then how did you fight Hollows until now I just went with the flow The flow! Thats crazy! I dont understand stuff like that! If my spiritual energy is high, isnt it always at maximum level Sero Does he intend to release Sero here! Run! Hurry! If you get hit, therell be nothing left of you! Theres no other way! Kurosaki, grab that sword again and… Kurosaki! Whatre you doing! What! What is this terrible Spirit Pressure Kurosakis power is increasing! Isnt it always at maximum level! Thats right, theres no way that can be No matter how high your spiritual energy, if its always at maximum… the energy will burn out in no time! If he cant control his spiritual energy, it means he always has more than enough spiritual energy If you turn on a faucet and a large amount of water flows out… most people will quickly turn it off If hes like that… If his usual spiritual energy… is always held back like that… And if through some incident, it gets turned on… Its almost time, I think What! Menos is turning back! I win! What the hell is he! Impressive! I can see why  the Boss had his eyes on him Yo! What At least say thanks I just saved your butt The least you can say is thanks I dont have any more strength… W-Whaa--! Whats going on! The shape of the Zampakuto is deteriorating! Its because he released his energy so suddenly! At this rate, his body wont hold up! I must do something! I know! This should do it… If I release the spiritual energy which Kurosaki is unable to control… W-Whatre you doing! Shut up! Your hand…its tearing apart! Shut up! I told you, didnt I If we both dont survive, Ill lose my sparring partner! Stay alive, so that I can beat the hell outta you! Ichigo Kurosaki! And you can do the same to me! Ichigo Kurosaki! Forgive me, Sensei! I tried to look away… by hating Soul Reapers I didnt want to look at myself… Because I couldnt save you Today, I will save a Soul Reaper Can you forgive me I couldnt give my life for you… Im a weak apprentice… Please… can you forgive me Grandfather Sheesh… How am I supposed to beat a guy who looks like that With much appreciation I send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts To the people who have always held me up Thank you for everything Thank you so much Wherever I may be I’ll always be grateful for who you are I was casually walking through town Around the time dusk fell and the city was bathed in red It was an afternoon with crowds of people coming and going I don’t know why but I just stood there and watched Then my cell phone started to vibrate and I made myself move hoping it could fill in this hole in my heart You’re not alone You see, everybody We gotta hold each other up With much appreciation I send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts To the people who have always held me up Thank you for everything Thank you so much Wherever I may be I’ll always be grateful for who you are Hey, how are you all Im Kon, the superstar of the world of Bleach!

I found you, my goddess Orihime… – Earlier was just a rehearsal – Go, Orihime! Hang in there! – Hime!

This isnt supposed to happen! I did it! A one-run lead! Yakka = soccer and baseball 		Orihime, I think your game of Yakka 		isnt fair to the defense And a one-run lead isnt cause for a celebration yet!

I just felt like itthats all I didnt ask you because I like you So just be grateful I asked at all As if Id be grateful! Besides, I prefer to eat alone I like to be alone when I eat, too Well then Just look the other way – Why should I be  the one to look away – These two Theyre so alike All together now! Tadah! Todays lunch is Castella sandwich! Castella sponge cake with bean jelly is the ultimate for sweets lovers Not again Orihime, how come she can eat such things and not gain weight All the nutrients are going to her breasts, thats why Kuchiki, do you like Kurosaki What Or, to put it bluntly Just what is your relationship with Kurosaki Well, we’re frie-- Mahana, that was way too bold! Why Youre the ones who want to know, but cant ask So I popped the question for you Err Well Im not that interested Maybe, not you You dont care for Ichigo anyway, Michiru Well, its not that I dont like him His face just looks a bit scary Really I think he has an interesting face Huh When did you get over your fear of Kurosaki Well Whats the story Kurosaki is Kurosaki is just a friend – Are you serious – Yes You dont feel anything for him Not at all Not at all Too bad! If you like Kurosaki, then Id have to start liking him and Tatsuki can start liking him and why don’t we all start liking him Then it would have been a sure win for the girls team!

Its all over, punk! You will lose to Renji Abarai, and die on this spot! BLEACH 17 Sorry, kid But thats whats known as a difference in strength The Zanpaku-to changes in size and shape depending on its wielders spiritual energy And this is the manifestation of my spiritual energy! Well kid, I think its about time I got going I dont like the air here One attack will show him the difference in strength, make him realize that he has no chance, and back down while his wound is not serious That was my hope But Ichigo would never give up because of such a reason I knew that Are you ready Can you still move, Ichigo Then run! Please, hurry! No answer Run! What are you doing, Rukia! Hey! Let go! Are you trying to deepen your guilt! Let go, you fool! Run, Ichigo! Stand! Stand and run! Ichigo! What You still have the strength to move Fine I was just thinking that its no fun to finish off someone who cant move anymore Well then, fight hard and die! Ichigo, if you can stand, get away! Run, Ichigo! Ichi--! Whats the matter If you wont attack, I will! What is this sudden increase in his Spiritual Pressure! What the hell…! Whats with this kid! He was about to die earlier! Whered he get all this power Whats wrong Your moves have slowed down considerably Idiot! You just got faster! I dont understand this, but it feels good I dont even feel the pain from the wound! And I dont feel like I can lose! Why you--! Roar, Zabimaru! Renji is being pressured! Ichigo Youre good at dodging around! Whats happening! How much higher can his spiritual energy go! But thats about to end Heavy… I wont make it in time… W-What the--! My Zanpaku-to… No… he didnt do anything Was it him Impossible… He cant do a thing from that distance Huh! Is he coming What happened just now Did he get me I cant even tell if I was hit from the back… or the front It hurts… Youre slow Even when you fall Brother Byakuya! Its been awhile since I saw it, but hes awesome, after all I had to strain to follow his second attack But his first one… I couldnt even tell when he drew his sword, or put it back If I couldnt see it coming… He probably doesnt even know what happened to him Still… What was that extraordinary Spiritual Pressure he demonstrated earlier Whats the matter, Renji No… You didnt need to help me  with a kid of this level, Captain Dont say that If all I did was watch each time… Id get rusty No, this man is… And I am… Ichigo! Ichigo! Stop! Let go, Renji! Ichigo is… What are you saying, fool! Look hard! The kid is dead! Dont you understand! By just touching him, your sentence will increase by 20 years! Why would you multiply your crimes for a dead person! Im the one who got Ichigo involved in this Its my fault hes dead! So whats wrong with my coming to him! So even if it would make your sentence harsher, you cant stay away from this kid Brother… I understand, Rukia This kid…looks a lot… like him I understand, Rukia This kid…looks a lot like him Hes dead, you say Looks a lot like him Quit talking about me like Im not here! Ichi--! Let go I cant hear you Look at me when you speak! This kid can still move! No way! I see… You dont need that arm, huh Huh! W-Whatre you doing, Rukia! Youre just a human… Youre just a human! How dare you grab my brother like that! Know your place, kid! Let us go, Brother! Through his actions just now… I, Rukia Kuchiki, have opened my eyes Please take me back to the Soul Society I will atone for my sins Wait you…! Whatre you saying! Rukia, you…! You dont know when to give up, do you Quit squirming around and die! There is no need to inflict the final blow upon him Leave him and he will eventually die on his own Let us go, Brother Wait, Rukia! What kind of joke is this! Look at me, hey! Hey! Do not move! Take even one step from there… Try to come after me And Ill…Ill… I will never forgive you! You will die anyway… so stay there and live, even if just one second longer Fine I will not inflict the finishing blow With the two attacks just now, Ive shattered his Soul Chain and Hakusui - Soul Sleep, the vital spots of the soul He should die in less than an hour And even if he does survive, his powers will be lost, Soul Reaper power, as well as his spiritual energy Renji Yes Open! I cant speak… I cant move… I was protected…again… Rukia! It hurts My body feels heavy Its cold It doesnt hurt Oh no, am I about to die I probably dont feel pain because Im on the verge of death Thats right… my body was so cold earlier, but Im feeling warmth now Its warm Oh, good reaction! Thats good Y-Youre too close! Boss! Kurosaki is awake! Boss! Ive seen you before! Youre Hat-and Clogs’ friend! Why are you under the covers with me! Get off! Huh! Huh Im not dead! Why And this isnt my house Where am I Now, now You mustnt be up, Kurosaki Your wounds havent closed yet Youll die if you move around too much Hat-and-Clogs I see So this is your house Correct! So you saved me Huh That tone is unexpected It sounds as though you didnt want me to rescue you Oh yeah… Ishida was there, too What happened to him Is he here, too No, he went home He lost a lot of blood, but his wounds werent too serious Even if he lay there like that, he wouldnt have died for a couple of days So I was able to treat most of his wounds there He was worried about you when he left Ishida No way! I asked him to rest here awhile… Thank you very much But Im all right But rather… please take care of Kurosaki If theres anyone who can defeat those guys right now, its not me The only one who can save Rukia… is him So he said Only me What does he expect me to do Rukia has gone back to the Soul Society! How do I go after her! How do I save her! No way can I do that… No way! Do you really believe that Theres a way to get to the Soul Society… Is there a way How How do I get there! Tell me! Of course, Ill tell you But theres one condition Condition Yes For the next ten days, study how to fight with me S-Study! What You want me to train I dont have time! Rukia may be executed over there at any time! We have to get to the Soul Society and…! You just dont get it, do you Huh! What I mean is, if you go there now, you will die Can you beat them If you fought with them now This time, I let you try and fight them Thats because I figured you would understand that better than words With your level of strength now, you wont be of any good in the Soul Society You are weak A weak person entering the enemys den… thats called suicide You want to save Rukia Dont make me laugh Dont use others as a reason for walking straight into deaths arms The Soul Society usually has a one-month waiting period before an execution This holds true in Rukias case, too Execution Its different from the way humans are executed, though I have ten days to bully you Then seven days to open the gate to Soul Society And 13 days after we arrive in Soul Society We will have lots of time Can I become stronger in ten days Certainly! That is if you truly wish to save Rukia from the bottom of your heart Your feelings are stronger than steel Abandon any doubt you have Ten days Can you play a game of life and death with me Of course! I felt as though…the rain stopped With much appreciation I send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts To the people who have always held me up Thank you for everything Thank you so much Wherever I may be I’ll always be grateful for who you are I was casually walking through town Around the time dusk fell and the city was bathed in red It was an afternoon with crowds of people coming and going I don’t know why but I just stood there and watched Then my cell phone started to vibrate and I made myself move hoping it could fill in this hole in my heart You’re not alone You see, everybody We gotta hold each other up With much appreciation I send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts To the people who have always held me up Thank you for everything Thank you so much Wherever I may be I’ll always be grateful for who you are Renji Abarai shows you the Proper way to use the Zanpaku-to! First, you call out the name of your Zanpaku-to to release its power! Then you slash and swing! Slash, and slash, and slash, and slash! Cripes! That’s not explaining anything! Do the preview!"

Why not I know exactly what youre up to! – Is this what it means – Im not even thinking – to go back to the Soul Society – about bathing together or anything! What are you blabbering about! You disappear from this world and from peoples memories Every evidence of her existence disappears into white Now then Thats about it for reminders All right, students, dont die before September! Class dismissed! Yes! That Ishida cut class, after all I thought he might still remember Rukia Ichigo! Turn! Turn! Turn! Turn! Now then, wheres the watermelon No! Thats not it! That’s right!

Why does he always pick on me! Strangenothing feels out of place Even with Rukia gone, our world continues to turn I guess Rukia was originally from the other world There was really no place for her here Then whatll I do Inoue What is it Something wrong Where did Rukia go Why has everyone suddenly forgotten about Rukia I thought you would know, Ichigo Then Rukia returned to the world she came from Yeah But what a shock That you were able to see through us Since when Ever since the incident with my brother Huh I see Yes Im really grateful about that time You guided my brother Im sure hes happy on the other side I can feel it Really Yes I wonder if Rukia is doing well on the other side, too She probably has family and friends, right I have to bring her back Huh Butif shes happy there Shes in a predicament where she could be killed any time Well then, youll probably say this: Who cares if she has family or friends over there As long as shes alive, theyll be able to meet again If shes dead, its all over You already know what you want to do, right She was really here And her place is here Thank you, Inoue! Chad Kurosaki Clinic How boring! Its summer vacation and Ichigo goes off without us! Yuzu, it’s about time you-- All right! How about sleeping in Dads bed tonight Quit your jokes! And just talk in your dreams! Oh, just thinking about that makes me feel uneasy Geethose words really hurt me Good morning, Lieutenant Abarai Mornin’! Wait! Wait! If you fly away, Ill get in trouble! I guess I have no choice Hi! Im Jennifer Im a blood type A, Pisces E-cup bra size and-- What are you doing! Renji! Arent you off duty today Im here to check on the prisoner Is she still sulking I’m not sulking Then, why dont you eat Im just not hungry, “Mr Lieutenant” What! You got a problem that Im the Lieutenant! Not really Way to go, Mr Lieutenant! You are so strong, Mr Lieutenant! Your eyebrows look so weird, Mr Lieutenant! Why you--! Ill kill you! Come out of there, you! Say Renji Huh Am I really going to die Of course! Itll be immediate execution for someone like you! I see I guess so Huh Stupid! I was just joking Just a joke Which is it, idiot Whos the idiot here Making us worry with your antics Captain Kuchiki is probably asking for clemency right now I wonder Fool! Hes your older brother! As if hed let his sister die No He would kill me Huh I know full well what kind of man he is Forty years after being taken in by the Kuchiki family he has never once looked at me URAHARA STORE CLOSED TODAY Huh! What is this! Imagine! A huge cavern beneath the shop! Pipe down! You dont have to yell Im pretty damn surprised Then thats fine Lets get started with this lesson or whatever All right, as you wish Dammit! Whats the big idea! Hard to breathe, huh When youre in the form of a soul Right now, your Soul Sleep, which is the wellspring of your spiritual energy, and the Soul Chain, the booster, have been destroyed In other words, your soul is like that of the average person who has no spiritual power So first, we must restore the spiritual power you have lost Then what do I do! Well, rather than explain it, why dont we just do it Hey, are you ready Nice to see you Lesson one! Please fight her Huh The rules are simple Lesson One will be over once either one of you are rendered immobile Please knock her out Are you kidding! You expect me to hit a little girl like her I think itll be quite difficult Please put those on properly Otherwise, youll die This is so silly! No way! See Dont say I didnt warn you He isnt coming out Did he die I wonder Oh, there he is Oh, hes going after her! Oops, he ran right past her Cripes! What was that! If I get hit with that, I’m dead! Hey! How do I put this on! Ichigo, your forehead! Your forehead! Huh Like this And then, you holler as loud as you can: Take this! Power of justice! Armor of justice! Justice headband! In place! Okay, got it! Awright! As if I can do that! See No time to feel embarrassed Take this! Power of justice! Armor of justice! Justice headband! In place! Well, well, he actually did it Why you--! Behind you! Behind you! Aw man! Awright, come at me! Dammit! This thing isnt any good! Unless I run around like this, Ill be killed! Wait a minute! If I can run around, it means Im keeping up with her speed Then! Come! Oh Hmm I can do it I wont aim for her face Just a little blow to her headgear Then, because of the difference in size, I can Dammit! I got her face! Safe! One more time, please Congratulations! Huh Lesson One is cleared! Huh Why I lost to her, didnt I Oh, I didnt say a thing about downing Ururu to clear Lesson One But After all, she has the fighting skills to counter Soul Reapers No way can a human soul beat her By the way, are you still having trouble breathing Huh Now that you mention it Which means, the restoration of your spiritual energy was successful This lesson was for one-shot battles Whether you could dodge the first attack or not Spiritual energy increases fastest when the soul is in danger of being destroyed If you can raise your spiritual energy sufficiently, then you can dodge the punch and it’s all good! And if I cant Youll die Why didnt you say so first! I had faith in you that you would succeed Now then, your spiritual energy is back Solets celebrate and Huh! Go straight into Lesson Two! Lesson Are you interested in taking it B-But, so out of the blue like that Rather, the problem is The cat What do you mean Hmm Ichigo has begun preparations to enter the Soul Society If you also want to use the powers that have awakened inside you, then take my lessons You can decide whether youre really going or not after that Im going Chad I um I wont force you Oh! There! There! Uryu! Hello! Huh Orihime! Chad! What are you doing here We asked Yoruichi to follow your spiritual aura Yoruichi What are you doing Camping No! Youre training, huh Whos there! Where are you looking Over here Im Yoruichi Huh! A cat! A cat is--! So Whats the big deal just because a cat can talk Dont be such a wimp Yes, Uryu Its no big deal No I dont think its strange if one is mildly traumatized by it Men have such a hard time adapting to things Im sorry But what did you want with me Actually Ichigo is going to the Soul Society Ichigo is going to rescue Rukia So I thought we should tell you, too Unfortunately, its got nothing to do with me Rukias life is in danger! Im a Quincy and I cant forgive myself for losing to a Soul Reaper Thats why I train Rukia is not my concern I see Youre doing your best in your own way, huh Ill think it over carefully again Its certain that Im undergoing changes Im afraid, but I want to know what it is See you, Uryu Sorry Orihime But I cant let anyone see this training Please watch over me, Sensei Im gonna die! Precisely Once the Chain of Fate is broken, you can no longer return to your physical body You’ll just die Quit talking like it doesnt matter! Then, let me tell you something that does The chain will begin the Encroachment at the point of severance And when it reaches your chest, you will become a Hollow and it will be the end What! If you dont want to become a Hollow, you must become a Soul Reaper! Huh! Once you clear Lesson Two, you will regain the powers of a Soul Reaper! Which you choose is your decision Hah! You don’t have to ask me that! Okay! Then lets do it Go! Are you shocked By my ruse Hey hey Its awfully deep I did my best Owwee! Wha--! What are these! Binding Spell 99 – Restrict! It was bold of me, but until this lesson is over, your arms shall be sealed Dammit! Why you--! Ichigo! Climb back up here in that condition That is the lesson otherwise called Shattered Shaft Idiot! As if I can do such a thing! I dont think you have time to wonder whether you can or not At the bottom of the Shattered Shaft, you have 72 hours, or three days, before the chain is completely Encroached You must come back up here as a Soul Reaper before the time is up Otherwise, well have to kill you With much appreciation I send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts To the people who have always held me up Thank you for everything Thank you so much Wherever I may be I’ll always be grateful for who you are I was casually walking through town Around the time dusk fell and the city was bathed in red It was an afternoon with crowds of people coming and going I don’t know why but I just stood there and watched Then my cell phone started to vibrate and I made myself move hoping it could fill in this hole in my heart You’re not alone You see, everybody We gotta hold each other up With much appreciation I send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts To the people who have always held me up Thank you for everything Thank you so much Wherever I may be I’ll always be grateful for who you are Jinta! Ururu! How quickly do you think Ichigo can come back as a Soul Reaper I say five hours! About 12 hours Well, Ill wager a thousand points on him not returning Hold it, you!"

Shattered Shaft! At the bottom of the Shattered Shaft, you have 72 hours, or three days, before the chain is completely Encroached You must come back up here as a Soul Reaper before the time is up Otherwise, well have to kill the Hollow that you become You bastard! You intend to kill me! Oh yeswhen you give up Completely hopeless – Huh! – Huh At this rate, I will never be able to let you enter the Soul Society Oh no Well, of course! Unless you are able to activate your powers at will, you will die a dogs death in the Soul Society! Its not that hard Just remember the first time you used it and retrace those steps Its easier said than done I was so desperate that time What were you so desperate about Huh A person takes a sword when hes trying to protect something Perhaps its your life, social status, reputation loved ones, beliefs Though the motives might differ, theres no difference in the desire to protect something Think back What were you trying to protect back then I see I wastrying to protect Ichigos kid sister A red cap long hair And since shes Ichigos sister She looks like Ichigo a girl Huh! It seems you failed at remembering And what about you I I was at that time I was so desperate So desperate! It shined! Oh really E-Everyone! Did you call When you need us, dont hesitate, just call In this situation why would you need us! What are you doing I-Im sorry I remembered all kinds of things and Owwee! You werent even in danger, yet you called us! You terrible hussy! Tsubaki stop it! It hurts when you kick! Shut up! Im pissed off! – You hussy! – No! Im sorry! Im sorry! Im sorry! – Tsubaki, stop it! – Please! Oh dear Hes uncontrollable! – Tsubaki is so rough – No, stop! Well done – Although, it seems youll need – I said sorry! – practice on taming your power – Please! Now then What about you Why are you going to the Soul Society That was the fifth Encroachment just ending It seems they repeat the cycle of several minutes of Encroachment and sleep During the Encroachment of the chain, I cant move because its so painful I could go blind So I have to act while theyre asleep That kid makes no sense The method is reckless, but hes managing to climb about three meters of this virtually straight-up wall! Oh, my my Idiot Dammit! Hey! Huh Arent you getting hungry Im not! Besides, Im in a soul form! Why would I get hungry! Thats good! Ill tell you something interesting When you get feeling hungry while in soul form its a dangerous sign, that youre just a step away from becoming a Hollow! Huh! Its okay to feel thirsty, though And if you do get thirsty, go ahead and drink my spit Why you--! Here Ururu You too Okay! Come on down! Hey you! Brats! Its coming down! Cut it out! Stop! Ill beat the crap outta you! Stop! Stop, please! I wonder if its dark outside Its hard to tell the time in this room Dammit! I cant climb it How much time has passed I cant tell How can I climb outta this place! I brought you some food I figured youd start feeling hungry Hah! Whatre you talking about! As if Id get hungry! Take a good look Theres still quite a few links to the Chain of Fate I guess it cant be helped if you cant tell time in a place like this Time 70 hours have passed since you came down here Some quick ones start turning into Hollows already Also one more thing The final Encroachment is nothing like the others Huh! A-All the chains! Stop! Stop! All of you! Sto--! Hey hey! Hes going to become a Hollow, after all! Im going into rescue mode Hold it Kisuke Watch him carefully Usually, when a Plus becomes a Hollow the spiritual body first explodes, and then reforms But in his case, the order is all mixed up The body is still a Plus, while the mask is being created first This is proof that he is resisting Theres still a possibility that he will become a Soul Reaper again Lets watch a little longer And see if he truly becomes a Hollow Just for a little longer Ichigo, can you hear me Where am I Over here Who are you Who What are you talking about Its me I cant hear it I see It still cant reach you How sad How many times must I cry out before you can hear me There is no one in this world that knows me better than you do Huh What are you talking about Sorry, but I dont know anyone depressing like you Huh! Hey! Howd you! Im surprised How can you stay seated in a place like that If you can scream, I guess you have time to spare Quite a good sign Do not worry Soul Reapers rule death They control many spiritual beings Imnota Soul Reaper now! Remember! That the Soul Reaper power that Byakuya Kuchiki snuffed out of you was merely the Soul Reaper power you received from Rukia Kuchiki! Of course! That is all he was after He thought that by destroying that, he could end this! He was careless! He overlooked the fact that you have Soul Reaper power of your own! Huh My own Soul Reaper power Thats right The power that was awakening due to Rukia Kuchikis power, hid itself in the very depths of your soul an instant before Byakuya Kuchikis thrust Now find it! If there ever is a time when you could find the power of the Soul Reaper that has hidden itself, then that time is now, when this world has begun its collapse Countless boxes are raining down, and in only one of them lies your Soul Reaper power Find it! Will you cut out this nonsense! I will not abide any excuses There is no time Before this world is completely destroyed, find it Or you will become a Hollow So what do I do How can I pick out one box out of all these, that contains the Soul Reaper power What do I do I just dont have the ability to search for spiritual energy to begin with I think Ishida said the same thing to me Ishida Thats righthow did he find out I was a Soul Reaper You know It was some simple method Did you know He bragged about it but what was it Did you know The Spirit Ribbon of a Soul Reaper is red Thats it! Its this one! What the---! The handle of a Zanpaku-to Youve done well in finding it I hope that next time, you will hear my name Could you possibly be What are you doing! Its crumbling! Hurry and pull me out! Huh! This is the limit, Boss! I am switching to Suppression mode Bakudo 99 Part 2: Ban-kin! First Incantation: Bandage! Second Incantation: Hundred Dead Bolts! Hey Tessai! If you do that, hell die! There is no other way! I cant hold him down any longer! I must destroy him before he becomes a Hollow! Final Incantation: Fatal Seal! This is it! W-What! Somethings coming out! W-What the heck is that! Hey! Is that you Answer, Orange head! If youre alive, answer me! Huh Shihakushoand a mask Is he a Hollow Or a Soul Reaper Dont take me lightly! Come at us if you want! You didnt become a Hollow Congratulations! You went and became a Soul Reaper again! Well done! Lesson Two cleared! Shut up! Hah! Your number is up now that I came back alive! I swore! That when I got out of the hole alive, Id kill you without fail! Perfect timing With that spirit, well go right into Lesson Three Lesson Three has no time limit at all If you can use your Zanpaku-to to knock off my hat, then the lesson will be cleared Not bad, considering your Zanpaku-to is broken Of course! And I havent really gotten down to business yet! No time limit, huh Forget that Lets end this in five minutes Sounds good Five minutes and well end this, huh With much appreciation I send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts To the people who have always held me up Thank you for everything Thank you so much Wherever I may be I’ll always be grateful for who you are I was casually walking through town Around the time dusk fell and the city was bathed in red It was an afternoon with crowds of people coming and going I don’t know why but I just stood there and watched Then my cell phone started to vibrate and I made myself move hoping it could fill in this hole in my heart You’re not alone You see, everybody We gotta hold each other up With much appreciation I send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts To the people who have always held me up Thank you for everything Thank you so much Wherever I may be I’ll always be grateful for who you are In order to release the power of the Zanpaku-to, one has to discover its name and summon it Now then, can Ichigo find it 1000 points says he cant 2000 points says I can! Well then"

Oh, you flatter me! But that doesnt mean Ill go easy! Fine with me! Dammit! Hey! Wait a minute! Hold on a minute! I thought the Zanpaku-to was the only sword that could kill Soul Reapers and Hollows He pulled that sword from his cane It cant be a Zanpaku-to Then even if he did get me, it wouldnt hurt me--! You let down your guard Hes not a Soul Reaper, so it cant be a Zanpaku-to So I cant get hurt even if he cuts me Right You are so naïve Wake up! Benihime… This is a Zanpaku-to, totally authentic Wake up, Benihime! Roar, Zabimaru! You cant even ask the name of your Zanpaku-to! A guy like you… Zanpaku-to’s…name Yes… Each Zanpaku-to has a name And this isher name Lets go… Benihime! I compliment you for not running away and countering my sword with that broken one Thats some courage However… Benihime isnt so kind that shed let a sword like that stop her Dammit! No way! No way can that be! He cut my Zanpaku-to! Werent you told Your sword is big But thats all There’s no concentration of spiritual energy in it It just distends and holds its shape Thats why I can cut it easily like that Now you dont have a sword Will you still attack me with that Cmon, you just have to knock my hat off You can do it with that hilt However, it wont be just courage or guts thats necessary Let me just warn you… If you still intend to fight me with that toy… I will kill you! Huh! Im gonna die! Ill really be killed! Pathetic! What am I Why am I running Is that all I was Is that the extent of my determination Disgusting! Im disgusted with myself! Im so… – helpless! – You are so…helpless Mister… Why do you run, Ichigo You havent called me yet Look ahead, Ichigo You should be able to hear it now It is fear that makes you shut your ears There is only one enemy, and only one you What is there to fear Hey, whats going on Both of them stopped Abandon your fears!

Without this Shield of Blood Mist… Id have lost an arm Oh boy… My hats torn, too But… I didnt think youd do it in one swing… Ichigo… You are one frightening kid Lesson Three cleared! All right It’s complete Thank you, Sensei You did it! Terrific, Chad! You did it! Great! You idiot! Know your limits! Look at the panic youve caused! Now run away from the back All right!

Youre amazing, Tatsuki Hardly Oh yes…Youre amazing! Its been such a long time since we last came here We only come in autumn each year Did I tell you My brother had this terrific knack for catching red dragonflies on his fingers Hed point his fingers to the sky and immediately, a dragonfly would land It was like magic and I loved to watch him Thats why I wanted to be able to do that… But I couldnt… This time, Ill protect you Youre visiting relatives from next week Huh Yes Ichigo said hes going on a trip next week, too Oh, yes… I couldnt be first… Huh But Ive never regretted trying Even if it doesnt turn out well, there are things you discover just by doing your best So…so… Once youve decided, go forward and do it And in exchange…Ill… Ill be waiting here…so… So Fantastic! Terrific! Look at the sky! Its so pretty Aug 8, 1:00am Lets see This should do it In seven days, at 1:00am, leave your window open and wait Im getting bad vibes all over… Nice breeze… W-What is that! Whats happening Please come to the front of Urahara Shop immediately W-What the hell is he doing! This looks like a dying message at a murder scene! I hope it comes off! Whats this… PS PS If you thought this was  like a dying message or something common like that you have no sense of humor! Shut up! Well, Yuzu, Karin…Dad… Good morning! Ichigo! Dodging that attack… – you ARE my son, after all – What the hell are you up to! B-Before you leave, I want to give you this What is this amulet…so dirty How dare you call it dirty! Your mother gave it to me long ago! It is filled with luck and divine grace! W-Whatre you doing! I cant take this! Damn right! Whod give it to you! Who! Im just going to lend it to you during your trip After you return, give it back! Here! What do you say! You give it back, you hear! Ill shave if you lose it! Oh…yeah… Im off then Right! Im a Soul Reaper Slaying a Hollow does not mean killing it Wasnt it a Hollow that killed your mother So many things have happened Youre just a human! How dare you grab my brother like that! And now… You will die anyway… so stay there and live even one more second longer I wont let it be like  it never happened Oh, Ichigo! Right on time! Good, good Chad…why are you here Rukia Kuchiki once saved me Im going, too Huh What! What You didnt hear Ishida…! No way will I remain defeated by those Soul Reapers Im going, too Huh! Now were all here Orihime! Please look after me! Huh! Hey! Whats going on! Pretty slow on the up-take, aren’t you Yoruichi… Kid, dont tell me you didnt notice the increase in the hidden powers of these three While you were training to regain your Soul Reaper power, these three were also training in their own way Instead of criticizing, bow your head and thank them A A cat just spoke! – Hes not a cat Hes Yoruichi – A-A cat! I guess it is shocking, after all It’s his first time meeting him, I guess Yes, yes… thats it We cant keep talking outside Lets go inside Orihime… What is it How much do you know I mean…its going to be dangerous I promised Tatsuki that Id go with you And… I promised to return W-Wow! All this space beneath the shop! This is so neat… its like a secret base! Really What… What a wonderful reaction! I, Tessai, am deeply moved Don’t mention it All right, your attention please! Here we go! This is the gate that leads to Soul Society Its known as Senkaimon, which is written, Tunnel World Gate Now listen very carefully Before that… – Its so easy to come out – Hey, warn me, at least! So Ichigo is no longer inside Ichigo Of course not! Dont talk like Im not here! Lets continue This gate has a layer of Reishihenkanki, Spirit-particle Conversion Machine on top of a normal Senkaimon Spirit-particle… Conversion Machine Yes As you already know, the Soul Society is a world of spirits It is impossible to enter that world unless you have the form of a spirit However, only Ichigo, as a Soul Reaper, can cross through So we will use the Henkanki to convert you into spirits In other words… Even without extracting our spirits, by going through this gate… Correct You will be able to enter the Soul Society like that Okay, got it! – Lets! – However! The time that we have to open the gate and connect it to the Soul Society is… four minutes I-Is that enough time! Normally, it would be impossible What! Its a reckless idea to start with Ill do my very best and hold it for four minutes If you cant cross over in that time… you will be trapped forever between the Soul Society and this world W-What should we do Go forward I told you that the heart and soul are connected The important thing is what you feel in your heart and the will to move it forward I will be your guide Go forward… Only those who can do that can follow me Are you babbling in your sleep or what Thats why were here! You understand, kid, that if you fail, you cannot return So I just have to win, right Exactly Are you ready Run in the instant it opens Right! Lets do it! Im counting on you… Ichigo With much appreciation I send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts To the people who have always held me up Thank you for everything Thank you so much Wherever I may be I’ll always be grateful for who you are I was casually walking through town Around the time dusk fell and the city was bathed in red It was an afternoon with crowds of people coming and going I don’t know why but I just stood there and watched Then my cell phone started to vibrate and I made myself move hoping it could fill in this hole in my heart You’re not alone You see, everybody We gotta hold each other up With much appreciation I send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts To the people who have always held me up Thank you for everything Thank you so much Wherever I may be I’ll always be grateful for who you are W-What is that! – Its a mountain – Its a whale! No, its a gatekeeper giant! Well, there you have it Kurosaki, you handle him – Go for it! – You can do it! Youre the man! Okay Huh ErrI guess I am!"

I-Im sorry So what Dont be so hard on her As it turned out, thanks to Inoue, we came through without a scratch You do not understand how serious this is I-Is this the Soul Society Yes This place is known as the Rukon District, the Drifting Spirit Town This is where souls first live upon coming to Soul Society, and is on the perimeter of Seireitei where Soul Reapers live Its the poorest place in Soul Society, but also the freest, and has the largest population of souls in Soul Society Hmm… But for all that, theres no one around here Huh Whats that It looks so different on that side Oh that… I got it! Thats where the Soul Reapers live… the Sei-whatever… Awright! Y-You fool! Dont get too close! Youll die! Huh Its been a long time… Huh since someone tried to pass through the Seirei Gate without a travel permit Youre a rare guest Welcome, kid! So the Ryoka have landed outside the Seirei Gate Since theyre on that side, theres no need for us to go Well… Especially since on that side… Jidanbo will be there Now come at me from anywhere… Kid! So huge! Who is he! Hes too big to be human! Just what is he His name is Jidanbo He was chosen from among the best in Soul Society to guard the White Road Gate, one of the four gates of Seirei Gate Guard Which means we have to beat him to get inside Yes But that wont be an easy task… In the 300 years that he has been on duty, no one has been able to break through the White Road Gate He is legendary for his power and strength So how do we fight a guy like that Thats where your intelligence comes in I think, first, a meeting is in order to come up with a strategy Hey Ichigo… Hey! Chad! Orihime! Come back! Come back, both of you! Ichigo, wait… Im coming to help! W-What is that! Hes crazy! I dont like your manners You must be country bumpkins Now listen up We have rules in the city First, wash your hands when you return from outside Two, dont eat food thats fallen on the floor Three, when you fight, its one-on-one My first opponent will be that kid… with the candy hair You wait here quietly, until Im done Inoue… Huh Ill wait for my chance and open up a hole in this wall The instant Im done, aim and shoot your Tsubaki at him through the hole What Are you still scheming something He has surprisingly sharp ears… Yeah Hey! Chad! Orihime! Ichigo! Are you all right Youre not hurt No, Im alive and kicking! Wait over there, were… About that, Orihime… Can you and Chad just stay put Huh Whatre you saying, Ichigo Thats…! Never mind Dont worry, just wait No, I refuse! Uryu! Our time is limited! Instead of just you, we have to attack together, and get going Oh, so youre there, Ishida Ive been here all the time! Quit saying irritating things at a time like this! Geez, will you all shut up Can you do it Umm… Probably Probably! Whatre you saying! Huh Do you understand the situation! Cripes… Look, dont worry How can I not worry! Ill tell you something interesting… My Soul Reaper strength was supposed to be restored in ten full days But I got it back in five So what do you think I did the remaining five days W-What were you doing Fighting For five days and nights, I fought that hat-and-clogs guy… one-on-one I get it… You learned the secrets of fighting… Nope… Huh He didnt teach me a thing But… Stamina and guts… I got em even if I didnt want em Are you done talking I dont remember asking you to wait You are a country bumpkin, after all You dont know your manners When someone waits for you… you say, thank you! Whats happening! What! Just what are you Isnt it bad manners to attack before your opponent is ready Whoa! H-Hes laughing Youre gutsy Good! Its been decades since someone stopped my thrust All right! This is great Today, I get to give it everything Ive got! Among those who tried to pass through here, there have been only three, including you, who were able to stop my first thrust However…not one has been able to stop…my second thrust!

Now its time for the finish! W-What…! W-Why…! Why are you…still standing! Hes standing! Kurosaki is still standing! Kurosaki! I get it! What Ichigo learned from that guy was not about stamina or guts… or even the secrets of fighting! Without a doubt, he has spiritual power beyond the norm of Soul Reapers… But hes still clumsy at wielding that power… What he lacked when he confronted other Soul Reapers… was experience! And once he got that, hes… Are you finished Hes…! Then its my turn Hes gonna be so strong, itll be scary! Not yet! Not yet! Im not…finished yet! Another axe! Try this! My final lethal attack! Jidanda Banzai Strike Festival! Sorry, but Im gonna destroy those axes W-What! That Kurosaki… Whatd he just do! That giant… went flying! Hah! Man, that was close! I slipped and fell on my butt!

Shut up! According to the map the Elder gave us, its supposed to be around here If you have any complaints, you take the lead! No, Im not complaining Kukaku Shiba probably wants to keep his identity a secret, thats why he lives in a place like this Unfortunately, that is not the case Its just that persons nature… and personal preference Dont worry This person moves around quite a bit, but the house is always built the same Once you see it, you’ll recognize it Once you see it, huh Yes, yes Just once… Oh, I see it! There it is Wha--! Whats this! Wow! How neat! Kukaku Shiba See You can recognize it at once Thats not the problem anymore! Wants to keep his identity a secret Thats probably a lie! Hes probably not allowed to live in town because he builds houses like that! Thats gotta be it! Hmm… So this time, its human arms holding the banner Its pretty neatly done Each time… He changes the motif Lets go Okay! Argh…were going to that embarrassing house right now! I dont want to be seen walking into a house like that! Whats the matter Hurry up! Yes Yes Hey Ishida! I know you dont want to go, but hurry up! Whats that supposed to mean Whats that chimney Its awfully big compared to the house It looks like the opening is closed up What the… Hold it! Huh Who goes there! Strangers! And one is a Soul Reaper!

What a pain this Soul Society is! Huh Huh Master Yoruichi! A descending stairway as soon as you enter This house really is weird I wonder how you get upstairs Please pardon us! We did not know it was you, Yoruichi, and your companions Please forgive our rudeness Were not his companions Thats all right Its my fault for not notifying you beforehand Thank you! Such generous words from such a great personage! Please wait here a moment Y-Yes! Yes, right away…Master Kukaku! Its been a while, Yoruichi K-Kukaku is… A woman! A woman! I never said it was a man Huh Who are those kids Actually, Kukaku… I have a favor to ask of you Thats usually the case when you look me up Is it a difficult problem Most likely Its been a long time since weve talked like this… All right Tell me, I love difficult things Can you see it, Rukia From that window over there The two tools which will be used for your execution That is the Sokyoku A prisoner who is held in this tower can look out the window that has been placed in the tower, and gaze out at the Sokyoku and repent his sins That is why this is called the Repentance Cell Your hands… Release! Thank you for transferring the prisoner here Let us go Yes Lieutenant Abarai… Huh Lieutenant! Here is unconfirmed information: You already heard that there were Ryoka in Soul Society yesterday Five of them… And one of them wielded a sword as long as his body A Soul Reaper with orange-colored hair Huh! I see… I get the picture All right, Ill take on the job Really Yeah If Urahara is involved, I cant refuse even if I wanted to However, while I trust you… I dont trust those kids Ill include my henchman to keep an eye on them Henchman Yeah Henchman, but hes actually my kid brother Hes still a brat and not that useful Hey, are you ready Oh…just a minute Im opening the door, so behave! Y-Yeah! How do you do! My name is Ganju Shiba! Please be good to me!

Huh Hey, its been awhile, Abarai Aizen-san! Can you talk Well… Its been quite some time since we talked like this Yes Since you were sent to Kenpachis place How many years has it been Youre with the Squad 6 now Err…what did you want to talk to me about Abarai, you and her… you were close to Rukia Kuchiki, right Dont deny it I heard you were chums from the old days in Rukon District Yes… I wont waste any time then In your eyes, should she die No… I dont understand your question Dont you think its strange Her crime was the unauthorized transfer, and loss, of her spiritual energy, and staying longer than allowed outside Certainly, heavy crimes, but the problem is how to deal with them The order for immediate return and disposal of her Gigai The lessening of the grace period from 35 days to 25 days, and the use of the Sokyoku on one who is ranked below a captain Theyre all outside the norm I have a feeling that this is the will of one person Hold it, Captain What do you mean! I have a bad feeling Abarai, I may… Attention all captains! Attention all captains! An urgent meeting will now be held! Repeat! Why you---! Hah! Serves you right! Lucky! What--! Why you--! Hows that!

With much appreciation send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts To the people who have always held me up Thank you for everything Thank you so much Wherever I may be I’ll always be grateful for who you are I was casually walking through town Around the time dusk fell and the city was bathed in red It was an afternoon with crowds of people coming and going I don’t know why but I just stood there and watched Then my cell phone started to vibrate and I made myself move hoping it could fill in this hole in my heart You’re not alone You see, everybody We gotta hold each other up With much appreciation I send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts To the people who have always held me up Thank you for everything Thank you so much Wherever I may be I’ll always be grateful for who you are This is the Special Hard Spiritual Partition Penetration Device which my sister invented that can break through the barrier which surrounds the entire Seireitei and which is made from the Sekki-Seki which breaks down spiritual energy completely Oh Can you repeat that Forget it!"

You may be a fireworks expert or whatever, but as if you could shoot us over with that--! What is this The Reishu-kaku, Spirit Core Place your palms on it and focus your spiritual energy! Huh Like this How do you focus your spiritual energy Huh What are you saying Like this! If youre a Soul Reaper, surely you know how to use your Kido Actually… Huh! This boy is the newbie Soul Reaper I told you about earlier He cant use Kido at all What! Like this Geez! How hopeless! Ganju, show him! Yes! Hey, give it here! Why you--! Kid! Wanna fight! Yeah… Take it if you can Id rather die than be shown by you! Cut it out! Sorry… Sorry… Huh W-Whats that! This is the Cannonball Cannonball Now listen up You think that the only thing guarding the Seireitei is that barrier, but youre wrong That barrier is made from an ore known as Sekki–Seki that is rare even in Soul Society This is a fragment of it As you can see, it completely breaks down spiritual energy Thats why its impossible to bore a hole through the barrier with spiritual energy On top of that… even when cut, it emits a wave that breaks down spiritual energy from all sides Which meansthat the Seireitai has a spherical barrier around it from the sky to the underground And so…that’s where this comes in! S-Sis…Im tired-- Deal with it! This is the Special Hard Spiritual Partition Penetration Device that I invented In other words, if all of you combined put your spiritual energy into this Spirit Core, you can create a temporary cannonball that will break through the barrier And then… Ill shoot that cannonball with the Flower-Crane Cannon and itll pierce straight through the barrier Any questions Err…well… All right, you are dismissed! Go to the underground training room and practice concentrating your spiritual energy! Yes, yes! Yes, yes! Take them! Yes! Yes! Let me go! What the hell! Dont touch me! Leggo! Put me down! Listen, if any one of you loses concentration, youll blow up right there! What! You all need practice! Practice hard! Hey, you never mentioned that!

Lieutenants are to put on their badges and wait in the aid’s room #2 This is getting interesting Abarai… Iba… Hinamori No one else showed up yet Yes, I think so Lieutenants are scattered all over Soul Society working diligently It might take about half a day for everyone to gather My Captain cant be reached at all What a pain Huh Who is your squad captain again You know, the Hitsugaya boy Oh, that little prodigy That’s tough Abarai… Huh Have you seen our Captain Aizen N-No, I havent Hes been acting strange lately Even this morning But he wont answer when I ask him if anythings wrong I dont know what to do Dont worry Huh Nothings the matter Even this summons will probably be cancelled soon Dammit!

She saved my life And I havent repaid her yet She gave me her power to save my family and me… even though she had just met me Because of that, she was arrested… and shes about to be executed I dont want to turn into a pathetic guy whod turn his back on her What Give it to me! Huh! Whatre you doing! Give it back! Im going to practice, too! Cover your ears! Dont you dare listen! Im going to review the trick I developed myself Huh Visualize this… Draw a circle in your heart… as dark as possible, and as heavy as possible Then…imagine yourself jumping right into the center of the circle This is the basic image that works for all Kido So easy Its so easy I could cry!

You make it sound like I let him go on purpose Thats precisely what Im saying Shut up, Kurotsuchi Im talking to him now Or do you want to be done in by me What did you say So stupid Oh boy… tempers are running high Enough of this!

Why you…! Just shut up and listen, Sis! My brother…was a genius He managed to pass the Soul Reaper  Academy entrance exam in one try At that time, his spiritual power was at Level 6 That’s the same level as a lieutenant of the 13 Court Guarding Squads Then, he finished six years’ curriculum in one, and he became a member of a Squad In just five years, he became a lieutenant But my brother was killed… betrayed by his Soul Reaper comrades! I was still a kid back then, so I don’t remember the details, but there are two things I’ll never forget Their faces…! Two faces! The ogre-like face of that Soul Reaper who dragged my badly injured and dying brother home And the face of my brother as he happily gave thanks to that Soul Reaper Why did my brother do that Why did he seem so happy To this day, I don’t know But there’s one thing I can say… My brother didn’t blame Soul Reapers He didn’t hate them I never knew he had such a painful experience Why! Why didn’t my brother despise Soul Reapers! Why did he continue to trust in the Soul Reapers You’re not like the other Soul Reapers I owe her… She saved my life And I haven’t repaid her yet I dont want to turn into a pitiful guy whod turn his back on her I have a feeling If I go with you, I might discover something That’s what I think That’s why I’m gonna help you I’ll go as far as I can, to see what a Soul Reaper is really like! Ganju… Y-You’re really something, Big Bro! Ganju… You’ve grown up fine! Humph! Looks like you’ve made up your mind Looks like I work with you Damn you… Everyone… are you ready for the Cannonball Yes!

Something like this is as simple as breathing in and out Wow! It took us so long to learn to do it! Do you resent it Do you resent that I could easily do something that gave you so much trouble to accomplish Huh Ganju Were you able to master it I guess… Then we’ll go with Flower-Crane Cannon Launch Method Two Can you handle it Sure! Don’t you chicken out and run off in the middle of it now, damn brat Sis… If you’re gonna go, you’ve got to put your life on the line Y-Yes! Are you ready! There’ll be no more delays, you brats! Now, get in there! The sun will be rising soon That will be the signal to begin the launching ceremony Listen… Once we’re in the Seireitei, we have to stick together If you encounter any Captains, don’t think, just run Our goal is to save Rukia, and nothing else Don’t, by any means, take any useless risks!

There wasn’t as much of a shock as I expected Idiot… It’s only the beginning Huh Huh What’s that It’s the next part! The Flower-Crane Cannon Launch Method Two involves two steps The First Spell controls everything from the launch to the directional setting The Secondary Spell then controls the acceleration and axis adjustment After that, you gradually improve the accuracy! Oh… Don’t get in the way if you want to get there safely Uh…Sure! There’s something I want to tell you all In order to enter the Seireitei, we have to stabilize this cannonball We must keep the spiritual energy output by each person at a constant level To do that, if you keep your hand on this thing, you’ll be able to see how much energy the others are releasing I want you to adjust your energy release accordingly Right Okay One mistake and it’ll be the end I’m counting on you!

Stop it, Ichigo! Ganju… This is no time to be doing that, is it She’s right Stop it! Stop it, I said! Stop it, both of you! Hey… Outside… It’s Seireitei! What’s that! Urgent alert! Urgent alert!

The warning certainly came… at a good time for you I don’t understand very well… what you’re trying to say You think you can get away with it You’d better not…take me too lightly W-What is that! I doubt it will be able to get through the Soul Shield Membrane… I’ll order everyone to draw back, just in case! I-It’s coming this way! Get out of here! We’re going to crash! We have no choice! Everyone, pour in all the spiritual energy you’ve got! It crashed! It ran into the Shield and stopped! To crash there and not be destroyed… Could it be a body of spiritual power of such great concentration Come on…! W-What’s going on! We got through the shield all right… but why aren’t we falling to the ground Don’t get separated! The Cannonball dissolved when it hit the shield and it’s only temporarily holding us up! That means… It will eventually create a whirlpool, then explode and vanish Oh! If we are separated at that time, we will be blown apart by the shock! Wha--! Ohh! It’s begun! Ohhh! Damn…! I’m not gonna get… blown away! Don’t come near me! Go away, if you don’t like it! Will you two cut it out! Grab onto whoever is nearest to you! Don’t let go, no matter what! Damn it! What do you mean by that! Let me sit on your shoulder Yoruichi! Ishida…! Chad…! Chad…! Chad…! Chad! C-Chad! Don’t worry He will surely survive! But if you want to be able to search for him down there, you must consider your own safety first! Damn it…! Ichigo…! Inoue…! Damn… They split up into four!

Oh Ishida… Are you all right, Ms Inoue… Oh… That’s right… It appears we were able to land, luckily, in an unpopulated area Huh How lucky! Owwww! Oh! Careful! You were injured in the fall I administered first-aid with the bandages I had, but I didn’t have any painkillers… S-So you did Thank you… You keep bandages on hand… Uh…oh, I’m fine! I’m sorry You were shielding me… If it weren’t for me, you would never have gotten hurt You think so I’m such a klutz, I would’ve gotten hurt, anyway And if you weren’t there with the first-aid kit, I would’ve bled, become anemic… and wouldn’t be able to move Does that sound weird No… Let’s just get going That was a pretty loud landing A crowd will be gathering soon Right… Luck, luck, luck, luck, luck, luck… Lucky! Luck, luck, luck… Lucky! Luck, luck, luck, luck Lucky-y! What’re you doing, fools! I was doing my “Lucky Dance” for you while waiting for you to come crawling out! What’re you gaping like idiots at! Dont you understand human kindness! Whats with him Hey! Huh What is it I’m gonna run first chance I get Courtesy is the basis… You’re gonna run Whatre you thinking! of the Samurai Code! Fool! Can’t you see! They have way greater spiritual powers… than ordinary Soul Reapers! What’s this arguing about! Hmph…maybe they’re scared out of their wits to fight us Well, let them take their time and argue But if they take too long, other guys will come and steal our glory Yeah, that’s true Fine! I’ll set a time limit! So kind! I’ll do another dance… Anyhow, Im gonna run! so you two can do what you want If you wanna fight, be my guest! Huh A disagreement Something like that Crap Don’t give us trouble Yumichika! Right! As I expected, one of them is after me! Damn! Yo! Huh Tell me… Why didn’t you run The other guy ran because he saw that our strength was greater than his, right I think he made the right decision If your strength is greater than mine, it’s useless to run You’d catch me for sure But…if my strength is greater… I’ll just defeat you and be on my way That’s all I see…I guess you’re not stupid, after all He dodged it! Moves well! With the sheath! At least…tell me your name Ichigo Kurosaki Ichigo… That’s a good name Think so No one ever praised it before Yeah Guys with “ichi” in their names are full of talent and good looks I’m 3rd-Seat Assistant Adjutant, Squad 11 Ikkaku Madarame! My fellow “ichi,” let’s be friends! No way! Dammit! He’s persistent! Won’t he ever stop! Humph… What ugly running Up ahead Turn into sand! Seppa! Hmm! What an unusual skill! That’s how you made that earlier crater But if you’re not careful… Seppa! Up ahead, there’s… W-What’s this! This is dangerous! This is the old execution ground We brought captive Hollows and threw them down here to fight criminals We would watch from up there Soul Reapers do crude things, don’t they… Not as crude as your face Pity you “Pretty” Even you recognize my dazzling handsomeness, don’t you Not “pretty”! I said, “Pity”! I know that! I made a witty, humorous joke! Besides, that “crude” practice no longer exists Only, those who fall in can never get out That should be enough chasing around and prattle for now It’s time I’ll let you choose Will you die…by my sword Or will you fall in that hole…and die Which will you choose Oops… If you’re angry, turn and let me see your face No matter how it looks… I love that look of agony when one must choose how to die You’re a crude bastard, after all, aren’t you… I don’t get it Hm Sure, we got a distance between us, but only a greenhorn would let one hand leave his sword during a match! S-Shut up! I can’t see with the blood in my eyes! I only wiped it! On the forehead, even a shallow wound bleeds profusely… Unless you stop the bleeding, it’s useless to wipe it Hey! That’s dirty! You have a styptic to stop the bleeding! It’s not dirty! It’s brains! Brains! You should admire me for being experienced! Yeah Hah! You sure are a strange guy… You behave like a greenhorn And you don’t look much like a fighter But… You have excellent reflexes! And fierce attack! You could even say your movements are coming close to mine! Don’t look so angry I’m praising you You’re too good to be dismissed as a mere greenhorn with natural abilities… Who was your teacher, Ichigo It was only for ten days, so I don’t know if I can call him “Teacher,” but there is a man who taught me how to fight Who Kisuke…Urahara I see… He was your teacher… In that case, it would be rude to kill you without giving my all Lengthen! Hozuki-maru! A spear! No time to look surprised, Ichigo! I’m coming at ya! Don’t misread this! Not me! Heh! A spear’s reach is long I know that much! I won’t misread it! Wrong! An opening! Split apart! Hozuki-maru! Now…look this way Show me your expression in your last moment of life Each time I see such things, my beauty grows even keener Get beautiful without my help! You wretch! Turn into sand! Seppa! What are you doing! To beautiful me…! Oh, no! I’m falling, falling! Falling! Disgraceful Talk about digging your own grave I guess some actually do it How trifling Huh! Gotcha A strange trick…! What is that orb! Heh… Good thing I brought a spare… This is a Cannonball developed by Shiba Kukaku, the best sis in the world Not even a Zanpaku-to can easily shatter it Oh, my How he underestimates me… I am 5th Seat of Squad 11, the strongest Squad Don’t think I’m any ordinary Soul Reaper…! Bloom! Fuji Kujaku! I’ll break that spiritual partition with a single blow! Oh yeah… I forgot to tell you, this bomb of my Sis’s… Once its concentration of spiritual power is broken, it quickly… You sneaky…! Clever strategy, wasn’t it… Still… You are a tough bastard! Don’t tell me you thought that was enough to kill me off Now I’m really mad! You’ll pay…! Can’t hear you Seppa! Running again! Kiss my butt Ugly… Too ugly…! I warned you not to misread it Hozuki-maru isn’t a spear It’s a “sansetsukon” Does it hurt That hand probably can’t hold a sword anymore I’m a kind-hearted guy Ordinarilly, I would’ve taken you in alive Sorry, though I get no recognition unless I kill you Fine! What’re you doing Let’s go! Don’t talk as if it’s over I still haven’t shown you my skill It starts now, Ikkaku Fine words Greenhorn!  I looked up into the night sky and saw a comet I want to see you right now, but I cant fly If I could become a comet I would fly across the sky… Im sure I would circle the skies and shine over you With this instantaneous light that will definitely reach you If I could become a comet Im sure Ill alway stay close to you Now and forever  You’re pretty good, Ichigo But the real battle starts now It’s too late to come crying with apologies! That’s my line! Fight! Hit it, Cover it, Rock Scissors Paper! Not that kind of battle!"

That way, then! Go back, go back! Are you sure we can trust this intuition of yours Uh! Ms Inoue! Hide! Found them! Where’d they go… It looks like we really caused a big commotion It’ll be difficult to meet up with Kurosaki and the others before searching for Ms Kuchiki If there was a commotion someplace, we’d find one of them there Perhaps we should just jump in… Or… What do you think, Ms Inoue Huh Ms Inoue W-Where’d she go Ishida-a-a! Huh! What happened, anyway! Sorry! I went scouting, and they spotted me! Since they’ve seen us, I’ll have to fight! I’ll fight, too! No! Leave this to me! They stopped! Get them!

Bastard! Give it back…! I’m not gonna take it I just used some of the medicine in it to stop the bleeding But I used it all up on the both of us But it sure works great, this medicine…! B-Bastard! That was dirty! Why! Sure, I used it up, but that’s no reason to get so mad That’s not it! Damn…! I knew something was wrong! I didn’t die, even after losing so much blood…! I can’t live on like this…in shame Damn! If I could only move, I’d beat you to a pulp!

Running again! I’m running! Kuchiki Yeah That Kyokushu What do you guys want with somebody like her We came to save her Haah! S-Save her… How many of you came! At least 7 or 8, right No… Five humans and one animal What One animal… You seriously intend to rescue her with so few! That’s right! Y-You’ll never pull off something like that! Are you stupid, or something! I-I laughed so hard, my wound opened up! I dunno who’s the stupid one Ahh Well, all right… Directly south from here are the stations for each of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads… H-Huh You’re going to tell me Shut up! Just listen! Or I won’t tell you! At the west end of the stations is a white tower She should be there… I-Is that true You’re doubting me! I have no interest in whatever you want with the girl Save her, if that’s what you want Hey, get going, or other Reapers will find you! Go, if you’re going! Oh…yeah… So long I owe you, Ikkaku Don’t It’s annoying Wait a minute Can I ask you something Who’s the strongest in your group It’s me, probably… Is that so… Watch out for my captain, then Captain has no interest in weak men If what you say is true, you’re the one he’ll be after! He’s strong Meet him, and you’ll find out… how strong he is That is, if you stay alive long enough when you meet What’s his name…! Captain of the Squad 11, Kenpachi Zaraki Crap Another dead end! You were the first in pursuit You have no sense of direction! Fool! We’re stuck because I trusted in your so-called “intuition”! Never mind! Let’s move on Aye, aye, sir! I looked up into the night sky and saw a comet I want to see you right now, but I cant fly If I could become a comet I would fly across the sky… Im sure I would circle the skies and shine over you With this instantaneous light that will definitely reach you If I could become a comet Im sure Ill alway stay close to you Now and forever No sense of fashion!

Would you like to try I didn’t tell you, but… the bottom of the hole is surrounded by Sekki-Seki In other words, they completely block spiritual powers Now you know, don’t you Why no one who falls in can ever get out again Ow…! I see the damage I inflicted is still there, after all… Well, you’ve managed to elude me all this time, even though wounded I suppose I should commend you for coming so far, as ugly as you are You really make me sick!

Our Squad 11 is the best combat unit of the 13 Court Guard Squads! Ikkaku is our 3rd best fighter! How could your man defeat him! Your only strong skill is seeing openings! You ain’t seen nothing yet! Shiba-Style… Battle-Level Shooting Flower! Senpen Banka! Don’t underestimate me! You call that a skill! How dare you… My face, how dare you…! Now you look more like a man! No finesse You probably mean to use your one strange skill to collapse the ground, and kill us both Huh! Me, die with you I’d never die so wastefully! Silence! You’re a tough bastard For all this time you’ve run from me, enduring my attacks, and yet you still can move I marvel at your physical strength Just a while longer… Just a little while longer… He still underestimates my power The only time to use the Seppa is now, while his guard is down! Truly… That alone is regrettable If you had been born beautiful… You would have been my very favorite I can’t dodge him! What’s wrong Can’t you use that floating technique anymore Ugly… What good is it for an ugly one to persist in living If one is born ugly, he should at least die beautifully I disagree It seems our ideas of aesthetics are completely different I was taught that, ugly or not, the one who survives is the finest! What! Bastard! You dare lay your ugly hand on my head…! It helped that you underestimated me to the last Now for the finish! Shiba-Style Rock-Wave Secret Move! Renkan Seppa Sen! W-What the…! Dammit! You can’t finish me with this puny attack! Don’t make me laugh! Where are you! Where! H-Hey! Take this! What’s this… It’s a bomb! Noo!

But… it’s not this way, is it Since it’s a dead end Shouldn’t we have turned right at the last corner You’re the one who said to come this way! Oh, Kenny! You shouldn’t blame others! Wasn’t I close There, go there! This way, right Yep! They’re gone, aren’t they Yes… He seemed terribly strong It’s lucky that he didn’t see us, isn’t it Yes He must be the same type as Kurosaki He has awesome power, but poor detection abilities Now… We changed sites, but where should we go from here How about that way I see a tower off in the distance… Tower Where Look, over there Didn’t touch her… To escape from such close range… very good Magnificent! If you had met anyone but me, you might have lived a little longer Lament! I’ll count to ten to give you time to lament One… I sense the collision of Spirit Pressure here and there Don’t die, my friends Live! One… Two… Oh…thank you I’m all right, Ishida Three… Four… Yes…you are Five… He’s not the same Ishida as a while ago Six… He moved so quickly Seven… For a split second, Ishida vanished from my consciousness… then I was saved before I realized Such a transformation at the mere sight of a Soul Reaper It’s just as Yoruichi said Ishida is a Quincy Even now, Soul Reapers are enemies to him Ten! Now, your time for lamentation is over Have you done it to your satisfaction He’s coming! Right! Now comes another time for lamentation Come, Soul Reaper! I’m the one you’ll fight! It is not you who decides who will fight! Now, I shall end your lamentation With your death… Ms Inoue! Run! No, I mustn’t run I’ve got to fight and save Kurosaki! Tsubaki! At last, it’s show time Aim well! Koten Zanshun! I reject! Tsubaki! Fool… Faltering like that…! Tsubaki… That was the first time I saw that technique There’s no intent to kill in your attack Though you might kill Hollows with that move, it will have no effect on Soul Reapers M-My body won’t move… This is a battleground! Without the intent to kill, you’ll never stop anyone! Wha--! So you want an attack with intent to kill Then fight me It’s here in my bow… The intent to kill you love so much Hanataro…! What do you want This is no place for your kind! Be gone! We never sent for anyone from Squad 4! Uh…I used to do the cleaning when she was in Squad 6 barracks’ prison I thought the Shishinro might need some cleaning, too… The Shishinro can’t be opened for anyone until the sentence is carried out! Don’t you even know that! Beat it, beat it! Oh, but… Beat it, or I’ll hack you to pieces! Y-Yes, sir… What’s wrong! Scared You can’t get away, Ryoka! You’ll get us a special promotion! Rats!

That was a fluke! Don’t be so cocky You still don’t understand Sorry, but if you’re supposed to be the strongest, I take back your nickname as of today Where flying weapons are concerned, I seem to be the better man The name, “Uryu Weasel with Scythe,” though, doesn’t sound all too cool You men search over there If you find them, take them alive They might make interesting research specimens Don’t let the other Squads capture them first Yes, sir! Go! Hmph! They’re only humans, though I don’t expect very good specimens Hell Butterfly What’s the message, Nemu Yes, sir… Ikkaku Madarame of Squad 11 encountered and fought a Ryoka What! So the Squad 11 already has a Ryoka No, Ikkaku was beaten by the Ryoka and taken to the Squad 4 General Relief Station The Ryoka escaped and his whereabouts remain unknown Defeated by a Ryoka My my… Among the Ryoka, there seem to be quite interesting subjects Where’s Zaraki Searching for Ryoka, sir Then he wouldn’t know about this yet Well, before he gets wind of it, let’s get the info on Ryoka Lord Mayuri, where are you going To see Ikkaku How slow you are to guess Come along, dullard I sense Zaraki’s Spiritual Pressure So he’s on the move… Ichigo… Be careful! Get him! There! I looked up into the night sky and saw a comet I want to see you right now, but I cant fly If I could become a comet I would fly across the sky… Im sure I would circle the skies and shine over you With this instantaneous light that will definitely reach you If I could become a comet Im sure Ill alway stay close to you Now and forever Were surrounded! So many Soul Reapers! Weve got to fnd someplace to hide! We need a plan to outwit the enemy! Just blast them with an attack right through the middle! Okay, you go You go You go Go, Ganju!

Since you couldn’t beat me, you thought you could at least get Orihime Or were you planning to take her hostage H-How did you know I don’t like bullying the weak… But I don’t mind exposing cowards From the moment you showed up, you were targeting her, not me Most would find it beneath themselves to attack a lady when she’s not looking An honorable person with any decent pride wouldn’t do such a thing; that’s a coward’s way of fighting Amazing And good-bye You don’t even deserve the time to lament Thank you, Uryu I-It’s okay, you don’t need to thank me I… “Didn’t really do much” Did he die No… I shot out the Soul Chain and Hakusui - Soul Sleep, vital spots that control the generation of the spiritual energy He’s not dead However, he’ll lose his spirit powers And once he awakes, he’ll no longer return to being a Soul Reaper As a result of this battle… that’s sufficient Shall we go Uh-huh I’ve heard from Yoruichi, “A Quincy gathers the spiritual particles around them to fight” I’m sure he uses that glove to increase his ability to gather spiritual particles Because of its overwhelming power, in order to avoid harming us, Uryu was training by himself And he was able to master it to that degree… In just ten days, all by himself You’re incredible, Uryu What have I done in those ten days Oops! T-Thank you Yeah This isn’t… Orihime! Hang in there, Orihime! That’s right – I promised! Orihime! Huh A-Are you all right Did you get hurt earlier Ah, oh no! I’m sorry, it’s nothing! I just got teary-eyed looking at the sun Don’t you get that sometimes You know, like sneezing Or wanting to go to the restroom when you’re at the bookstore, or your gums bleeding when you bite into an apple Well, let’s go, Uryu! I’m going to do my best too! Orihime… What Are you sure you’re all right Huh How come Well… Why am I the only one getting chased around over and over! Hey stop, you side burned monkey! Stop squirming, you lower eyelash! You with that ugly face! W-What did you say! That other guy was kind of good-looking, but no matter how I look at it, you have no place to comment on my looks! What did you say! We’re going to eat you, Ugly! With this many on my tail, I can’t even win an argument! Oh! Ichigo! Reinforcements! Just in time… Or not! He—y, Ganju—! W-Wait minute! Why are you getting chased around too It makes no sense to get together! Idiot! Stop waving at me! You’re riling up the guys running behind you! I said don’t come this way… Let’s go, Ganju! Duck! This is Iemura Squad 4, Unohana Relief Crew, Groups 1, 6 and 14 are approaching enemy position Let’s hustle! This is not a drill! Yes, sir! That was dangerous, you fool! Why’d you swing that blade out of the blue like that! Are you crazy! What I told you to duck, didn’t I ! The problem is that the time between warning me and doing it was too short, too fast! Well, you should have reacted right away! Like I could have, you moron! Let’s see… So, now what We got away with a surprise attack just now, but just ‘cause we showed them some muscle… These guys don’t look like the type to back off Damn I’m totally late What should I do… Should I go back But if Mr Iemura asks, “Where’d you go” it’ll be hard to answer Oh, but if I don’t go, he’ll get even angrier… Anyway, where did everyone go I wonder… Oh yeah! I’ll ask those people up ahead! Ah, umm… Excuse me, I’m from the Squad…4… W-What are you doing, twerp! Excuse me! Damn it, stay away! Who the heck are you E-Excuse me! What’s the commotion Hmm Huh O-Ouch… That was terrible… Ichigo… I’ve got an easy plan to get us out of here What a coincidence Me too A-Ah… A plan to get out of here Ah, umm…c-could it be… that you two are the…alleged…Ryoka! Hey! Open up a path, you punks! If you punks value your friend’s life! No way! It’s them! Aren’t we there yet, Yachiru! Is it really this way I’m sure, I’m sure I’m positive it’s this way… I think “I think Did you just say “I think” Oh, be quiet Then, this way! “Then” Did you just say “then” Why are you always complaining You decide then! I don’t care anymore! Ugh… This way, right Yup, yup, this way, this way! You’re positive You’re absolutely positive, right Hey! Open up a path, you punks! If you punks value your friend’s life! No, let me go! Let me… W-What’s with this vibe Maybe they didn’t hear us… Wanna try again O-Okay Hey Open up a path, you punks! If you punks value your friend’s life! Hey! Uh, y-yes… What… are you jerks doing Huh Well, umm, taking a hostage And he looks like our friend You’re not I-I’m from the Squad 4 These guys are from Squad 11 So, what’s the difference Heh, I guess it’s true these Ryoka are outsiders I don’t want you to lump us together, so I’ll tell you Clean out your ear holes and listen carefully! There are a total of 13 Guard Squads that protect the Seireitei We, the Squad 11, are lead by the strongest of the 13 captains As such, we are the strongest in battle of the 13! Oh! Now that you mention it, these guys all have weird hairstyles, but yours is normal T-Thanks So, you’re from where I-I’m from the Squad 4 The Squad 4 is the rear echelon that specializes in relief and aid Ouwie, ouwie, go away! A bunch of wimps that can’t even wield a sword properly Yay, he’s all better! They’re the weakling pansies of the 13 squads Oh boy, it’s heavy… To be honest, I don’t know why they even exist Hip, hip, hooray! We can’t stand them! They annoy us! Therefore, we, the Squad 11… Hate the Squad 4! So if you want to kill him, go ahead! You’ll be doing us a favor! Nooo—! W-W-Wait a minute! Isn’t it too cruel to say you don’t care what happens to him just because you don’t like him Huh, you guys! Wow, that’s a rational argument Let’s go! Go get them! Damn, I guess we’re going to have to muscle our way out of here Huh! W-What was that I-I don’t know… Anyway! I’m certain that it halved our enemy, so this is our chance now! Oryah! Move it, move it! I thought I sensed Ichigo’s Spiritual Pressure… I must have missed him Hey, you there! Did you just do that, you jerk! What’s with the weird get-up Are you a friend of those guys from earlier Guys Earlier Probably, yeah Great! You think you can mock the Squad 11 and get out of here alive We’ll crush you in five minutes! Sorry, but I can’t accommodate your wishes… Huh What did you say It won’t take five minutes I’ll be done in two minutes Fourth Squad - General Relief Station So, you’re not going to say anything no matter what Ikkaku Madarame… Why don’t you say something Please sir! Mr Captain of Squad 12! Such interrogation is prohibited on these premises Shut up! Sir Mayuri… You be quiet too, Nemu! Just shut up, okay Do you want to be pulled to pieces again No, sir Forgive me It’s not that I don’t want to say… I really don’t know I don’t know the Ryoka’s objective, destination or anything, for that matter Then, what So you’re saying that although you’ve met and fought these Ryoka, you were just defeated in battle and retreated like a dog without gaining any information Is that it Exactly Furthermore… I have not seen the enemy’s face, nor heard his voice So, I have not a shred of information to give to you Fine… Then you shall receive a punishment… befitting your failure Right! I’m surprised Since when did you get so powerful that you can punish those of other squads… Kurotsuchi Zaraki…! Humph, well, if his captain is here, then there’s no need for me to interrogate him I’ll withdraw for now Let’s go, Nemu! Stop stalling, you dullard Yes, sir Captain… You got yourself pretty beat up there, huh Are you here just to visit me Nope, we got lost on our way! Oh, the Lieutenant is here too It’s by coincidence that we wound up here, but we were worried about you Are you okay, Baldy I told you not to call me that, you brat! Then, Shiny Baldy You heard me, didn’t you Shiny, Shiny Baldy! I heard…that you lost My deepest apologies I’ve come back despite the shame of my defeat Is he strong Yes, indeed He appears to be a Soul Reaper He wears a Shihakusho, short orange hair, with a body-length sword without a guard or grip He is headed towards Senzaikyu Shishinro That maximum-security prison I gave him your description, and told him to be on the lookout for you If he heeded my words… you will surely enjoy an excellent battle, regardless of where you meet him He’s strong, and I fear that strength is still growing By the time he meets up with you, he will probably be stronger still I see… And his name is… I’m Hanataro Yamada It’s hard to remember! Really Everyone tells me it’s an easy name to remember! Oh, yeah I get “Taro Yamada” or “Hanako Yamada,” but “Hanataro” is so hard to remember, hard Gosh… Besides, aren’t you our enemy Huh Why are you so laid back and introducing yourself Ah, I guess so Now that you’ve mentioned it… Why did we bring this guy with us Couldn’t help it He was nearby, so I accidentally carried him with us! Accidentally! What do you mean, accidentally Do you pick up whatever is lying on the ground Shut up! You didn’t notice him yourself until just now! P-Please, you two Stop fighting over me! Who’s fighting over you! But, if you raise your voices, someone might find us! Are we all right It seems so But still, if it’s true what that bald guy said, and even if Rukia is in that white tower, Oh! the problem is which road to take to get there Oh, that’s right I have a map We wouldn’t want to run into any Captains along the way, huh If we only knew the enemy’s positions… By the way… There are no roads on this map… What Huh What’s this Peace! Did you draw this yourself What It’s better than having nothing Umm… Shut up, we’re in the middle of strategizing Don’t butt in Actually, you can go home already You’re not going to be of much use anyway I swear… Rukia… Are you talking about Rukia Kuchiki Just as I thought… It’s her, isn’t it The younger sister of the Captain of Squad 6, currently held in maximum security… Then that “white tower” you referred to is the Senzaikyu I… I know the hidden way into that tower Kenny, you seem pretty happy Huh Are you talking about me Yup! I haven’t seen you this happy in a while Is that so You might be right… He survived against Ichimaru He defeated Ikkaku And, Ikkaku said he was strong Ikkaku said he would become stronger still! Where Where are you I, Kenpachi Zaraki, am waiting for you! Come out! Ichigo Kurosaki! I looked up into the night sky and saw a comet I want to see you right now, but I cant fly If I could become a comet I would fly across the sky… Im sure I would circle the skies and shine over you With this instantaneous light that will definitely reach you If I could become a comet Im sure Ill always stay close to you Now and forever Yo, hows everyone doing This is everyones idol, Kon! Why isnt it my turn yet Ive been ready and waiting over here! Hey, are you listening to me If you make too much of a fuss, you may never get your turn Oh, yes I will always be waiting, so please be nice to this stuffed doll"

Oh, that’s right I have a map We wouldn’t want to run into any Captains along the way, huh Rukia… Are you talking about Rukia Kuchiki Huh! Just as I thought… It’s her, isn’t it Then that “white tower” you referred to is the Senzaikyu I…know the hidden way into that tower Huh, I would have never thought of using the sewer system Yes, this sewer system runs underground throughout the Seireitei, so we can go anywhere without running into obstacles Don’t the others know about this entrance It was under an ordinary-looking tile… Yes, everyone knows about it, but I doubt they’ll catch up with us down here Why’s that The only ones that fully comprehend this complex system are members of Squad 4, those of us who specialize in relief and aid Oh, I see, this system is also used as a pathway for relief and aid That’s why only the relief and aid company needed to master this system Not exactly… It’s just that it’s Squad 4’s duty to clean up the sewer system We’re weak, so… we wind up with a lot of menial chores Gee, I kind of feel sorry for this Squad 4 No… It’s really not all that bad Hanataro Huh Why are you doing all this for us We’re your enemies And just because we want to go to the White Tower… Hey, Ichigo Why are you guiding us without question I know a lot about you… from listening to Rukia Ichigo Kurosaki… Please… Save Rukia! Here is the situation report Sir Ikkaku Madarame, Third Seat of Squad 11, and Sir Yumichika Ayasegawa, Fifth Seat, same squad… The above high-ranking Seat officers, due to serious injuries, will withdraw from the front lines A detailed damage report for the individual squads is still pending investigation However, regarding Squad 11… There is a report stating that they were nearly annihilated Squad 11! No way… In just a few hours since entering this realm, they’ve managed to wreak that much havoc Hah, how pathetic At this time, there are three confirmed Ryoka, of which two have taken a member of the Squad 4 hostage We have intelligence indicating that these two, with the hostage, are headed this way However, since a while ago, we have been unable to detect their Spiritual Pressure, therefore, their whereabouts are unknown Either way, we need to collect more information Frankly, it’s been a while since our Fourth Seat reported in I think he’s been defeated too Can you check in on the West 20 area The Fourth Seat of Squad 7… You mean Jirobo – the Kamaitachi Yeah Jidanbo’s brother, huh He’s defeated too What in the world is going on Gosh, they’re all pathetic This certainly has turned into a horrible mess, Abarai… We need to act more carefully That Squad 11 gets too temperamental You, stop spreading misinformation Abarai… I did no such thing… Rangiku, calm down Before Rukia was captured and placed in the Senzaikyu Shishinro, she was held in Squad 6’s barracks I was assigned to cleaning duty for that area To be honest, I was scared of her at first After all, she is nobility But… But Rukia scolded me on my first day Umm, Miss Rukia, I’ll be starting today’s cleaning chores now I’d rather you not call me that Umm… But… Just address me normally Uh  Umm… Ah… Then… Rukia Thank you… Y-Yes! Her voice was much kinder than what I had expected I was quite relieved Ever since that day, my daily cleaning at the barracks gradually has become something to look forward to And little by little, Rukia started telling me all kinds of things Umm, Rukia I don’t know much about the human world, but what’s it like over there Like the things to eat or drink… Oh, I’m sorry! I mean, it’s nothing! I’m sorry They have a beverage called a “juice” that comes in a paper package What kind of a drink is that It is a difficult beverage… Huh! There is a trick to drinking it Even I had difficulties with it Is that so There’s a drink that even you had difficulties with… Hanataro, you may not be able to drink it even after hearing the trick Really! That guy, he taught me how to drink it Rukia, was there anything unusual in the human world Did you know that a Mod Konpaku can be inserted into inanimate objects as well What! You mean those illegal things There was this guy who placed one into a stuffed doll found on the street Stuffed doll That’s the thing made with cotton and such, right To put it into something like that… There sure are some reckless folks out there… Yes… There are some reckless ones out there Of all the tales Rukia told me of the human world… the majority of them were always about this one person Shortly thereafter, an official execution order was sent to Rukia Don’t make me repeat myself For a first-degree offense, Rukia Kuchiki shall be held in maximum security In 25 days, she shall be sent to the Central Execution Grounds to be executed Rukia… The person you gave your Soul Reaper powers to… Is that the same person you often speak of His name is Ichigo Kurosaki I only spent two months with him, but strangely, I felt I could trust him from the bottom of my heart And yet… And yet… Because of me, his destiny became twisted and he was terribly hurt There is nothing I can do to atone for this… She looked very sad as she said that How’d you say She’s a strange Soul Reaper, that one… Yeah, she’s a strange one Huh That’s why we’re here to rescue her Ah Hey! W-Wait a minute! Did I say something wrong How should I know! Hey, Ichigo! I only spent two months with him… but strangely, I felt I could trust him from the bottom of my heart And yet, because of me, his destiny became twisted and he was terribly hurt There is nothing I can do to atone for this… That idiot! Isn’t that all my fault! I swear, I won’t let you die Rukia! Uh… It’s okay! You can come up This exit is the closest to the tower Wow! It seems like a long time since I’ve breathed fresh air! There, that’s the Senzaikyu! We’re definitely closer to it, but look at that! It looks like it’s going to be a rough road ahead The mist is clearing! Let’s hurry Hmm Is something the matter, Ichigo There’s someone by the stairs It’s been a while Do you remember my face I would have liked to forget it, but there’s still a mountain of payback I owe you… Renji Abarai! That’s a surprise, you remembered my name, too That’s pretty good Why, thank you W-Who is this guy His Spirit Pressure is on a completely different level than those earlier guys T-That, that person is… Renji Abarai! The Lieutenant of Squad 6! Lieutenant I’m truly surprised… I thought you’d be dead after Captain Kuchiki’s attack Ah, hey! Wait a minute, Ichigo! I don’t know how you managed to survive, but you’re something else, all right But this is as far as you go As I’ve told you before, I will kill the one who stole Rukia’s powers As long as you’re alive, Rukia can’t get her powers back! How can you say that after taking her back just to kill her! I’m coming through! Try it if you can! If only you can defeat me! It’s starting, and the opponent is Abarai, huh He’s already defeated the Third Seat Next, he had better defeat at least a Lieutenant Otherwise, he won’t be much fun as my opponent Kenny, how is it that you don’t sense other people’s Spirit Pressure, but you can tell they’re fighting from far away That’s because I’m strong Hmm… That’s weird Hey, have you found anything No, not at all It’s been a while since these Ryoka crossed over and while our casualties keep rising, we can’t seem to find them at all! It means that they’re that crafty The Captains and Lieutenants are keeping in close contact to obtain the latest status report details Hey! In that direction… They found Jirobo of the Squad 7 fallen! What! They’re gone… Uh-huh It seems Ichigo and the others are doing quite a number out there The security is getting tighter Well, I think we can handle those Soul Reapers now… What’s the matter, Uryu This Spirit Pressure… It’s Ichigo, and the other one is… Renji Abarai! Ichigo… You sure met up with a tough one… Huh Hey, are you okay Do you feel fine Are you running a fever I’m okay, so don’t worry about me That’s good to hear You space out sometimes, so I was worried Aw, that was no fun See you later! Good, then let’s hurry! Ichigo’s spiritual power is rising… His opponent’s Spirit Pressure is quite strong… I had better hurry Ichigo, you’re fighting against a Lieutenant! No matter how strong you are, you can’t win! No… That may not be the case Please take a good look at Ichigo Incredible! He’s completely overpowering Lieutenant Abarai! He… Ichigo… What exactly is he That’s what I’d like to know Hey, Ichigo Kurosaki… How do you plan on saving Rukia How Even if you defeat me here, there are still 11 Lieutenants left And above them, there are 13 Captains Unless you defeat them all, there’s no way to save Rukia And you think you can do that Of course! Who cares how many Captains there are Or how many Lieutenants It doesn’t matter! I’ll defeat them! I’ll defeat them all if they get in my way! What’s that Where do you get your confidence from Why are you so worked up over this Your Zanpaku-to has changed, huh Don’t think you’re stronger just because of that! Don’t get cocky! Huh! Roar! Zabimaru! I-I can’t stop it! Yikes! Ichigo! I-Ichigo… You seem to think… that you already know my strength just by fighting me once Let me tell you something When the ranked Lieutenants and above are sent outside, our powers are severely limited so that we don’t adversely affect the human world My strength right now is five times greater than before So no matter how strong you become, there’s no way you can defeat me! So that means that attack there… was the best you’ve got Didn’t affect me! Not at all! Thank you! If 11 of these are what I’m dealing with, I think I can handle it! The idiot! I looked up into the night sky and saw a comet I want to see you right now, but I cant fly If I could become a comet I would fly across the sky… Im sure I would circle the skies and shine over you With this instantaneous light that will definitely reach you If I could become a comet Im sure Ill always stay close to you Now and forever As I’ve said before, we Soul Reapers have our powers severely limited in the human world My strength right now is five times greater than it was when I last fought you! I’ve been training and I’ve become ten times stronger than before! Then I’m a hundred times stronger than that! I’m a thousand times stronger than that! Actually, I’m ten thousand times stronger! Then I’m a hundred thousand times stronger than that! I’m a million times stronger in addition to that! Well, too bad, I’m plus ten million times stronger! Then I’m a hundred million times stronger! I’m infinite times stronger!"

You talk big, but it seems standing is about all you can do Its over! If you didnt exist… If she didnt meet you… Rukia wouldnt… have to go through all this! Oh! Get away, Ichigo! I wont let you get away! Ichigo! Its impossible… Its impossible, after all Taking on a Lieutenant… Kira…this… Its Abarais Lieutenant insignia He disappeared in the middle of the meeting I was worried, so I went to the Squad 6 barracks… and this is what I found… in front of his room Are the Captains aware of this I havent told them I see I thought about telling Captain Aizen, but I didnt want Abarai getting punished because of that Until we know whats going on, that was wise of you Kira, what could this mean To remove this before he left… It must be very important Abarais been mulling over the Kuchiki case a lot In any case, Ill look for him, too Stubborn bastard You want to save Rukia that badly Idiot! Not “want” “Will”! Quit messing with me! Rukias crime became more serious because you stole her powers! Do you understand Its YOUR fault! Its your fault that Rukia will be killed! I know that! Thats why I… will save her! I finally see it His limit is three attacks Now listen up… For anything that can be called an attack, the stronger the attack, the more limitation will be put upon the number of the attacks Limitation Indeed Just like a gun can only be fired six times A missile only once Repetitive attacks are always limited to certain numbers Which means… when he extends his Zabimaru is one And after that, he uses it extended twice And… After the third thrust… his Zabimaru will return to its original state Lets test it It doesnt have to be the same number each time Whats crucial is the maximum number of attacks When a battle is intense… the enemy will always use the maximum number of attacks You bastard! One! If you can figure out what that maximum number is, that will be your chance Two! The most important thing is… the last of his repeated attacks The moment before the repetitive attacks start again Three! Damn! At that moment, your enemy will be completely open This is the end, Renji! I told you, you cannot defeat me! He countered me! Why You look shocked that I countered your attack Looking for an opening between thrusts is good And your timing was perfect So… Why werent you able to beat me Theres one answer You are slower than me You cant overcome the difference in our power Its as simple as that Understand You cannot save Rukia Ichigo! That terrific Spiritual Pressure just now… I hope Ichigo is all right Abarais Spiritual Pressure… Huh This Spiritual Pressure is… Follow me! I-Ichigo…! Hes alive… Ichigo is alive! Damn right! He dodged the blow You are truly stubborn Why you…! You really tried to kill me just now! Of course! I’m now driving you to the corner Ill keep pushing you and pushing you So that you can use it anytime, anywhere This attack Dont be ridiculous! That was a fluke No way can I keep using it whenever I want You have to use it whenever you want Now listen, you have just begun to summon your true Zanpaku-to and learn to fight You have potential But right now, youre only at the level of a Third or Fourth Seat In order to stay even with a Lieutenant or higher, youll have to be able to use it at will Easier said than done… It took everything outta me then and I dont remember much about when I did that I know that Thats why Thats why… Why you--! Yes, Ill keep pushing you… so that you can remember… that attack! The target has hit the rocks Healing Squad dispatching! Dammit! Hes pitiful! Whats the matter, boss Not yet Dammit! At this rate, Ill really… Im disappointed, Kurosaki Im so disappointed Your sword exhibits only fear When you counter, its because you fear being killed When you attack, you fear killing And when you try to protect someone, you fear letting them die Yes The only thing your sword speaks of, is dumb fear And thats not it What you need in battle is not fear Nothing will come of that When you counter, you dont let them cut you If you protect someone, you dont let them die When you attack, you kill See Cant you see The reflection on my sword… is sheer resolve to kill you Thatll do His Zanpaku-to… Its howling Theyre crying out They cant wait to cross swords See, youve got it…resolve I-Ichigo… He intends to continue fighting But hes different Hes totally different from before Sorry to keep you waiting, Renji I’ve got resolve This time, I WILL get you! Whats with him All of a sudden… Was it like that last time No, its different That time, he was just exuding spiritual energy at random This time… its calmly controlled And without a doubt… its much stronger When you counter, you dont let them cut you Why you--! When you protect someone… you dont let them die When you attack…you kill! Why you--! He did it! He got me… What was that just now Zabimaru… Damn it! I’ve got resolve Resolve… It hurts My body feels heavy My legs… wont move My arms… wont rise Damn it… Have I lost Damn… Dammit…!

See But its something, aint it That brat is going to become Mr Soul Reaper Hes going to be the pride of this town I want to be one, too In your dreams!

What did you do that for Before we realized it, we were together, always together We were a family But…this was still a dirty town with dirty people living dirty lives The grown-ups were either thieves or murderers The kids were all delinquents Everyone around us And… to get out of this life… there was just one way Renji… Lets become Soul Reapers If we become Soul Reapers, we can live in Seireitei I hear its a nice place to live inside there Each of us came here all alone, searching for a family, and came together But this town was just too cruel for kids like us to survive in Ten years had passed since… Rukia had become our friend The rest of our friends were all gone Yeah, lets become Soul Reapers Shortly after that, we both entered the Soul Reaper Academy And our school life began, among the spoiled brats of the noble families However… Yes! I know that one! Please let me solve it, Sensei! I like your spirit! But in order for you to write on this blackboard, the other students around you would have to stand up to let you pass So Ill do it today He has no common sense Well, hes from District 78 of Rukongai, after all Whys he in such a rush to prove himself He really is vulgar Be quiet Now, lets move on to the next problem Renji… Oh…shucks! I cant waste time like this! Because unlike you, Im in a special promotion class Im really busy I like it when you raise your hands eagerly So…so keep showing that enthusiasm Okay W-What was that for Most of the students here come from nobility They cant understand the feelings of those whove led our kind of existence It cant be helped Yeah… Even after we left Rukongai and came to this Academy, there was a huge gap between them and us I swore to myself that I’d make them eat their words And… Whoa…! Sorry! Rukia! Youve gotta hear this! I passed the Second Exam! Now if I pass the next one, I… Kenseikan… Nobles Hmm… it seems weve been interrupted Now then, we will await a favorable answer This…amazing Spiritual Pressure! I cant even look into his eyes Renji… Oh…Hey Rukia Man, that seemed pretty intense What was that about What – The Kuchiki family… – Huh wants me as their adopted daughter Theyll let me graduate right away, and make arrangements to put me into one of the 13 Court Guard Squads Renji… I… You did it! Rukia! The Kuchiki Family is a powerful noble family! Thats great! If youre adopted by a family like that, youll live in luxury! I wonder what you eat as a noble Man! Im jealous! Not only that… You can graduate immediately! Damn! Im so jealous, I could throw up! Thats great! Its awesome! You think so Boy, Im speechless Thanks… Rukia finally found a family Don’t interfere, I mustnt Thats what I kept telling myself But when I think back… I mayve just been scared Dammit! Im a stray dog down to my bones! Im sick of it… I only bark at the stars… I dont have the guts to jump Its your fault that Rukia was imprisoned! Every time I thought about it, my blood boiled! But that wasnt it… Its because I didnt stop Rukia… That time, I…I didnt tell Rukia to go to the Kuchiki Family so shed end up being a condemned criminal I thought Rukia would find happiness…! I truly believed that…! I wanted to surpass Captain Kuchiki… From that day, ever since… Ive pursued him… Every day I trained like mad But I still havent been able to beat him, not once Hes too strong! Getting Rukia back with strength… was something I couldnt do! Kurosaki… Im swallowing my shame and asking you! Save… Save…Rukia! I will I shall put that unreachable fang in flames So that I need not look at that star So that this throat will not be torn apart To be Continued I looked up into the night sky and saw a comet I want to see you right now, but I cant fly If I could become a comet I would fly across the sky… Im sure I would circle the skies and shine over you With this instantaneous light that will definitely reach you If I could become a comet Im sure Ill always stay close to you Now and forever I am the new centurys charismatic medium, Don Kanonji!

What is it What do you mean, “What is it”! Did that pill do anything It didn’t, did it What are you talking about Doesn’t my face look like I’m full of energy It looks the same as a minute ago I think you were tricked, after all ‘Kay There’s no one around We just fought here yesterday It seems weird that there aren’t any guards around The enemy probably wouldn’t think we’d still be hanging around here a day later I suppose so… Boy, I’m full of energy now! I tell you, you don’t look it Hey, by the way, you think the others are okay Like the guy with the glasses and white cape, and the chick with walnut-colored hair… The “chick” That word’s not “in” anymore I don’t think “in” is the word anymore, either Owwie! I’m sorry! I’m sorry! Ishida and Inoue are a hundred times smarter than me So that means… you’re a hundred times dumber than they are That’s what it means Owie! I’m sorry! I’m sorry! Those two wouldn’t take on enemies they know they can’t beat They’re fine, I’m sure… What about the other one…Chad There’s even less cause to worry about him Why’s that I can sense it… Huh I can sense it, his Spiritual Pressure Ever since we landed here Besides… I can’t imagine Chad ever losing Damn… Y-You’re a monster… Where is Senzaikyu S-Senzaikyu When I asked where Rukia Kuchiki was, the last guy just said that and fainted I don’t know where it is Tell me U-Uh… T-Thataway… It’s way over there That white tower-like thing That’s Senzaikyu Oh… Please spare me… I see… Thanks Uh, no… Don’t mention it Turning your back on your enemy… You’re a fool! I-I’m sorry! I’m sorry! D-Don’t kill me! Save me! Forgive me! Please! I’ll forget I ever saw you! Don’t…come after me again… Huh N-No… I wont do it again He’s not going to kill me Really Now… We’re finally here… Let’s go! On to Senzaikyu! He’s here! It’s the Ryoka! It looks like he’s broken through the guardhouse Captain Kyoraku… Huh What, he’s here already Oh, well… I guess I’ll head out, then Are you really going It’s just one Ryoka I’m your assistant, but I should be more than enough Listen, Nanao… It’s old man Yama’s orders, after all He doesn’t want anyone thinking we’re still having problems with the Ryoka Grown-ups hate losing face, you know Besides… it would be awful if my Nanao went out to fight and ended up being injured Since when am I “your Nanao”! Oh… You’re even more heartless than usual That’s what’s so wonderful about you! I got it! I got it, so hurry up and go! Yes, ma’am Now, don’t look so worried It’ll be over before you know it I’ll just have some fun Dammit! This sure is a long staircase! How many steps are there anyway! Quit griping, will you! I’ll see you later! Huh! Didn’t I tell you That medicine really works – No way! – No way! Okay, we’re here! No one’s around Security’s lax here, too Okay We’re going straight through to the inner area Wha--! Huh…! W-What’s with this impossibly powerful Spiritual Pressure! Wha…What’s doing this! I looked up into the night sky and saw a comet I want to see you right now, but I cant fly If I could become a comet I would fly across the sky… Im sure I would circle the skies and shine over you With this instantaneous light that will definitely reach you If I could become a comet Im sure Ill always stay close to you Now and forever By the way, have we eaten anything lately Im hungry Then lets go to the cafeteria Okay, lets go eat some fried rice Not that way, this way! Funny… Ive waited so long, but they still havent come Kenpachis been stood up Oh! Here it is! Here it is!"

No one’s around! Securitys lax here, too Okay, were going straight through to the inner area Seireitei Squad Five Station In-Station Special Detention Cell Captain… You look awful Rangiku… Have you calmed down a bit Umm… I’m so sorry I’ve caused you trouble as well Huh  Oh… Never mind me, I wasn’t able to do anything Umm… How are things outside It’s chaotic Something such as this occurring within the station… It’s unheard of There’s still the  situation with the Ryoka Everyone’s doing their own thing, completely losing focus Then, what about arresting the perpetrator They still haven’t finished investigating the crime scene We have no choice but to await the General Captain’s decision But… But the one who killed the Captain… Stop it! Don’t say such a reckless thing! I know I just said that everything was chaotic But Squad 5 is the one suffering the most right now They’ve lost both their Captain and Lieutenant at the same time You know what that means It’s not that I don’t understand how you feel However… At that time… At the time you found Captain Aizen, the actions you took… Was there no other option, was that truly what had to be done Couldn’t you at least consider that The title of the Lieutenant shouldn’t be taken so lightly I’m so sorry I…  I… Here This was in Captain Aizen’s room It’s addressed to you Captain Aizen… for me You’re lucky it was our captain who found it If it were anyone else, it probably would have been submitted as evidence It may never have reached you I don’t know what’s written inside, but… Having your captain leave his final words to you, that ought to be a happy thing for a Lieutenant Appreciate it as you read it Oh, thank you very much Hinamori, if you’re reading this letter, then I must not have made it back The Captain… He knew he was being targeted Last night, after I fell asleep… he wrote this letter Captain… I’ve caused you a lot of worry For that, all the words of apology would never suffice Until now, I have never spoken to you about the apprehension I have felt However, I want you to understand that it was only because I did not wish to get you involved in this Please, if possible, forgive me For after all this, I still got you involved I am probably no longer with the living Therefore, to you, in whom I have utmost trust, I leave this record of the truths which I have uncovered This is…! Wha--! What is this, this… outrageous Spiritual Pressure! Crap! Let’s run for it! I don’t know what’s up, but I’m sure theres someone terrible around the corner! Before the enemy finds us, we’ve got to run and get ahead! Yeah! Y-Yes… Let’s go! He’s finally here I was getting tired of waiting Let’s see Something’s wrong What’s going on We’ve been running and running and yet, I don’t feel any distance between us and the enemy My legs feel heavy Damn, I’m running, I know I’m running… This Spiritual Pressure… It’s like I have a knife pressed against my throat the whole time… Huh, hey! What are you doing! I-I’m sorry There’s no strength in my body I swear… you sure are a handful Are you all right Shut up! Never mind, run! Three of them, huh… Which one is it Not that one… Not that one… Are you the one What’s the matter How long are you going to keep looking over there Eh… Wh-What the heck What’s the matter How long are you going to keep looking over there Eh Wh-What the heck I’m sure I was stabbed The intent to kill Could just the killing intent do that You’re Ichigo Kurosaki, right How do you know my name Who are you What Haven’t you heard from Ikkaku Heard from Ikkaku Wait a minute… Let me ask you one thing What Among your group, who is the strongest That’d probably be me I see Then you had better watch out for my captain He has no interest in weaklings, but if what you said is true, then you will surely be targeted by him Is he strong You’ll find out just how strong when you meet him That is, if you survive long enough to even comprehend just how powerful he is What’s his name I’m Kenpachi Zaraki, captain of Squad 11 I’m here to fight you to the death I felt Spiritual Pressure again To feel it through the Sekki-Seki walls of this tower… What is going on outside Let me tell you about one unconfirmed report You know about the Ryoka that entered the Soul Society yesterday, right There were five Allegedly, one of them is an orange-haired Soul Reaper wielding a body-length sword Ichigo… Is it really you If you’re still alive… I couldn’t wish for anything more Run away Run…and forget about me In this world, there are forces which defy the logic of the living world Run, run away So that you may live… So this is him So this is Kenpachi Zaraki, Captain of Squad 11 Should you encounter a captain, don’t hesitate and get away! The Spiritual Pressure I’ve been sensing until now was his How do I get away from that! What’s the matter I said, I’m here to fight you… to the death Since you haven’t replied, shall I start Ganju! Hanataro! Hana…! Hey! Are you okay… You idiot, Ichigo! Ganju! Hanataro and I caught a bit of that Spiritual Pressure Don’t worry Never mind us, you just face what’s in front of you Or he’ll take you out before you know it! Wow! Look at that drool! He must have been really scared of Kenny, poor thing! Oopsey… He got mad at me Stupid It’s your fault What is she Where’d she come from! Why How come shes totally unaffected Stupid is as stupid says Is that so Hey, you twerp! Yeah What the heck are you I’m Yachiru Kusajishi Lieutenant of Squad 11 Pleased to meet you! Lieutenant! She’s the same rank as Renji But… Just now, I didn’t even notice her until she landed on me She’s no ordinary one either Ganju! Yeah! Take Hanataro and go on ahead! I’ll manage somehow Take care of Rukia! What are you saying Ganju! Please… Damn… My my, they went away Sorry, but I can’t let you pass through here You don’t get it, do you What! Don’t make me repeat myself I’ve been waiting here just to duke it out with you Your friends or that Kuchiki what’s-her-name… Whether they drop dead is no concern of mine Is that so Hey, not bad Though your stance is rigid and full of gaps Your Spiritual Pressure is something else Your run-of-the-mill lieutenants would be no match No wonder Ikkaku lost But, you’re still not up to par with me How about it I’ll give you a handicap What I’ll let you take the first swing You can cut me up anywhere you like Wha--! Awesome! Kenny, you’re so generous! Aren’t I I’m literally a bleeding heart of generosity! Stop messing with me! What the heck are you saying You think I can attack someone who hasn’t drawn their weapon Are you mocking me I’m not mocking you It’s just a freebie It’s admirable that you don’t want to attack someone who hasn’t drawn, but you better save that nicety for another occasion Don’t be so uptight Let’s have some fun To kill or to be killed… It’s just another way to kill some time So, come on You can go for my neck, my gut, my eyeball… If you want, you can even kill me with this attack Stop quivering! Come! Ichigo… No, Ichigo! You’re in danger, run! Idiot, quit squirming! Are you a moron It’s dangerous to move all of a sudden! W-Where are we Where’s Ichigo We’re on our way to the Shishinro Ichigo…stayed behind with them Stayed behind! By himself! He can’t! He has to get way! I have to go back and help! Huh Hey Hana, calm down It’s impossible! There’s no way he can defeat him… Even Ichigo will be killed! Hana, you know that pokey-headed guy He is… He is the Squad 11 Captain, Kenpachi Zaraki The name “Kenpachi” is passed down through the generations to the one among the 13 Court Guard Squads who most loves fighting and most loves killing The name means, no matter how many times he’s killed, he will never go down It’s beyond the realm of being strong or weak He cannot die He’s immortal! If Ichigo fights him, he will surely be killed I see… After hearing that, I’m even more sure we can’t go back Ganju! Listen up! That guy… Ichigo asked us… Ichigo asked us to take care of Rukia Kuchiki We all felt that Spiritual Pressure Ichigo and I both know that that wire-headed freak isn’t normal So Ichigo made up his mind… to stay back and fight, so that we can go ahead And that was because more than anything, Ichigo was determined to make saving this Kuchiki person the priority! Do you understand, Hanataro We’ve been entrusted to carry out that determination! Ganju… We can’t be dawdling here! If you get it, then let’s go! Y-Yes! Ichigo… After we’ve saved this Rukia, we’ll surely come back for you… And when we do, let’s all go back to the Rukongai together I still have a ton of things to tell you So Ichigo, until then, don’t you dare die! You’ve got to be kidding… I know I swung with my full force Why is it that… there’s not even a scratch on him Why is it that… my hand’s split instead This… What Hey… Is that it I’m so disappointed What was that What did he just do He touched the Zangetsu’s blade with his bare hands! That’s crazy! It’s useless, Ichy! You can’t cut Kenny Because to Kenny, this thing is the same as not having a blade at all What… Want me to tell you Why your sword can’t cut me It’s nothing, really When two Spiritual Pressures collide, the one that’s pushed down gets hurt That’s all there is to it In essence… compared to that sword you honed with your spirit pressure in order to slay your enemies… the Spiritual Pressure that unconsciously oozes out of me is much stronger That’s all there is to it I swear… I can’t believe I spent days looking for a guy at this level Even as a joke, it’s not very funny Now it’s my turn At least, let me get the rust off of this thing, won’t you I’m counting on you, Ryoka I looked up into the night sky and saw a comet I want to see you right now, but I cant fly If I could become a comet I would fly across the sky… Im sure I would circle the skies and shine over you With this instantaneous light that will definitely reach you If I could become a comet Im sure Ill always stay close to you Now and forever Nanao! It’s finally our big turn Nanao, where are you Chad, youre gonna fight that old man Oh, where are you hiding Hmm…it seems so Are you sure about that Na-na-o!"

Huh What, he’s here already Oh well… I guess I’d better head out… Will you really be going It’s just one Ryoka… and as your lieutenant, I should suffice You see, Nanao… It’s Old Man Yama’s orders, so it can’t be helped He doesn’t want anyone to think that the Ryokas are giving him any more trouble Oh, don’t look so worried… It’ll be over soon It’s just a little distraction Wait! You’ve come far enough, you foolish Ryoka! I am the lieutenant and third seat of Squad Eight, Tatsufusa Enjoji! You have chosen the wrong path! From the moment I appeared here, this path came to a dead-end! Now, now, what’s the matter! Can’t make a move Nothing to be ashamed of That is normal After all, this is the technique of the great swordsman, Tatsufusa Enjoji! So far, not one has defeated--! In the beginning, two blasts a day was my limit Now, I don’t tire even after firing more than five blasts… I’ll have to thank Yoruichi for training me Whew! Good job! I’m Squad Eight Captain, Shunsui Kyoraku Pleased to meet you Squad Eight… Captain… Yup, how do you do Hey Nanao! That’s enough flower petals! Huh Maybe she didn’t hear me Hey, Nanao Hey! Enough flower petals! Cute, cute Nanao! Lovely, lovely Nanao! Sorry, but… I don’t have time for your skit Let me pass… What, can’t you get in the groove a bit Everyone’s so indifferent I’m in a hurry, please move aside from there You don’t seem like a bad guy If possible… I don’t want to fight you Hmm… You’ve got me there Neither one of us wants to fight But I can’t let you pass, either Isn’t there any way you could just withdraw I can’t do that I see Then you leave me no choice Let’s have a friendly drink! Huh! Well, if you can’t withdraw, I thought maybe you could stop here for a while at least It’s just for a little while… I cannot! Aww, come on… Its the law Minors can’t drink alcohol Oh, yeah That’s a problem That’s no good, is it Never mind then The other captains are on the move too Soon this battle will be over So if you could sit out until… The other captains! So, Ichigo and the others are being pursued by the captains as well The situation’s changed Kyoraku, please move out of my way now! And if I say no I won’t let you! My, oh my… This sure is becoming cumbersome You missed again Why… How come… He deflected the first blast with one hand And since then, he’s dodged every single one Why hasn’t a single shot landed on target He doesn’t even have a scratch… The last guy said that he was a lieutenant… That should be only two levels between him and the captain Just two levels, and yet so far apart… Is the captain class on such a different level! Stop already, I’m sure you realize… your skills are certainly great It’s hard, fast, and for a human, you have an impressive destructive ability But, you can’t hit me I’m sure you can see where this is going Why don’t you give up and go home already Thanks for the warning! But I cannot withdraw! Stop it, already… I’m sure you realize… There are techniques which completely run out at the point of exhaustion, and those you can push beyond that, at the expense of draining your lifeforce Your attacks are obviously of the latter type I won’t say anything rude, so just go on home! If you keep going like this, you’ll really die! Oh boy, what a problem Why do you have to keep fighting so What’s your purpose Why did you come here My purpose is to save Rukia Kuchiki! Rukia Wasn’t it just this spring that she went missing in the human world That’s too short It’s a shallow friendship I would hardly think that’s worth risking your life for It’s true I know nothing about her… And that it may fall short of being worthy of risking my life However, Ichigo wants to save her! So that’s enough! I don’t need any other reason to risk my life! Aw geez, what a problem Well, if you’re that determined, then it would be insulting to ask you to go away I guess it can’t be helped Then, I guess I’ll have to take your life! Ichigo… I will…defeat him I will probably have to risk my life Should I survive, this time, I will vow… The same promise as that time, in the same words as that time Damn you! Take that! Hows this! Damn! You’re so stubborn! Drop dead! Y-You’re… Oh no, let’s get out of here! Aw damn! You remember this! Why were you just standing there, Chad It’s Sado Enough of that already! This time, you were lucky I happened to be around, but you could have gotten seriously hurt You’re incredibly strong Why’d you let those guys beat you up like that Why didn’t you go at it like the time you saved me I made a vow… to never use my fist for myself It’s a promise I made with Abuelo Abu… come again Abuelo It means “Grandpa” His name is Oscar Joaquin de la Rosa What ethnicity is that Mestizo He’s Mexican Before I came here, I was in Mexico Last month when you introduced yourself, you said you were from Okinawa! Did I Yeah, you did! Oh, never mind! Say whatever you want Fine, I won’t save your hide the next time! By the way, that thing you’ve always got around your neck… Is that something precious Yeah… Sure is It’s precious… Probably more than my life Looks like a foreign coin Where’s it from Mexico Geez! There you go again Hey! Hey! Whose is this It might belong to one of that earlier bunch Its a hassle… but I guess I’ll get it back to them You should just throw it away! Neither was a lie I was born in Okinawa, and went to Mexico That’s all… I lost my parents when I was young With no other relatives, I was taken in by my Abuelo in Mexico I was eight years old Yasutora! But I was a rotten kid, hopelessly spoiled I relied on my size and if anyone so much as irritated me, I would punch them out And the one who strictly scolded me into shape was Abuelo… Back then, I was truly, hopelessly spoiled And…on that fateful day, I was hopelessly careless Huh These wires are awfully thick  I don’t think I can break out of these… This is the end for the Chad of Mashiba Middle School So, how does it feel Does it hurt enough to make you want to piss Huh! So if it hurts, I’m supposed to piss Then I guess it’ll be a while… Sorry Oh yeah Then, how’s about this I know! You value this more than your life So if you lost this, then you’ve got to die, right So die, you fool! Wait! Those big and strong fists of yours – for what purpose  were you blessed with them Learn about that This amulet will help you Thanks to Abuelo, I grew up to be a decent person I could thank him until my voice went hoarse, and it still wouldn’t be enough Eh Wha…! No way can you break that Kick him down-- Bastard! Huh! What the--! Thanks! You’re… Ichigo Kurosaki of Mashiba Middle School! Hey, listen up! Why are you fishing around in Yokochin’s pocket Oh! There it is! Yokochin, are you all right Yokochin! D-Damn it! I told you guys not to call me that name… How many times do I have to tell you! Yokochin! Ah, excuse me I’d like to call an ambulance A-An ambulance Damn you! Are you worried about Sado before you even fight us Don’t mock us! The location is on the second block, under the bridge Number of ambulances… One, two, three, four, five… Five ambulances Damn you! Damn you! Hey, how’s about this, Chad You stay the same and not throw any punches for yourself Instead, you throw those punches for me And I’ll throw the punches for you If you’re going to stake your life to protect it, then I’ll stake my life to protect it, too It’s a promise Yeah… That’s right It’s a promise That’s why I can’t lose… Those big and strong fists of yours – for what purpose were you blessed with them I’m sorry… I looked up into the night sky and saw a comet I want to see you right now, but I cant fly If I could become a comet I would fly across the sky… Im sure I would circle the skies and shine over you With this instantaneous light that will definitely reach you If I could become a comet Im sure Ill always stay close to you Now and forever Kenny, one of your bells fell off Oh yeah Wait a sec, Ill fix it right away Did you set your hair yourself A mans got to look good! Kenny, youre so talented! Want me to do your hair, too No, no thank you Dont be bashful Really"

Who’d have thought his final attack would be this powerful If I’d taken a direct hit, it could have been really bad for me It’s amazing for any human to even get into Seireitei, but to think he could fight this hard… Captain Kyoraku! We have a message! What is it Its not like you to be out of breath Come to think of it, one of the boys from Ritei-tai was here, wasn’t he What did he want Captain Aizen has… passed away… Wha--! The cause of death was removal of his Saketsu Chain and Hakusui, and destruction of his heart It wasn’t an accidental death He was murdered The murderer is unknown It is a top-priority message signed by both Head Captain Yamamoto and Captain Hitsugaya, so I don’t believe there is any mistake I see Shosuke was… Well, anyway… Shall we go and see him Yes, sir Chad… Chad… Chad… Chad… Chad! Is something wrong, Captain Kyoraku This Ryoka isn’t dead, is he Shall I deliver the final blow Chad! Shall I deliver the final blow Leave him be Girls shouldn’t do things like that But… the person who killed Captain Aizen was probably one of the Ryoka! Hmm… Perhaps But then again, maybe not Huh No…I’m just talking about possibilities Anyway, there’s no need to be in such a hurry to kill him Let’s call the rescue squad and have him put into a cell somewhere If there’s the possibility that one of them is the killer, all the more reason to keep him alive You understand, don’t you Yes, sir I will make the arrangements at once I apologize for trying to meddle Things seem to have gotten quite out of hand Chad! He’s alive! It’s faint… but his Spiritual Pressure is still there! That’s right What am I hesitating for I… If I lose here… Chad…and Inoue… and Ishida…and Ganju… and Hanataro… and Yoruichi… All the people who have lent me their strength… They’ll all die! I haven’t got any time… to be afraid! So, finally you show yourself Are you prepared to die Or, have you just given up Both of those… are wrong! Wait for me…Chad! I’ll beat this guy… and I swear… I swear… I will…save you! Sorry… I don’t feel like dying yet If I die, everything on my shoulders will be destroyed I can cut him… I can! Now I know I can fight him I know… I can defeat him! What’s this You can do it if you try! Don’t let your guard down yet Stay…sharpened like that… This is where the fun begins Right… Ichigo Kurosaki… Kenny seems so happy… Sosuke Aizen, Captain of Squad Five, has passed away When he was lowered from the wall, he was no longer breathing Is there any possibility of a gigai Yes I investigated every possibility, including the chance that someone had used a gigai to deceive others’ eyes But it only served to confirm the truth of his death After this wartime chaos is resolved, a new captain of Squad Five will be selected by the Central 46 and Squad leaders Squad Seven Captain Komamura… Squad Nine Captain Tosen… Would you two please return to command your squads I too…shall visit the front lines soon Thank you for your efforts, Captain Tosen… Captain Komamura… How was he I see… What did Captain Unohana say Just that Captain Aizen had passed away In order to inquire into the truth behind Captain Aizen’s death, it seems the quickest route lies in ending this fighting Then…that means… Yes I will join the fight Nothing would be better than to avoid fighting, but it seems things aren’t going to go so smoothly Fighting… If not for fighting, people would not be mislead by ugly emotions and neither would ugly tragedies occur Finally, it is time for Captain Tosen’s “suzumushi” to cry out I detest fighting… from the bottom of my heart That’s good… Good reaction! Your concentration is improving! Unlike earlier, you can actually hear my bells ringing! I wear the bells and my eye patch just so I can get greater enjoyment out of my battles There’s no reason for me to wear them if you don’t take advantage of them Damn! You take me for a fool! And that’s why you won’t release your Zanpaku-to, either Do you realize My sword can cut you now If you let your guard down and -- My Zanpaku-to doesn’t have a name My sword is out in the open It has never had a sealed form This is the true form of my Zanpaku-to Is that so Well, that’s a relief to hear So that means your sword won’t get any more powerful than it is now In that case… “In that case,” what “I’ll be able to win soon” Is that what you thought You’re the one taking me for a fool The reason I don’t seal my Zanpaku-to is that… my Spiritual Pressure is so huge that I can’t seal it, even if I use all my might So, when I fight, I make it a habit to hold back when I swing my sword Do you see why If I didn’t do that, my enemies are so weak that I wouldn’t have enough time to enjoy the battle! I told you not to let up, didn’t I On your Spiritual Pressure Loosening up just because you found a chance or two of victory… What a boring ending And it had been a long time… since I came up against someone who could have killed me, or could hear my bells during battle Is this the end No fun at all… Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn! I don’t want to die! Don’t want to die! Don’t want to die! How can I die in a place like this! I can’t… afford to… die yet! Move…! Move, body! Stop, blood! Let me… fight one more time! I… I have to… save Rukia! I looked up into the night sky and saw a comet I want to see you right now, but I cant fly If I could become a comet I would fly across the sky… Im sure I would circle the skies and shine over you With this instantaneous light that will definitely reach you If I could become a comet Im sure Ill always stay close to you Now and forever Did you see that, Ichigo! This is the strength of our Captain! This isnt over yet! Im going to turn things around now! Oh How T-That is… Right Im looking forward to it, too Kenny, looks so happy! Ill do my best!"

Fine Then I shall take you This is…! What are you doing B-But unless I do this, Ill fall again! You neednt worry about that Back then, your Hollow transformation made this inner world lose its stability Thats why it happened But its different this time Take a look Even amidst the fierce fighting, your inner world does not even quiver Hold it… hold it… Are you saying that my mind is normally in this up-down-sideways state! It seems you have grown a bit stronger Wow…totally ignoring me, huh Stand, Ichigo! Hey, thats dangerous! Whod throw an unsheathed sword like that! Hang on to it Its your sword Huh But this is…you…I mean Zangetsu… Asauchi… It is a nameless Zanpaku-to wielded by a low-ranking Soul Reaper who was unable to join Squad 13 Yeah…but my Zanpaku-to is Zangetsu Zangetsu… the one that was broken by your opponent earlier This one I cannot give this to you! Wha--! Whatre you doing! Get outta the way! W-Who are you! Aw cmon, you know me, partner From now, we will test whether you deserve to wield me If you wish to hold me once more, take me away with your own hand! Your enemy is yourself Hah! Take it away, huh Sounds good Do it, partner! That is… if you can! I cant counter him! Amazing! I didnt know Zangetsu was such an amazing sword! The atmospheres nearly burning away from the spiritual aura Its like a monster! The usual Zanpaku-to seems like a wooden stick compared to it! What can I do with something like this! Dammit! Whats the matter, partner If you just stand around, Ill kill you! What! Sheesh, missed… He swings the Zangetsu with the cloth wrapping from the hilt… Whats with this fighting-style I never even thought… of something like that! Hah! Youre pathetic! You had this awesome sword, so how could you get bloodied like that I cant understand it Can you become a friend with someone you just met, simply by asking his name What Because thats what youre doing! You think youve mastered Zangetsu just by calling its name Youre so full of yourself… You dont even try to draw out its full power or try to understand it! You believe that as long as you train yourself, youll get stronger! Hes right I didnt even try to understand that Zangetsu The Zanpaku-to isnt a tool… Each one of them has a name, theyre alive And yet… My Zanpaku-to doesnt have a name This is its true form Oh yeah Im relieved Then I guess that means your sword wont get any stronger Relieved, what a joke! Cut the crap! Im no different As it is, Im no different from that bastard who didnt care about his Zanpaku-tos name I want to know… Now then, lets end this Ill show you… what it means to master Zangetsu To you, who could never master it until death! Show me, old man Zangetsu… Even a little at a time…about you… I want to know about you, the source of my strength And let me… once more… fight with you! Youre giving me one more chance Thank you, old man Hes gone Oh well Was that good enough Yes, thanks for coming Dont mention it After all, he is the king of this world He has to win Well, Im done here, right Let me go back Yes Hes strong… Zangetsu Nurture him well That power is going to… be mine eventually Ichigo… I hate the rain And it rains in this world, too If your heart is troubled, the skies will become cloudy If you grieve, it will rain ever so easily I wonder if you can understand… The fear of being rained upon in this lonely world To stop that rain, I shall lend you any strength If you have faith in me, I will not allow any rain to fall upon this world Ichigo, trust me You are not fighting alone What! That kids pulse which had disappeared is… And this Spiritual Pressure… His bleeding… has stopped! I cant push down… Sorry, but I dont have time here Im gonna end this quickly End it quickly, huh Cant allow that Not after… its gotten so much fun! I love it! How come you revived How come youre suddenly much stronger Ive got a bunch of questions bothering me! But forget them for now! Lets just have fun with this fight! Dammit! Im the one charging! So how come he wont go down! This isnt right! Somethings wrong with you! You love fighting that much Arent you afraid of being cut, of dying! Somethings wrong with me Something’s wrong with YOU! Youre so strong, why dont you love fighting! Enjoy it! Relish in death, in pain! Isnt that the price we pay! What is going on W-Who are you! Yumichika! Hey! So long! No! Was it the explosion! The fireworks made it like that Dont laugh! Fine, Ill put this on! What I was just thinking that the Captain seems to be having fun Youre right Whos his opponent His strength is amazing Its Ichigo That kid has gotten stronger from the time we fought Hes like a different person Maybe Captain is on the defensive This is bad Even the Captain might… Fool! No way hed lose! This is the ultimate! A draw! No, its just slight, but youre better Since when…have I felt such elation! How come…hes going easy I think, with you… I can fight with all my might! Lieutenant Kusajishi, I have an urgent message! Yes, later… Huh But this is a Level 1 missive signed by both Head Captain Yamamoto and Captain Hitsugaya of Squad 10 Hmm…then, later Lieutenant, please! I was ordered to deliver this message to everyone immediately, sir! Shut up! Kenpachi is fighting So dont bother me! What the hell! The moment he removed his eye patch, his Spiritual Pressure jumped up! Thats dirty! You have another trick after fighting this long Whatre you hiding in that right eye! Hiding In my right eye Hah! As if Id stoop to such a low trick I asked Technological Development to make this, a monster that consumes spiritual energy Im gonna pump it all out… all this spiritual energy… in order to kill you Thats all it is Can you hear it, Ichigo The cries of his sword Yeah… He cannot hear it When two who do not trust each other fight, they only destroy each other And one who only believes in himself cannot understand this Ichigo, can you trust me That goes without saying Im putting all my power in your hands Do what you will with it And lend me your power! Yes Oh… After all this time, your Spiritual Pressure still increases This is fun Of course, it increases Im borrowing Zangetsus power and fighting alongside him I will never lose to someone like you… who only fights alone! Zangetsu Is that the name of that Zanpaku-to Borrowing the power of your Zanpaku-to and fighting alongside it… Nonsense! Zanpaku-to are mere tools for fighting Thats the line of a weakling who has no confidence in his own strength, so he borrows the power of the Zanpaku-to! And that is… not my line, Ichigo! Hes coming, Ichigo! Im near the limit of my ability to stop the flow of your bleeding We will finish this in one blow Sorry…everyone… Happy people Come on, come on, come on Happy people Here we go! Everybody stand up! Everybody fight! Within your heart, you may feel uneasy But keep your head right up! To the sky! No matter when (Oh yeah!) No matter where (Oh yeah!) Just call me anytime! (Oh yeah!) I’ll be here for you Happy people in the house!!! With a tough smile Happy people in the house!!! Let’s live! Wow Happy people in the house All right Happy people This is an announcement to recruit members for the Zaraki Squad! All those who were moved by the Captains fighting, gather round! If you join now, the Lieutenant will give you a nickname! Send your applications to Ikkaku Madarame, or Yumichika Ayasegawa! Well be waiting! No soliciting!"

I’m counting on you! That was dangerous! Sorry… The sounds have stopped… And the Spiritual Pressure is gone Both of them… Which of them died I don’t know The diffused reflection of the Sekki-Seki is causing the traces of Spiritual Pressure to be wiped away Why There should be no good reason… that blood is spilled for my sake Please tell me… Kaien… There now… That should do it!

You won, Kenny! Don’t laugh like that! Fighting together with your Zanpaku-to… Yachiru… Hmm You remember that time I gave you your name Of course! I even remember how many clouds there were in the sky! Yeah… Me, too K-Kenny… Be quiet… I’d forgotten for a long time… How painful it is, having no name Everyone else would be called by name, but I didn’t have one That feeling… It is read “Yachiru” It’s the name… of the one person I wish to be like I’ll give it to you Ya…chiru… I’m Kenpachi It’s the name given to the mightiest Soul Reaper in every generation I will take that name starting today I’ve kept you waiting for such a long time You might think, “What the heck, after all these years,” but…do you think you could tell me now… what your name is No good, huh I want to get stronger I found someone to fight I can get stronger I want to fight! I want to get stronger! It’s been a long time… since I’ve felt like this I want to get stronger! I had no name, and no parents Where I was, was North Rukongai, Area 79, known as Kusajishi I have no memory of seeing anything there, other than the color of blood Everyone around me was closer to beast than human A baby like me could have been stomped to death at any time Then, you came along From North Rukongai, Area 80, Zaraki From the very depths of darkness, you carved up my bloody world in an instant, and…you gave me a name If you hadn’t appeared, I would not be here today Yes Since that day, you have been my entire world You can do it, Kenny… You are the strongest, Kenny! So, let’s get stronger and stronger together! Huh Kenny Kenny… Kenny… Kenny! The Spiritual Pressure has finally died down Still, it sure was something fierce What’s wrong with you Your body is trembling How pathetic! W-What! You’re the one who’s trembling! What! What part of me What’s this Bird droppings H-Hey, what’s the matter! Huh! There you are, damn you… I won’t let you get away! Ganju, you overdid it That was mean Shut up! What about you! What was that medicine This It’s a kind of anesthetic called “Shinten” One drop on the skin of someone with low Spiritual Pressure will cause him to get dizzy and pass out Y-You’ve got some scary stuff there, kid You think so But anyway, let’s hurry Oh… So the entrance is the shutter type Now the question is, how do we open it No problem Huh What do you have this time I borrowed a spare key from the underground water channel storage room last night H-Hey… Is it okay for you to do that It’s probably not okay, but… But I thought about it last night Ichigo is getting all battered up fighting… while all I do is keep running away It looks pretty bad, I thought I want to save Rukia, too So I decided I’d do all I could toward that end Even if it means I will be punished later Of course, stealing a key is about all I can do That’s why I’m no good No I’d say it’s enough Huh What you’ve done… Man, I tell you Everybody’s desperate to save this person This Rukia must be quite a cutie… Well, uh, it’s not that… You don’t have to get embarrassed Let’s see what she really looks like Hey, Rukia! Huh! Who are you Ichigo’s…comrade It’s me, Rukia! I’m so glad! You’re all right, aren’t you You’re…Hanataro! Why are you here We can talk later Ganju, let’s hurry and get away from here Huh What’s wrong, Ganju The pattern on his clothes… the unraveling eddy from heaven… Are you… a member of the Shiba clan Huh Oh, do you know each other Yeah I know her As if I could forget… that face… Shes… the Soul Reaper who killed my brother! W-What are you saying, Ganju Rukia wouldn’t… My brother’s wounds were from a sword His neck was slashed, and he’d been stabbed in the chest If he’d fought with a Hollow, why did he die of sword wounds! And at that time, she told me… that she had killed him! Ganju! That--that can’t be true! It’s all right, Hanataro He is correct R-Rukia A member of the Shiba clan… No doubt, it was your elder brother Shiba Kaien…was killed by me Do as you wish If I die by your hand, I will have no complaints What! Please stop, Ganju! We didn’t come here for that, did we! Didn’t we come here to save her! Please, Ganju! Didn’t Ichigo entrust us with his determination! Shut up, will you! W-What’s with this Spiritual Pressure What! Aizen’s been killed! When By whom Why This morning, before dawn This morning, before dawn The murderer and motives are, as yet… The murderer and motives are, as yet… unknown! unknown! Why didn’t you awaken me earlier Sir! I was concerned about your health, so I delayed the report Please punish me That’s not fair, Kotsubaki! Captain, please punish me, too Don’t copy what I say, Kiyone! I’m not copying you! That’s enough In any case… I can’t stay here like this That’s…Squad Six Captain, Byakuya Kuchiki! Byakuya Kuchiki… H-He’s… You know him Of course The Kuchiki clan is one of the four noble houses with the highest rank That guy’s the current clan leader Of the thirteen captains today, he’s probably the most famous This is the worst thing that could happen… Someone like him appearing at a time like this It’s no good There’s no way we could win Maybe we should just beg for our lives W-What are you saying, Ganju! Let’s run away with Rukia! You idiot! Do you see any way out! This bridge is the only way! Are you telling me to risk my life for her! She killed my brother, you know! For someone… For someone like her! I understand I guess it can’t be helped There was never any reason for you to save Rukia, to begin with It would be asking too much to force you to stay here So, at least when you escape from here, please take Rukia with you I’ll make a stand here, and hold him off W-What are you talking about I think I understand how you feel No one would give his life to save his enemy That’s got nothing to do with it! You felt the Spiritual Pressure, didn’t you! No way can we handle this I know that, too Still, I came this far because I wanted to save Rukia I can’t just leave without doing anything! Thank you for everything you’ve done! I’ll be on my way Don’t do it, Hanataro! You can’t… What are you doing Let me through! That fool! What does he think he can do without even a Zanpaku-to He’s trembling… You’re just a weakling Don’t go acting so tough! Dammit! Hey! Stay back! Ganju… Not…again! Sorry, Brother Avenging you will have to wait If you’re gonna blame anyone, blame Sis for not raising me to be a coward who would run out on his friends! Here I come, young ‘un! I am your opponent! Happy people Come on, come on, come on Happy people Here we go! Everybody stand up! Everybody fight! Within your heart, you may feel uneasy But keep your head right up! To the sky! No matter when (Oh yeah!) No matter where (Oh yeah!) Just call me anytime! (Oh yeah!) I’ll be here for you Happy people in the house!!! With a tough smile Happy people in the house!!! Let’s live! Wow Happy people in the house All right Happy people The story is finally reaching a climax Maybe its time for me to reveal my secret Can you guess what my secret is You can speak human, but not cat!

It’s been a long time, eh Byakuya boy Yoruichi Shihoin… Who is she I don’t know her No… I’ve heard that name before I think it was… Former Commander of the Stealth Force and Captain of Squad One Punishment Force, Yoruichi Shihoin I haven’t seen you in a while You’ve been in hiding for over a hundred years I thought you were dead Yoruichi… You came to rescue me, didn’t you Thank you Sorry, though Step aside I’ve got to defeat this guy Defeat him You Defeat him You fool! Wh-What’re you doing… Yoru…i… Medicine… “Gaten” or “hoten” You thrust a powerful anesthetic directly into him, didn’t you What do you intend to do with him, Yoruichi Ukitake… Nothing you do will help There’s no escaping from here Oh… You talk like a big shot now, don’t you Byakuya boy Have you ever once beaten me at “tag” Would you like to try me Did you think you could escape with such a slow Flash Step Did you think you could capture me with such a slow Flash Step Three days In three days, I’ll make this boy stronger than you This fight is postponed until then Give chase, if you wish “Flash Master” Yoruichi… won’t be caught by the likes of you yet They got away… Uh… Hey! Where’re you going, Byakuya Didn’t you come to capture the ryoka I’ve lost interest Do what you want now Good grief, he’s as willful as ever R-Rukia! The tension drained out of her  when Byakuya left It’s only natural Hey! Sentaro! Kiyone! Come out here! You called, Captain, sir! So you did follow me How long were you there From the time you said, “My, my, how dangerous,” and stopped Captain Kuchiki, Captain, sir! From the very start, then Didn’t I tell you not to come because it was dangerous Forgive me, sir! I respect you so very much, that I simply had to follow you here! No fair, Kotsubaki! Captain! I feel the same! I love y… N-No…! I respect you very much! Ha-h! I respect him much, much more than you, by far! Ha-ah! Shut up, Mt Fuji-head! Wanna fight, booger-face! Fine with me! Well, never mind Anyhow, Kiyone, contact 4th Squad One apprehended Wounded Yes, sir Send for an advanced relief squad ASAP Huh Sentaro, you take Kuchiki back to the cell Yes, sir Move N-No! I can’t let Rukia go back in there… Move! Damned booger! You think I’m doing this because I want to! Sorry, Kuchiki… The captain and I will appeal to the top brass afterwards and get you out of the cell Huh! Be patient until then No fair, Kotsubaki! I worry much, much more about Kuchiki than you! Kuchiki, the captain and I will promise, promise to get you out, all right! Why do you keep copying what I say! Wanna fight, copycat! Any time! You hurry up and call 4th Squad! Shut up! I was just about to! Uh…sir… You want to know why I’m helping you Uh…yes Of course, I’ll help you We don’t know who killed Aizen yet And it’s very likely that you outsiders know something about it We can’t kill you without investigating first And above all else… Though your methods were bad, you tried to rescue my subordinate I can’t let you die No one back there, either, sir! I see! Fine! Hey! You men take the East Nijo area! The ryoka are cunning! Don’t lose them! Yes, sir! Thanks for the report! By the way… I’ve never seen you two before Are you new Yes, sir! We joined this period! I’m Inoue! Please remember me, sir! I’m Ishida Please…remember me, sir My word… Whaddya say Why not come to my place tonight Sir You must’ve heard of me Toshimori Umesada! This year, I made 15th in the 20-seat Ninth Squad! Not that I’m boasting, but I’m the most successful of all my comrades! I’ll treat you good… When ryoka have infiltrated, and a wartime alert has been issued, I hardly think a squad leader has time for propositioning women What! You lowly underling! You dare lecture me! Sir Umesada! Nothing here, sir! Awaiting further instructions, sir! Dammit! Remember this! Once this commotion is over, I’m gonna give it to you good!! Be my guest By then, I’ll be long gone Thanks, Ishida! It wasn’t much… I just dislike his type Still, how incredible Aw, I wasn’t that great… It worked out beautifully I’m awesome! Oh, right… What! Steal the Soul Reapers’ clothing! Shh! Not so loud, Ishida! We’re just going to borrow their clothes! Appearance-wise, we’re not so different from Soul Reapers Only our clothes are If we can look like them, we’ll be able to get around more easily So we need their clothes Yes, we’re borrowing them! But… Here they come! When I say, “Go,” okay Ready, set, go! Ahh…I forgot to jump out Ms Inoue… Oh…! Here, your clothes I was quite surprised You knocked those two out without using your spirit powers You’re surprisingly strong, aren’t you Oh, really Eh, heh, heh Actually, I learned a little karate from Tatsuki Huh She said I had the skills of a first-level student Sh-She did Now, then We’d better get changed! W-W-Wait! Wait, Ms Inoue! Huh Oh…I see Sorry, sorry! Boys and girls can’t dress in the same room, can they I just felt like I was with Tatsuki… Oh…well… I… That being the case, here! “Ishida’s Special Dressing Room” “Comfy” “Spacious” Go right in! Shouldn’t it be the other way around Ishida! Ready Open up! W-Wait! Now, then… I got those two to tell me about the Senzaikyu where Kuchiki is being held The others must already be headed there Even Kurosaki… He might already have gotten there I see We’d better hurry, then We’ve got to help him before he screws up, all alone Right! What squad shall we say we’re from Oh… Yes… We should be able to answer quickly  if we’re asked, right Umm…you’re right… Maybe it’s because I haven’t fought in a hundred years I’m breathing hard after only a hundred Flash Steps or so How weak I’ve grown Oh, you’re awake, Ichigo Where am I Why… Why’d you bring me back alone! I was the one with the best chance of surviving back there! Now Ganju, Hanataro, and Rukia will all be killed! Don’t be so vain No one back there had any chance against Byakuya You…! Be still! Do you want to open up those wounds again Go…to…hell… One person was all I could carry and get away from Byakuya Then why didn’t you take Rukia instead of me True… Back then, no one there had any chance of defeating Byakuya But you alone have the ability to That’s why I brought you back Besides, Ukitake was there, too He’s Rukia’s superior, with a strong sense of obligation Though you’re insurgents, he’d never blindly kill anyone who came to save Rukia So, Ichigo, don’t worry Grow strong here As you are now, you’d never defeat Byakuya But I’ll train you so that you can Then go back and rescue everyone with your own hands! How’s the pain It’s much better than earlier We can’t wait for you to recover completely It might hurt, but you must do this Right! I dunno if I’ve seen this place before… You’re the first outsider I’ve ever brought here Impressive, huh Huhh… Well, never mind Time’s short, right Let’s get started! Fine Now… First, are you aware that your zanpaku-to is already in released mode It is Released mode, like Kenpachi Zaraki’s… No wonder its shape was different from other people’s swords And it never transformed when I called its name… Humph You weren’t aware of it, after all Then you don’t know Zangetsu can be released to another level Huh! Not just Zangetsu All zanpaku-to swords can be released to two levels The first release is called “Shikai” The second release is “Bankai” To perform these two releases, that’s a requirement for squad captains Requirement Right Except for one, all squad captains of the Court Guard have mastered “Bankai” One Kenpachi Zaraki In the vast history of the Soul Society, he’s about the only one to become captain without achieving “Bankai” or even knowing the name of his zanpaku-to It shows how greatly the 13 Court Guard Squads must value his fighting prowess and tenacity Having fought him, you should know that best of all The difference in power between the Shikai and Bankai levels, though dependent on each fighter’s ability and discipline, can be considered roughly five to ten times greater Ten times… An amazing increase, right That’s why, in order to achieve “Bankai,” even strong fighters train for over 10 years W-Wait a minute! – I ain’t got time…! – I know! But there is a way It’ll be pretty dangerous, but you’ll use a completely different method and master “Bankai” in three days! Three days! Happy people Come on, come on, come on Happy people Here we go! Everybody stand up! Everybody fight! Within your heart, you may feel uneasy But keep your head right up! To the sky! No matter when (Oh yeah!) No matter where (Oh yeah!) Just call me anytime! (Oh yeah!) I’ll be here for you Happy people in the house!!! With a tough smile Happy people in the house!!! Let’s live! Wow Happy people in the house All right Happy people Ishida, what squad shall we say we are Does each squad have a unique characteristic I’m sure! Like a squad that loves flowers, or a musical squad, or a squad that tells great jokes Inoue, you don’t understand a Soul Reaper’s work, do you"

Who are we to pass through you Whoa! That answer will find you someday You’re not going to sleep yet You’re going to make yourself sick Yeah, just a little bit more… How’s Tsubaki’s recovery Not yet… That time, I… Tsubaki! Koten Zanshun! I reject! Tsubaki! Fool…! Faltering like that! Tsubaki… I had already lost my will to fight Sorry, Orihime Healing one of our own requires a certain knack I’m so sorry… It’ll be okay, Orihime Your Shunshun Rikka have incredible powers Indeed! Any doubt in your heart directly influences our powers, so you need to be strong, Orihime! But… We’ll practice some more! So that you can ditch the Kotodama Spirit Chant, and summon us by just the attack names! If you can do that, we will be able to protect you faster! Y-Yeah… W-What is it Just wait a little longer… I’ll be better in no time U-Uh-huh! Are you ready Yep… I’m ready Let’s go This may have been for the best… Being with her these past days, it’s become very apparent Orihime is definitely not suited for combat! She hates seeing others get hurt more than anything Even if it is the enemy… A person like that shouldn’t fight For that kind of fighting will only bring harm to herself and her comrades Hey! You guys! Wait a minute! What are you guys doing over here! What squad are you with  Squad Eleven Oh That’s odd… I’m with Squad Eleven, too, but… In our squad that specializes in combat, this is the first time I’ve ever seen a dimwit walking around without carrying his zanpaku-to! Oh no! So each squad had distinctive traits! That’s Squad Twelve’s emblem Not ours… Guess you wouldn’t know, huh Who the heck are you guys Damn… I had hoped we could keep going quietly, but I have no choice! That was close, you guys! Were you hurt Of all things, doubting your own comrade, what a jerk! This guy’s drunk! T-Thank you very much! It’s okay, we’re in the same Squad Twelve, so it’s expected that we help each other These guys will pick any excuse to come next door to mess with us Damn it! When you’re rushed, it’s possible to forget even your sword sometimes! Here, this way! – We’ll walk you back to quarters – Sounds good! Wait… Think about it… Isn’t it strange for them to help us in this situation Even though he was drunk, what that man said was perfectly logical For what reason would these guys go out of their way to help us Orihime! Get away… Wh-Why… Captain! This isn’t what we agreed upon! Our role was to just talk to them, then bring them back to quarters – Oh, no – Then why this – A released bomb shouldn’t return – How could you do this, Captain! Captain--! A shield! Thank you If you hadn’t screamed out… I… No, we survived because you’ve been practicing all this time Wh-What about the others Unfortunately… But, that’s not something you should feel guilty about The one who should feel guilty, however…is you! Oh…! This is an interesting technique! That shield… Is it the work of that woman behind you I have no intention of answering you How interesting! That’s the first time I’ve seen that technique! How about it, woman! Won’t you work for me as a research subject Don’t be ridiculous! I said I have no intention of answering you! Should you work for me, I won’t do you wrong! Rest assured! I’m gentle with the ladies She’s crying… Why is she crying! Is she afraid No! Be careful! If she were afraid, she wouldn’t have risked danger just to save me! Then why Is she crying for those guys that died just now! Besides, why did she save me! I’m the enemy! What’s in it for her to save me I…I just don’t get it I know! I’ll offer you my best working conditions! I’ll limit drug therapies to eight times a day! And mechanical experiments up to five times a day! I’ll even do my utmost to refrain from performing surgeries which may be life-threatening! How about it Rather exceptional terms for an experimental subject, I should think He’s fast Oh… A Quincy, huh Such a rarity It’s been years since I’ve seen a live specimen But I’m sorry, I’ve finished researching your kind already So I’m no longer interested in your kind Step aside there! Finished researching What do you mean by that What are you What You Ryokas don’t bother to investigate first and just storm into your enemy’s base How careless… At the very least, you should commit to memory the names of the thirteen top people, I should think Captain of Squad Twelve, as well as the second-generation Chief of Research and Development, Mayuri Kurotsuchi You don’t have to remember that though Pretty soon, you won’t know anything anyway This guy… Orihime! Run! Hurry! No! I’ll fight too! Hey, you from Squad Eleven! Take Orihime and run! Y-You’ve got to be kidding! Why me You don’t want to die, do you If you drag your feet, you’ll be caught in the crossfire! Take her away by force, if necessary! Otherwise… I’ll shoot you! Hurry! D-Damn it! Come on, Missy! No! Did I say you could run away Did I say you could go after them My, my… I’m not interested in you Let–me–go–! – Please let me go! – Ouch, ouch, ouch! Oh, no, I can’t! I, Makizo Aramaki, a ten-year member of Squad Eleven, also known as Maki-Maki! I am a compassionate man who won’t leave behind women and children, even if I were asked to! Why, you… Sorry about that I have no intention of getting caught up in that freak Kurotsuchi’s fight or getting shot by that four-eyed jerk… So I had to be a bit rough there… Maybe I was a bit too rough… Maybe I should apologize when she wakes up… My, my… It takes quite an effort to get this set up… He took his own arm off! It hurts… It sure does hurt… It hurts…and it hurts… So much that my mind’s about to melt It seems that the woman has gotten away Oh well If there’s even a single strand of her hair left on the ground, that’s enough to track her down I can’t wait to capture and examine her until she turns to mush I hate to lose even a minute or a second Monster… There are two enemies… If Kurotsuchi is the captain, then is that woman behind him his lieutenant She hasn’t moved even though her superior has a bow pointed at him… does that mean… her combat abilities are low If so…then I should start with the captain! That guy…! Pretty good… Nice moves you’ve got there The previous one and the one just now… That was the “Hiren Kyaku,” right An advanced Quincy move that involves moving at high speed by creating a current of spiritual energy beneath the feet I never expected a young person like you to have been trained in it You’re pretty good Seems you’re quite talented… I couldn’t outrun him…! However, it’s a bit of a bother to have you running around me like that… After this, I need to capture that woman and conduct my research I’m busy, you see… So at this time… I’ll have to use a method with the least effort… to kill you Claw out… Ashisogi Jizo What are its abilities If they’re the type that absorb attacks… Then I can’t attack it head on! Damn it! Wha--! This one’s attacking! L-Let go! It can’t be…! No way… He really attacked his subordinate… Isn’t she a part of his team Why… You idiot! I thought I taught you to hold on, even if your arms were ripped out! M-My deepest apologies Oh well… It’s not like I expected much from you in the first place At least we got this far From here, it’ll take no more effort than strangling a baby He really sacrificed his subordinate just to kill me…! You’re sweating quite a bit It must hurt Without even crying out you bear your pain… You’ve got some will It’s not the first time you were cut by a sword It’s my second time…! Oh…so you’re quite experienced How nice…however… Geez, what a noisy one My deepest apologies… Sir Mayuri… May I have some of the Hojiku-zai as well… The wounds seem to extend to my lungs… At this rate… I may not… be able to sustain my life-force… What…! You! Are you insulting me! Eh! Are you! Your body! With just that cut! You’re saying it’s no good! Stop it! What are you doing Isn’t she part of your group She’s really going to die! And are you insulting me also You think she’ll die from just this This body which I created! With a wound of that degree! You think she’ll cease to function! You’d better be careful of whom you insult! You… Created… That’s right Let me tell you her name Nemu Kurotsuchi By melding the quintessence of my gigai techniques and gikon techniques I created this masterpiece So don’t go parading your creepy sense of justice around here How I decide to use this thing, for a stranger such as you, it’s none of your business! Stop it! It…it won’t move! Just realizing it now Pretty dense, aren’t you… From whatever it cuts, this robs the mobility of its four limbs That is the ability of this “Ashisogi Jizo” A paralyzing poison, huh Don’t be ridiculous It’s not something that primitive Of the countless signals fired from your brain, it selectively severs just the signals controlling the movement of your limbs Such a sophisticated drug is what it produces It’s not paralysis It robs only the movement of the limbs, in other words… Not an ounce of pain is lost Hey, Nemu! Get up! You’re going to strike the final blow! Nemu! Oh yeah, that’s right… You were cut with this also, so you can’t move either! Damn! You’re useless! Cut it out… What I said, stop it! Persistent, aren’t you Or is it something else Showing mercy to wounded women, even if they were the enemy, is that the pride of the Quincy that you all are so fond of What You are fond of it, aren’t you Because you all keep saying that line until the moment you die By the pride of the Quincy, I cannot do that! By the pride of the Quincy, I won’t allow that! It’s so annoying! Each and every one of you! Regardless, with one thrust of this, any words of resistance will become meaningless You… Now hold on This is the story of my hardships When I became the Chief of Research and Development, the Quincy were already a rare breed… We had put surveillances on the surviving members Well, purposely delaying rescue of that which you guard, just to obtain the konpaku, Can you understand Just how difficult this was But even with all that effort, there weren’t any decent research specimens The last specimen I had was a grubby old man He kept calling his apprentice’s or grandson’s name the whole time It was so creepy… Do you want to see his picture It’s after the experiments, so his original form wasn’t maintained What was the name of his apprentice Goodness… It seems once my experiments are concluded, I lose all interest… What’s that! The name of his apprentice… Do you want me to tell you… The name of his apprentice is… Uryu… Uryu Ishida This person is Soken Ishida… He was my teacher… As well as my grandfather! Oh… And I’m glad Orihime isn’t here This is one battle that I wouldn’t want her to see By the pride of the Quincy, I will kill you! Happy people Come on, come on, come on Happy people Here we go! Everybody stand up! Everybody fight! Within your heart, you may feel uneasy But keep your head right up! To the sky! No matter when (Oh yeah!) No matter where (Oh yeah!) Just call me anytime!

Wow Happy people in the house All right Happy people Lately, it feels like my appearances have been diminishing… Do not fret Yoruichi You shall have no appearances in the next episode either Ishida is going to do his best by himself Leave it to me If you do not master the Bankai soon, perhaps you may never have another turn I-I’ll do my best!"

Oh… And By the pride of the Quincy… I will kill you! Oh… Even though I immobilized your limbs with the Ashisogi Jizo, you managed to stand up… I know why… It is… Ransotengai! Countless threads of spirit particles bundle together and connect with immobilized parts to forcibly move them, like the strings of a puppet! Originally, elderly Quincies, in order to continue fighting Hollows, developed this technique Whether their tendons were cut, or their bones were crushed, it meant nothing with this technique It exists so that one can fight until one’s body falls to bits The Quincies’ ultimately superior battle technique… I had thought it was a lost art In fact, of the 2,661 subjects I have researched, no one could use even a hint of that technique And for you to use it at such a young age… A genius, one could say Genius You shouldnt refer to it by such a commonplace term What! My Ransotengai is neither an ordinary defense technique nor a way to prolong my life Until I avenge my master, even if I’m reduced to a corpse, it is the expression of my will to fight! Let me retract the term “genius” You’re just a greenhorn little brat Uryu… I heard you went to your grandfather’s place again How many times have I told you; stop going there B-But-- Don’t make excuses! I’ve told you time and again It’s pointless to save the dead Father--! That’s the Soul Reaper’s job You only need to study how to save the living I have no interest You have no talent The Quincies will end with your grandfather’s generation Do you understand Father… Why do you hate the Quincies so much Because they don’t make any money Hmm… There is truth in what he says These days, you can’t put food on the table by being just a Quincy With a family to support, that’s a big problem But still… Hmm… What he says is right B-But… I can see them! The Hollows, and the people being attacked by them… The Soul Reapers can’t handle them all I’ve seen it with my own eyes! I’m sure Dad can see it too So how… how can he say those things – Master… – Hmm I want to become strong! I want to become strong! I want to become a strong Quincy and protect everyone from the Hollows If I do that, then I’m sure Father will acknowledge the Quincies… Thank you, Uryu, my boy… Pretty good Maybe I could be interested in you… I won’t kill you I’ll take you back alive And have you be my research subject But Uryu… Try to understand your father too If you wish to protect changes, then your sense of justice changes as well It is like that What Father wants to protect What is that Money There will come a time when you understand And by that time, you should understand what it is that you truly wish to protect For that time, I shall leave this with you This is… This is the Sanreishuto It is a glove with the power to disperse spiritual particles at a high level If you put this on and create a bow, and are able to maintain it for seven days and seven nights, you will become infinitely closer to the pinnacle of the Quincy powers However, once you go there, Uryu… you must never remove this glove For if you do, at that moment, your ability to draw in spirit energy will have surpassed the limits of a Quincy Too strong of a flame, and you will burn yourself If you remove the glove, for a moment you will gain enormous powers, however… you will surely lose all your Quincy powers as well Well, shall we go now To my laboratory I wouldn’t want to kill you before that One day, you’ll understand your father’s feelings and when you find that which you truly wish to protect, at that time, if you still wish to follow the ways of the Quincy… You will surely come upon an unavoidable battle And a time may come when you must thrust yourself into a battle far beyond your abilities When that time comes, use this Sanreishuto However, I will say it again, once you put this on, you must never take it off I know of many ways to take you with me without killing you That is, if you don’t mind experiencing some hellish pain Shall I demonstrate one of those methods now There is a limit to the Ransotengai I cannot hold out forever I’m sorry… Master… I still don’t understand my father’s feelings And I probably don’t understand what I truly want to protect But that which cannot be forgiven… I think I do know that one I’m sorry… Master… I…just once more… I must disobey you! I…just once more… I must disobey you! Wh-What What is that! Wh-What is with that attire What is with that Spiritual Pressure I’ve never known such a thing! That…! He’s absorbing the structures nearby All the structures in the Soul Society are constructed entirely of spirit particles He’s managing to break those bonds and is forcibly absorbing the spirit particles In other words, the subjugation of the spirit particles! You’re exceeding the limits allowed to humans, you brat! He’s fast! But if this is all… Weep and beg for forgiveness And never appear in front of me again If you do that, I may let you go If you refuse, the next attack will be three times that! Don’t get carried away, you brat! A mere Quincy, toying with me… Fine Then I shall respond with appropriate force! Bankai! What’s that Ban… Konjiki Ashisogi Jizo! No way! That zanpaku-to was already released! Didn’t you know zanpaku-to have two stages of release What! Ashisogi Jizo is the first stage of my zanpaku-to, the Shikai And this Konjiki Ashisogi Jizo is the second stage In other words, the Bankai The deadly poison that this thing spews will kill off all of you! It’s regrettable that I can’t do research on an excellent specimen such as you Go! Sir…Mayuri… Damn it… You…Quincy lowlife! The ability to liquefy whatever it cuts… That was close, Quincy One’s last ace in the hole should only be used after much consideration In case he needed to escape, he left himself that ability! Damn it! It’s useless Although I cannot make any attacks in this form, I cannot be attacked in any way either For a few days, I cannot change back from this form, but during that time I’ll return to the Bureau and tend to my wounds… Farewell… Quincy… It was a bit cumbersome, however, I will live and you will die That outcome will not change Damn it! The poison… At this rate… Q-Quincy… Behind the Lieutenant’s emblem on my left arm… I have the antidote… Wouldn’t you be more comfortable lying down No… This is fine Yes, behind it there… You first No, I’m all right My body is made of the same substance as Sir Mayuri’s body This toxin will not kill me Are you thinking this may be a trap If so, please bring it up to my mouth I will drink to show you No There’s no reason to entrap someone who would have been poisoned to death anyway Thank you very much Had you aimed for the head, you could have killed Sir Mayuri But you did not… It was a fluke I had fired intending to kill him But you refrained from killing Sir Mayuri That antidote is a token of my appreciation I don’t get it How could you feel that way about someone like that I do not understand it either But, when I realized that he was still alive, I was somewhat relieved Well if you’ve drunk it, please go! I will be all right Soon the troops will arrive Thank you…for the antidote Good bye It hurts… My body feels heavy… My legs… I can’t raise my arm either… Damn… I guess the end is nearing for my time as a Quincy Orihime… I… I’m sure she’s doing fine I’m sure that guy from Squad Eleven would lead her here Ichigo… Chad… Yoruichi… Ganju… I wonder how they are I have to believe that they will arrive here That’s right! If I’m the first one here, I could rescue Rukia myself I bet Ichigo wants to save her himself If I did that, he’d be ticked off I bear no ill feelings However, for the sake of our peace, I must eliminate you Cry, Suzumushi!

That answer will find you someday My body feels heavy… My legs… I can’t raise my arm either… Damn, I guess… the end is nearing for my time as a Quincy… That’s right! If I’m the first one here, I could rescue Rukia myself I bet Ichigo wants to save her himself If I did that, he’d be ticked off I bear no ill feelings However, for the sake of the peace, I’ve no choice but to eliminate you Cry, Suzumushi Forgive me, Ryoka This is the end of a senseless battle Sleep Your battle will soon be over To advance from “Shikai” to “Bankai” typically requires well over ten years of training, even for those with talent However, you must achieve the “Bankai” in three days Wh-What is that strange doll Tenshintai It is one of the Stealth Squad’s most important specialized spirit tools It forcibly draws out the zanpaku-to’s true form and materializes it Uh I don’t quite get it How’s that thing necessary for the Bankai training What is necessary for the Shikai is a dialogue and harmony with the zanpaku-to In other words, instead of us entering the world of the zanpaku-to, what is necessary for the “Bankai” is the “materialization” and “submission” of the zanpaku-to “Materialization” refers to summoning the zanpaku-to into our world Normally, several years of training are required for this, but you, even though it ended in a draw, fought on equal footing with Kenpachi Zaraki So in actuality, you may have already reached the materialization or a comparable level as I see it Do you want to fight It seems you recall an instance… If you stab this with Zangetsu, it can forcibly bring it into the “materialized” state In other words, we can bring the zanpaku-to into this world However… Using this method, the “materialization” is limited to three days! During that period, you must defeat the “materialized” Zangetsu and force him into submission If you cannot… I won’t ask about that If this is the only way… Then I’ve got to do it! Seems you have recovered quite a bit, Ichigo Dude! You heard our conversation Of course I’ll leave the fighting methods to you Can you start right away Yeah… Wh-What the heck! Among these, only one… is the true me That is the only one that can defeat me If you wish to force me into submission, find it before I kill you! And… Slay me if you can! FOUR Greetings, everyone It is I, Squad Four, Third Seat, Yasochika Iemura What You don’t know me! You may have seen me here, or over there Since it seems some of you are not familiar with me, as an introduction, I wish to disclose my medical journal that chronicles our Squad Four’s strenuous activities – Hey, hurry it up! – Reporting! Lately, due to the recent Ryoka disturbance, our Squad Four station is in daily chaos! Especially, with the large number of those louts from Squad 11 hospitalized No! I mean, those gentlemen… it has kept us very busy On top of that, yesterday evening, both the Squad 13 and 8 captains requested to have a Ryoka admitted so we were forced to implement the three-shift emergency protocol Things are busy enough as is, and on top of this, being asked to admit the Ryoka is just… Really, enough is enough! Why these defeated Ryoka should be purposely hospitalized and treated in the first place is completely beyond me! I mean, the Squad 13’s Captain Ukitake is one thing, but Captain Kyoraku of Squad Eight is always goofing off and chasing after girls’ behinds and with that gaudy attire, always snoozing when something comes up How can someone like that become a captain, while I…! What is it Just now, we received a request from Captain Tosen of Squad Nine to admit one Ryoka I see And… You were thinking out loud However, I have the deepest respect for Captain Kyoraku In light of these points! He who was held by the Ryoka…! was physically and mentally subjugated by those Ryoka and had no choice but to obey That is my opinion! Therefore! I sincerely request that Captain Unohana of Squad Four judge the matter kindly! This concludes the arrest report from Captain Ukitake of Squad 13! I understand However, the damage caused by these Ryoka, whom you have aided, is substantial In light of your rank and responsibilities, I cannot condone your actions You do understand Fourteenth Advanced Relief Group Leader and Squad Four, Seventh Seat, Hanataro Yamada What’s the matter, Hanataro I wonder if what I did was a mistake Did I create more trouble for Rukia instead Who knows… However, seeing how you act so true to your feelings, I’m a bit envious of you Lieutenant! The rest is up to Captain Unohana… Let’s go, Zabimaru! I-I drew my sword against Miss Hinamori How could I… Despicable… I’m…despicable…! Burst! Tobiume! Raise your head, Wabisuke! Wh-Who’s there! My… This is just awful Can’t bear to look Captain…Ichimaru…! You look haggard, poor thing Want me to help you Huh, Izuru Stand up, Ichigo! Three days! Ichigo, you don’t have time to dawdle! I’ll say it once more Stand up, Ichigo! Stop stalling! Are you going to waste time! Never mind! If he cannot stand on his own… then I’ll drag him to his feet! ELEVEN My, was I ever surprised! To think that Lieutenant Kusajishi would pick me up at that place! I, Makizo Aramaki, am moved beyond words! Well…I didn’t really care about you Let…me…go! Please let me go! Oh, no, I can’t! Why you--! Sorry about that Maybe I should apologize when she wakes up Maki-Maki What’s that you’re carrying That Spiritual Pressure… A Ryoka No Well…you see, this, well… That’s a Ryoka, right This is, well, umm… there were circumstances… Circumstances Oh, like what Well…that is… This girl, you see…um… she suddenly spurted out of this area… Spurted out Yes, yes Like…bubbling Bubbling So I thought it was very unusual, and I wanted to show you Really! Then let’s take her back with us! Eh Well… I want to see her doing the bubbling thing! Well, that’s… I wonder if Ichi does the bubbling too Hey, Ara… Ara… umm… Ara…what’s your name again Ah! Pardon me! It’s Maki-Maki! Maki-Maki is fine! It’s been ten years since you so kindly took me into your care! Maki-Maki… Hah! That’s a weird name! Wha--! But that’s the nickname you gave me! So, what’s happening, Orihime She’s beautiful… Is Ichigo still alive I want him to be alive No, I’m sure he’s alive! Orihime… He’s alive I can tell He’s alive and he’s trying to get stronger still Interesting! I’ll lend you a hand, woman If I stick with you, I get the feeling I’ll see Ichigo again! – Yep! – Yes! Aye, aye, sir! FOUR Where is this Am I alive How Are you awake Wh-What are you, who are you! Are you a burglar, you jerk! Idiot! Why would anyone try to steal from an injured man in prison It’s me, me! G-Ganju! You’re alive! Good! You didn’t seem too strong so I thought maybe… That line… I’ll throw it right back at you Still… Why did they treat our injuries We’re intruders and also their enemy There shouldn’t be any reason for the Soul Society to treat us The situation has changed Sado I overheard the guard talking and found out Apparently, a Captain was assassinated within the Seireitei The culprit is unknown What So we’re the prime suspects in the case We’ve been kept alive for their investigation That’s what it means If only my Spiritual Pressure wasn’t sealed with these things We could bust right out of here with my Seppa right away I see… These seal the Spiritual Pressure Too strong of a flame, and you will burn yourself Sanreishuto… you must never remove this glove If you remove the glove, for a moment you will gain enormous powers, however… you will surely lose all your Quincy powers as well No Even without this, my Spiritual Pressure’s already… Anyway! Although we did survive, we’re stuck in this prison with our Spiritual Pressure sealed, and it really sucks! However, one thing’s for sure As long as the enemy has no intention of killing us, the rest of the gang is sure to be alive as well! Seeing that we are captured like this, we can assume that Orihime, who’s not suited for combat, is probably detained somewhere as well That leaves just Yoruichi and Ichigo I will wait for Ichigo Ichigo will come here without fail What we can do until then is heal our wounds and prepare for the next battle Let’s wait for Ichigo! Eighteenth sword… That’s it! The real one… has to be this! Too weak! As I’ve said All these swords represent a piece of your heart The purpose of this trial is to find the one piece among these that was forged just for combat alone That one there was your “heart’s frailty” for trying to depend on me Frailty…my being prone to depending …heart As long as you cannot even discern that, don’t dare mention the word “Bankai!” So these are all my weaknesses… Damn it! Well! Next one, Ichigo! You dont have time to be kneeling! Yeah… That’s right! Happy people Come on, come on, come on Happy people Here we go! Everybody stand up! Everybody fight! Within your heart, you may feel uneasy But keep your head right up! To the sky! No matter when (Oh yeah!) No matter where (Oh yeah!) Just call me anytime! (Oh yeah!) I’ll be here for you Happy people in the house!!! With a tough smile Happy people in the house!!! Let’s live! Wow Happy people in the house All right Happy people The food was bad in the Squad Six jail Squad Threes jail didnt get any sunlight Squad Fives jail had cockroaches! Theres definitely room for improvement You guys dont seem to get why you were put in jail! – Why dont you try it, Shiro-chan – I will not!"

It’s begun! Maintain barrier strength! During practice, it’s common for the real thing to attack! Right! This is a safe zone, though This is part of our own training, too Don’t let your guard down! Right, right Crap! Hinamori! Coming your way! Hado 31 Shakkaho, Red Flame Cannon! Kira! Kira! Abarai! Easier than I expected It was our teamwork No one could’ve done it alone Stupid!

Hakufuku… Hakufuku… Hinamori is a master of the Kido If we truly wished to restrain her, we should have sealed her Spiritual Pressure But that wasn’t done because no one expected her to go this far It’s not like she was under a death sentence Why… There’s only one reason… Matsumoto… Yes Go back without me I’m going to save Hinamori!

Wha… Huh Lay down your sword, Ichigo The first day is over This way, sir This is…! I couldn’t tell it was night, already You can’t tell time here, so you sure get disoriented Wh-What’s with this hot spring! My scar’s healing like crazy! Huh Awesome! Just awesome!

And why do you take off your pants first! You always react exactly as expected You’re so naïve Sh-Shut up! You makin’ fun of me! Agh! Don’t come in! N-No! There’s no problem now, is there What Are you a little disappointed Be honest Eh You creep! I’m gonna drown you! Hey, Yoruichi… What I’ve been thinking… This place looks a lot like that place… The Training Ground under Urahara’s Shop I suppose so That place was modeled after this one Really Yeah When Kisuke and I were kids, we secretly built it as our secret play ground Secretly… This hu-ge space…secretly It’s an old story When we were kids, we played here almost every day… After he joined the Thirteen Court Guard Squads, and I joined the Stealth Force, we honed our skills here W-Wait a minute, Yoruichi! Yow! Why sit cross-legged! Don’t sit like that! Heh I never get tired of that reaction Just tell me more about the old guy! So he was a Soul Reaper, after all Yep I thought it was strange He knew so much about Soul Society and he had a zanpaku-to Tell me, Yoruichi Who is he, anyway He’s the former captain of Squad 12 of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads He even founded and served as the first chief of the Department of Research and Development For real! Didn’t know he was that important! I thought so… What! Are you trying to kill me! I have a good stomach medicine that works wonderfully Please wait! You are trying to kill me! I’ll dig it out from the back yard! What the heck are they doing So you’re together, as I suspected Captain Hitsugaya…! Just as I thought Only Kira’s cell was unlocked from the outside If you wanted it to be a secret, weren’t you a little careless …Ichimaru Well, that’s a funny thing to say I did it on purpose, so you’d know It’s a good thing I got here before Hinamori Before she gets here, I’ll kill you! Hinamori! At last…I’ve found you So you were here… No, Hinamori! You’re no match for him! I’ll handle this Stay back! Hinamori… To avenge…Captain Aizen! Why did you kill the Captain…! I know everything… from this letter left by the captain Hinamori, the true purpose for this execution is not to kill Rukia Kuchiki This execution was contrived in order to steal a certain object Its true objective is… The Sokyoku The Sokyoku’s seal is broken only for an execution In its blade lies the destructive power of a million zanpaku-tô It also possesses the defensive ability to block equally powerful zanpaku-to, as well Moreover, when a Soul Reaper is crucified and stabbed with Sokyoku, its power grows dozens of times over The one who plotted this execution plans to use this power to destroy not only the Seireitei, but Soul Society itself And the name of this vile person is… Toshiro…Hitsugaya… Wha--! The letter goes on to say… I’ve called him out to the Sacred Eastern Wall tonight I must stop his plan somehow “I’m resolved to fight him if he won’t desist But if I should die… Hinamori, won’t you carry out my wishes and avenge him This is my final request… not as the captain of Squad 5… but as a man I ask this…of you…!” Hinamori… You fool! Think carefully! If he dies, he wants you to fight instead! Do you think Aizen would say that! The Aizen I know was never stupid enough to face unbeatable odds alone And he was no coward that makes his men bail him out either! But…But that’s what the letter said! In Captain Aizen’s handwriting! I didn’t want to believe it, either! But that’s what Captain Aizen said! I…I… I don’t know… what to do anymore…Shiro-chan… Hinamori… Rats No good She’s too upset to think rationally But Aizen would never write a letter like that Somebody must’ve forged it! So that Hinamori and I would kill each other! I see This, too… Was this all your doing, too! Ichimaru! Hinamori…! Oh, my That was cruel, Squad 10 Captain The girl was hurt and so desperate Why hit her so hard Ichimaru… The warning certainly came… at a convenient time for you What are you after I’ll never forget what you said back then You’re always the same You should stop and listen to the last alarm, at least Soon you won’t be able to anymore So Aizen wasn’t enough for you… You even had to hurt Hinamori this bad…! To make her grip her sword so hard that her hands bled…! Whatever are you talking about I told you… If you ever made Hinamori bleed, I’d kill you! That will never do Draw your sword in a place like this and I’ll be forced to stop you Happy people Come on, come on, come on Happy people Here we go! Everybody stand up! Everybody fight! Within your heart, you may feel uneasy But keep your head right up! To the sky! No matter when (Oh yeah!) No matter where (Oh yeah!) Just call me anytime! (Oh yeah!) I’ll be here for you Happy people in the house!!! With a tough smile Happy people in the house!!! Let’s live!

Where’d Yoruichi go, though I wanna get started soon Can he achieve Bankai in only two days going like this Maybe I should extend the deadline… According to the information I gathered, after Rukia had entered the Seireitei, her execution grace period was cut five days short to 25 days So after Ichigo’s three days of training, the execution would’ve been the following day We had no time to spare But for good or bad, when we came here, we were chased by a Cleaner in the Senkaimon, and tore through the Dangai Precipice World That shifted the time axis in our favor when we fell into Soul Society In other words, even after our three days of training, we’ll still have eight more days! It’s possible to extend the training! But what do we do… Kisuke developed that training program based on himself The only one ever to succeed was Kisuke himself! Yoruichi! Moreover, the 3-day period is what it took for Kisuke to achieve Bankai And he determined that a longer time period would be dangerous Yoruichi…! He said… Don’t worry! Mr Kurosaki’s natural abilities are greater than mine! So I believed him and began training Ichigo Hey! Yoruichi! But there’s no guarantee that Ichigo’s soul can withstand the longer training period HEY! Yoruichi! Come on out, I said! Hah! Or are ya so scared of me that you ran away! I’ll wait one more day… And if there’s still no change in his spiritual power, I’ll just have to risk it… What did you say Did you not hear Then I shall repeat the notice Your date of execution has been changed once more, Ms Rukia Kuchiki The execution will take place tomorrow If you hadn’t come, Hinamori would’ve been dead Thanks, Matsumoto No… Wait, Ichimaru! Instead of coming after me… Look after the Lieutenant of Squad 5 He always disappears without telling me where he’s going… a bad habit That still hasn’t changed Gin… Where are you trying to go That letter of Aizen’s… How much of it was forged Captain Aizen…! The power of Sokyoku that is going to be released at Rukia Kuchiki’s execution… The plot to use that power to destroy Soul Society… Was that line true If it is true… If that’s what Ichimaru is after… I’ll… Hell Butterfly… Reporting to the Captains and Lieutenants A change has been made concerning the execution date for prisoner Rukia Kuchiki The execution will take place 29 hours from now This ruling is final There will be no further changes That is all Captain! The execution and the release of Sokyoku’s power… If that’s Ichimaru’s aim, I can’t let this execution proceed Come with me, Matsumoto We’re stopping the execution To all Captains and Lieutenants, reporting… a final change in the execution date of prisoner Rukia Kuchiki The execution will take place 29 hours from now I repeat There has been a final change in the execution date of prisoner Rukia Kuchiki The execution will take place 29 hours from now This ruling is final There will be no further changes There’s no mistake That’s his Spiritual Pressure… He seems to be making steady progress But what’s this sense of unease that I’m feeling Something… I sense something ominous approaching I was wondering what you were doing, holed up in here That’s your zanpaku-to’s true form Secretly training for Bankai That looks like fun… Lemme train, too Renji! “What’re you doing here” That’s the look you’re giving me Hell, no special reason We’re outta time So I just wanted someplace where I could concentrate on training Out of…time Whaddya mean Well, okay I guess Ill tell you… They changed Rukia’s time of execution What! The new time is noon tomorrow! I hate to admit it but my powers now ain’t good enough to save Rukia That’s why I came here Don’t worry I ain’t gonna mess with your training I’ve already mastered manifesting it Only a little more until Bankai I’m just gonna do my own thing T-Tomorrow… But…he’ll never reach Bankai by then Are you just gonna quit, Yoruichi Weren’t you the one who started me on this training Then don’t be the first one to give up! But Ichigo, if you can’t reach Bankai by tomorrow… I told you…! Don’t talk about “can’t” If tomorrow’s the deadline… We’ll just finish it today! His Spiritual Pressure…! This guy…! So tomorrow is the execution… I know… Before the execution, I’ll ask that Ichigo and the others be allowed to return to the World of the Living I belong to the Kuchiki clan, after all They might allow it The execution is tomorrow… When I heard that, I was surprised, but strangely enough I wasn’t sad It must be because of the dream I had last night That dream about the night I’ll never forget Sir Kaien…! Sir Kaien! Sir Kaien! Sir Kaien! Sir Kaien…! Sir Kaien! Happy people Come on, come on, come on Happy people Here we go! Everybody stand up! Everybody fight! Within your heart, you may feel uneasy But keep your head right up! To the sky! No matter when (Oh yeah!) No matter where (Oh yeah!) Just call me anytime! (Oh yeah!) I’ll be here for you Happy people in the house!!! With a tough smile Happy people in the house!!! Let’s live!

Who are we to pass through you Whoa! That answer will find you someday The execution is tomorrow… When I heard that, I was surprised, but… strangely enough I wasn’t sad It must be because of the dream I had last night… That dream about the night I’ll never forget Please wait here a moment The captain shall be arriving soon Um Yes! What is it! I’m just an ordinary new squad member Could you please address me less formally Ah… Yes! I’ll be careful in the future! Who’s that girl You know, from the Kuchiki clan… Hah! A new pet cat, huh I heard she was exempt from the graduation exam as well as the squad entrance exam… Just a pastime for the great nobles… They’ve got to be kidding! We’re here busting our butts… It’s the same here, after all … Hey, hey! What are you guys doing loitering around here This isn’t a show! Get back to your posts, damn it! I’m the Lieutenant, Kaien Shiba! Nice to meet ya! Umm… Yes, sir… “Umm… Yes, sir…” What’s with that greeting! Your Lieutenant just introduced himself! You’re supposed to state your name and say, “Pleased to meet you too, sir,” right! What’s your name, damn it! I’m Ru…Rukia Kuchiki, sir Oh… And P-Pleased to meet you too, sir! Good! All right, Rukia! An ordinary greeting, an ordinary yelling, an ordinary subordinate-superior relationship… I welcome you to the Squad 13! Our captain isn’t in the best of health, so I’m pretty much in charge of things here! So I wouldn’t mind if you sometimes call me “Captain Kaien” by mistake! Umm, I’ll think about it But that ordinariness was, without doubt, just what I was seeking Brother, my squad entrance process was completed without incident What Seat are you Ah…well… My deepest apologies… With my abilities, I’m afraid… I couldn’t get an officer’s seat upon entry… I see You may leave What’s with the long face, you! Eek! What’s with you Every time you see me, you go “Eek!” You’re going to hurt my feelings Hey, here’s your share, drink up! Y-yes, sir… Knowing you, even if I asked why you’re depressed you probably wouldn’t tell me… Don’t you forget this As long as you’re a member of this squad, I’m on your side no matter what So cool! You stink! Wow! You’re so cool, Sir Kaien! You stink! You stink! Did you hear that “I’m on your side” “On your side!” Gotta love him, huh! Got him wrapped around your finger! Kiyone! Sentaro! You guys went off and got drunk again didn’t you, damn it! Kuchiki! Don’t let it bother you! I’m from Rukon District, too! When I first came here, there were those who gave me a hard time about it! But for snot-heads like that, you just have to rub the snot right back at ‘em! Snot-heads! How annoying! What a bunch of loudmouthed drunks! You guys need to come back to your senses! Sir Kaien, you’re too rough sir, too rough! Shut up! You’re still on the clock, damn it! Oh, don’t be a square! I felt comfortable…being by Sir Kaien Take this! Well done! As always, Sir Kaien! Our Lieutenant took it down! Mission accomplished! Ah-Ouch… Lady Miyako… Are you all right Y-Yes, it’s nothing really! I see… That’s good He—y! He—y! Hey, Miyako, I didn’t know you were here Just in case you let the Hollow get away I thought I should come to take care of things I wouldn’t get beaten that easily! Kuchiki, sorry, but could you call Sentaro and Kiyone We’re pulling out! Yes, sir! Lady Miyako, thank you very much Take care Yes! Sir Kaien had a wife… Although a woman, she had risen to the rank of the 3rd seat Despite being a woman warrior, she was intelligent, kind…and beautiful… I admired her… I wanted to be like her… She was my ideal… Then one day, Lady Miyako received orders for a reconnaissance mission It seems we don’t know a thing about this Hollow None of the Soul Reapers attacked by it has survived Don’t get reckless My, I never thought I’d hear those words from you Quit kidding around I cannot forgive a Hollow that disturbs a soul’s peace As a Soul Reaper of the proud Thirteen Court Guard Squads, I must stop their evil deeds Lady Miyako… Don’t worry It’s just a reconnaissance mission I’ll leave the rest to you guys Well then, we’ll be going Are you all right Yes… Don’t worry Excuse me Kuchiki, any report from the reconnaissance team yet No sir, they still have not returned I-It’s terrible! The reconnaissance team! Miyako! She’s unconscious, but her life is not in danger And the rest They’re all dead All dead… Sir Kaien… This sure is terrible… The entire reconnaissance team’s dead, except for Lady Miyako…! Is Lady Miyako all right Yeah… They said that her life’s not in danger Well, that’s good… She’s definitely someone that Squad 13 couldn’t do without Yeah… Hm My, Lady Miyako, should you be up already Wh-What’s happening! Lady Miyako… What was that! La…dy… Miyako… What, what happened here! Oh, no…! Stop it, Miyako! O-Oh, no! What in the world… Sir Kaien… Captain… She couldn’t have gone very far yet Wait, Kaien! Hold it! If you chase her now, you’re doing exactly what the enemy wants you to do! But still, I must go It controlled Miyako, and used her to kill off those subordinates who cared for her It sullied her pride Please let me go…Captain! Fine Then I shall go with you Captain… Rukia, you come too! Yes, sir! You two, take command of this place and prepare the battle stations! Understood! Let’s go! I smell them… The smell…of those foolish prey… That’s…! Kaien! Sir Kaien, I’ll go first and check it out… Captain…I beg of you Please let me go by myself Okay… So you are the first, eh! Boy! Hey, you…! How many Soul Reapers have you eaten so far I wonder…how many… Sorry, but I don’t remember the count Have you regretted it…even once That’s a silly question, boy I too, like you, have a heart There isn’t a night that I don’t have regrets after eating a Soul Reaper Even now, I’m having regrets… I was just regretting that I should have used that woman Soul Reaper more before consuming her So you controlled Miyako and made her kill her comrades… Controlled No, not quite At that time, I was inside that woman It’s too bad… that I couldn’t show you the part where I devoured that woman to revert to this form… Want to come Come! Come, come! I’ll eat you up! You’re fast! But… You touched me! Rankle the seas and the skies! Nejibana! What! You fell for it…! When someone touches my feelers, their zanpaku-to vanishes! That’s impossible! Never heard of such a power… Sir Kaien! Captain! But, why! We must help Sir Kaien! If we help him, what will become of his pride If you help him now, it will probably save his life However, at the same time, you will surely be killing his pride forever So, what about his pride What’s pride compared to one’s life Listen well, and remember this There are two types of battles, and as long as we place ourselves in battle, we must always be aware of the difference between the two Battles to protect lives and… battles to protect pride…! Right now, he is fighting for pride! His subordinates’ pride… His own pride… And above all… for his beloved wife’s pride… What’s the matter Aren’t you going to ask your friends for help Shut up…! I can handle you all by myself! Is that so Then I shall do unto you the same as I did unto your beloved wife I will control your body from within, and against your will I shall slay your comrades! Amusing, isn’t it Sir…Kaien… What is it… Did you call me, girl Sir Kaien… Why do you keep calling my name Are you that worried about me Are you that much… in love with me, girl If you love me that much…then… I shall eat you first! Captain… Run, Rukia Hurry up! Do you want to die! Why… Why did this have to happen…! Why… Sir Kaien…! What’s the matter Why won’t you attack me! I know why! You’re thinking of a way to drag me out of this body, aren’t you! It’s useless! I am a spirit being, and he is a spirit being Now our spirits are united It can never be undone! I see… Then you leave me no choice I shall kill you along with Kaien’s body! Damn you! Are you crazy You’re going to kill your own man! Yes, I will I cannot allow the likes of you to possess Kaien’s body! You won’t get away! At a time like this… You idiot! Why did you come back! At the time I came back, I didn’t even have a plan Captain… Thank you so much… For letting me…fight… Yeah… S-Sir Kaien Did you…intentionally… Rukia… I made you go along with my selfish request… and put you through a horrible time… Sorry about that, it must have been harsh… Thanks to you… I can leave my heart here… No… I haven’t done a single thing to be thanked for… The only person I saved was myself… I’m detestable… I’m not worthy of being saved… I’m not worth shedding blood over…ever… Byakuya! It’s terrible! Rukia’s execution has… I heard I see, then… And what about it What did you say The execution is tomorrow If that’s the decision, then I simply obey it Do not interrupt me with such needless talk Excuse me H-hey, you! Enough joking around! It really is tomorrow! At tomorrow noon, your sister will be… Don’t get so excited You’ll shorten your life, Ukitake You’ve already let one of your men die before, haven’t you In any case, she is a member of my house Whether she dies or gets killed, it’s none of your business I would like you to refrain from any rash actions Happy people Come on, come on, come on Happy people Here we go!

" Pain that won’t heal Sadness you feel Scars that just refuse to fade from memory Sometimes the burden’s too much for one to bear Don’t give up on me, please don’t turn me away Whoa! I’ll hold your hand in mine Will I lose my hold on her someday Will her smile fade in a flood of tears Or can I keep the fears at bay Echoing, distant voices wither into silence But there is one thing that will never ever age… My love for you is timeless Pain that won’t heal Sadness you feel Smiles with hearts’ bitterness replaced “I’ll never smile again” “I’ll never let love in” Don’t ever say such things to me A future we cannot see All happenings Find meaning in the story In time the clouds will clear away, so just stay, please stay with me… Whoa! Who are we to pass through you Whoa! That answer will find you someday THREE I’m tired… I drank too much… Damn Idiot! It’s not the sake’s fault, is it It’s all those cigarettes you smoke! Huh Shuddup! Don’t try to pick a fight with me just because you lost yesterday, old man! You want me to kill you What! Bring it on! Draw your sword! I’ll sweep you up before I sweep the streets! Sweep me up Who the hell talks like that anymore! Die old man…! Huh What-- What is that sound – Good morning, Captain Zaraki…! – Good morning, Captain Zaraki…! Thank you for giving us the honor of sweeping the streets… If you two are gonna goof off try not to be so obvious about it, idiots! If you leave even a little piece of lint, I’ll kill you Gentlemen! Do your best! Why’s that bastard Aramaki accompanying the Captain More importantly, weren’t there two people riding on the Captain’s back… So… Which way now, woman Um… Probably… It’s this way! That hurt! What was that for, Yachiru! That wasn’t very nice You think it’s this way too Right, Kenny Maybe you should leave it up to Orihime The Lieutenant’s probing ability is a pretty good match to Captain’s… Shut up, you pinball! I’ll kill her… Come on, keep your cool… Anyway, you were kind of asking for that one Oh, whatever… I’m just going to go with my instincts All right! You go, Kenny! FOUR Oh… A butterfly has just flew in How cute… Heh-heh… I wonder if it’s spring here He sees a butterfly and talks to himself It must be terminal You can go chase after it, if you want, Uryu D-Don’t tease me! I don’t chase butterflies! Anyway, I wish you wouldn’t call me by my first name I don’t remember being on such friendly terms with you! What! I don’t remember being on friendly terms with you, either! In that case, don’t use my first name Anyway, you’re acting too friendly Being friendly is part of the Shiba clan legacy – You got a problem Stupid fool! – I’ve never heard of such legacy! Shh! – What – What’s wrong Can’t you hear that Now that you mention it… What are you doing! He’s gone mad! Gone mad! Don’t you think they’re steadily headed this way It reminds me of a scene out of a typical samurai drama… It’s sto--! W-What What What’s going on! What is this! Y-You are…! I-Its…! Kenpachi Zaraki, Captain of the Squad 11! Oh… You! You’re the bowl-cut narcissist pervert from that time! And you are… I’m sorry, but I can’t remember ugly faces What did you say! Let me tell you, after I got bandaged up, everyone tells me I’ve gotten more handsome! And besides how could you recognize me with my face covered! Idiot! So, he doesn’t deny being ugly… I-Inoue! Ishida! Sado! Ganju! You’re all safe! I’m so glad! Yachiru…! Please stop that! Fall…! Fall down! Master Byakuya… It is time Please get ready to leave for the Sokyoku All right… I’m off, Hisana… This is awful…! I beg your pardon, my Captain! This Tetsuzaemon Iba fell asleep sitting on the toilet! I shall kill myself to atone… Never mind… The preparations have all been made Don’t try to be responsible for everything, Tetsuzaemon Uh N-No…I didn’t mean… Don’t hide it You’re worried, aren’t you That I might still have doubts about this execution… And that’s why you have been trying to buy some time, so that I can think it through until I’m convinced, right So you knew… Don’t worry I have no doubts My loyalty and dedication to Head Captain Yamamoto are absolute Despised and made an outcast because of my appearance, he was the only one who believed in me I would spend the whole of my spirit to repay that debt to him I have no doubts If he approves of it, even death is right! What about you… Tosen… Of course, I am the same as always These sightless eyes see only the paths not dyed red with blood… I believe that you and I walk the same path, Komamura Two What an annoyance! What a pain! It’s bad enough that we have trouble with the Ryoka sneaking in, and then some kind of a murder happening… Now we’ve got some people arguing whether the execution is right or not! It’s the decision of the superiors, so there’s no sense in arguing it! Are they idiots, or what! Don’t you think so, Captain Ridiculous… Huh I have no interest in right and wrong nor good and bad All I have are the pride as a captain of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads and the missions to accomplish I kill enemies… That’s all there is Oh Is that right You too, Omaeda… Don’t misread where you should stand Don’t forget… If you cross me… you too are my enemy Yeah… I’ll remember that… Captain! I was looking all over for you Don’t just lie there You must hurry and prepare yourself! Nanao… I have a little problem… Will you listen to it What is it You see, I put this blade of grass in my mouth thinking it’d make me look cool… but I guess it was poisonous or something The inside of my mouth is burning… Spit it out! Nanao… What do you think I should do Why are you asking me No matter what I say… you always do just as you wish Don’t worry I’ll walk a few steps behind you so I wouldn’t get mixed up in any trouble Oh, dear… Then I’ll be the only one again… to get scolded by Old Man Yamamoto Huh… What… Uh…well… How should I put it Guiding someone, you almost need luck… Sure, you could run into dead-ends ten or twenty times before finding your way, right See Didn’t I tell you That’s why I said I didn’t want the Lieutenant to lead the way! Ouch…! Hey, Lieutenant! She’s biting! She’s really biting me! Captain… Yeah… Being sneaky like that… A shameful bunch, you are Show yourselves Hiding your Spiritual Pressure to hide yourself is no way for a captain to act You have the nerve to talk like that Are you aware of what you are doing Where are you running off to with these Ryoka Did you lose your self-respect when you were defeated, Zaraki C-Captain Komamura… Captain Tosen… Lieutenant Iba… Lieutenant Hisagi…! Don’t lose your head, Aramaki! We still outnumber them I-It’s not a matter of numbers! Quit whining Who said I’d let you fight Four to one That’s not really enough to test my blade on Four to one, you say Are you saying you’ll take on the four of us yourself I know how good you are But, I think you’re being a little too sure of yourself, Kenpachi Zaraki! You talk too much Just hurry up and fight already! I’d rather have all of you at once… May be if you attack me from all four sides… then one of you might actually be able to cut me! Uh…Captain Zaraki… What should we do… You’ll get in my way Get lost! He didn’t have to put it that way… Come on, Whiskers… Kenny looks so happy You mustn’t get in his way! Whiskers… You changed my nickname Kenny! We’ll continue on our search for Ichigo, okay! Yeah… I’ll be right there Jiggles, Muscles, Monkey, Pencil! Let’s get going! Oh, but… Pencil Is that me… – Never mind…just hurry up! – O-Ouch, Yachiru! – You’re going to pull my arm out! – Running is awesome! “I’ll be right there,” huh Are you trying to provoke us Or do you really believe it Either way, it looks like you’ve lost not only your pride, but your sanity, too, Zaraki Humph! Sanity Sorry, but I’ve never had a such bothersome thing from the start! Yachiru, wait! Yachiru! Huh… Are you sure it was okay to leave Mr Zaraki by himself… Of course! No matter who his opponent is, there’s no way Kenny would lose! Yachiru… That girl…! She fears nothing… calling the Lieutenant by her first name Right What do you think of that, Third Seat Madarame Huh Captain, in this situation… Please allow us to go first Stupid… I told you four to come at me together, didn’t I I knew it! Underestimating us…! In that case, there’s no choice but for us two to go, right, Captain Wait a minute! Why arent you on your way  with the rest of the group Listen up, you there! Dont you dare expect that you mere lieutenants can  go up against our captain! I should be enough for  someone like you, damn it! Right, Captain~ In other words you two  want in on the fight Oh, well Ill give them over to you,  so take the fight elsewhere If you get in my way, Ill  get rid fo you two first -Roger!/N-Roger! Well Well Fighting over whos gonna give or not give, whether youre gonna take us on or not In the short time I havent  seen you, youve grown cocky, Ikkaku! A coward who transferred to another squad just because he couldnt  become a lieutenant in ours has no right to lecture  me about how to talk, Iba! Ikkaku Anyway, we can talk later  Were moving away from here I have no wish to be killed  by our captain, you see Same here Im getting out of here,  too  You dont mind do you Do whatever you want Itll be the same anyway Well, now We can finally  get down to business thought the number has been cut in half But I guess its probably good  enough to wake me up at the least You still talk Thats why I say your just too arrogant! Here I come! Take two steps back, Komamura I will break all his limbs Suzumushi Nishiki Benihiko Its over Not even Kenpachi Zaraki could  have possibly survived this What Is that it No-No way! How can he still be standing aftering being hit by my Tenken  and Tosens Benihiko My, my I take back what I just said This wont even wake me up Well, I guess Ill be going Yeah Yoruichi Will he really be all right Were out of time Can he really reach Bankai today Lets go, Ichigo One more time! Letm e make this clear  Just  because the time in drawing near, I have no intention of going easy on you Of course not! I dont intend to let you do that either! Renji Do you remember the first  time you stood up and walked Huh Of course, I dont remember! If you dont remember it, it means youre not conscious about it If thats the case, why did you stand up Humans beings are born  knowing how to stand up All Birds know how to fly And fish know how to swim That is called Instinct Because it is a natural instinct, What is what I am reminded of He probably knows instinctively that he has that power That is why I believe that he will be the one to reach Bankai! Happy people Come on, come on, come on Happy people Here we go! Everybody stand up! Everybody fight! Within your heart, you may feel uneasy But keep your head right up! To the sky! No matter when (Oh yeah!) No matter where (Oh yeah!) Just call me anytime! (Oh yeah!) I’ll be here for you Happy people in the house!!! With a tough smile Happy people in the house!!! Let’s live! Wow Happy people in the house All right Happy people Yo! How is everybody doing  I am your idol, Kon! This is the last installment  of the Soul Reaper Guide Book! Last on the list is that legendary man! The new Illustrated Guided  to Soul Reapers Golden Will begin right after the  next episode! Stay tuned! You mean theres more! "
" You are my one and only No one can take your place Never fade, my only flower The sun never blinds you You are like a flower that blooms in shade Exhale those feelings you hold inside You are my one and only; now and forever The day may come when all will rise against us, but I will protect you Never give up, my only flower TIME NOTICE THAT YOU SHOULD NOTICE THAT NOTICE THAT THERE’S NO OTHER To have fought this much, and still be standing is admirable But the fact is that you have yet to reach Bankai Do you wish to continue, Ichigo Why do you even bother asking such a stupid question I don’t have time Come at me with all you’ve got! Very well! Let’s do it, Ichigo! P-Please stop! Lieutenant! Please put down your sword! Lieutenant Abarai! R-Renji… Why are you doing this Just a little farther… just a little… Just a little while longer now and I can be there to save you I will never let them execute you! This…Spiritual Pressure… Captain Kuchiki… Where are you going, Renji I’m going to…save Rukia No I’m going! You refuse to let me pass no matter what I don’t intend to repeat myself He’s coming! Senka A special Flash Step with a spin, where you get behind your opponent to destroy his Soul Chain and Soul Sleep at the same time I’ve seen it countless times It’s your favorite move I knew your moves logically But now my body is fast enough to counter you, at last Captain Kuchiki! You can no longer kill me with that sword! You talk a lot What makes you so confident You think you countered my sword with that level of skill Scatter I told you… You can’t kill me with that sword anymore! It’s not just since I became your lieutenant… Long before I even joined the Thirteen Court Guard Squads… The one I wanted to surpass… was always you, Captain Kuchiki! You released your zanpakuto without calling its name Does this mean that you I will surpass you, Captain Kuchiki… There’s no more time… and your body has reached its limits If you continue, you may die before you reach the Bankai Do you still wish to continue, Ichigo Ban…kai! Hihio Zabimaru You… when did you achieve Bankai Of course, you wouldn’t have noticed Not someone like you who never pays attention to anybody below him I’ll say it again! I’m going to save Rukia! I said I wouldn’t repeat myself If you won’t let me pass… I’ll take you down and go! Impossible You won’t be able to make me fall on even one knee I see… its pressure is at the level of Bankai for sure However, it isn’t enough Scatter… Senbonzakura! Senbonzakura… A thousand blades, each too small for the eye to see When the blades fly, they turn and reflect the sunlight, resembling a thousand flower petals falling I know it Unfortunately for you, my sword’s joints are connected by my Spiritual Pressure Your blades can’t cut through them! Just now, I purposely disconnected the joints… in order to counter all of your thousand blades Why’re you so surprised I’m just telling you… I can see your sword! I got you down on your knee! I will defeat you! Let’s bring down the curtain, Byakuya Kuchiki On the battle between you and me Bring down the curtain… Very well Then I shall bring down the curtain with my sword What! The sword that ends this… will be mine! Hado 33 Sokatsui! He’s discarded the incantation! He can do this much damage with a mid-level Kido without Spirit Chant! You’re naïve! You thought that I’d lose sight of you with this Damn! I lost control! You’re the one that’s naïve I didn’t release my Kido in order to obscure my movements from you I did it to interrupt the rhythm of your Bankai The weakness of Bankai lies in its sheer size reflecting its Spiritual Pressure Because of its shape and size that surpasses the norm of a blade, in order to control all of its movements completely, one must have over a decade of training after learning Bankai Renji, you are not ready to use your Bankai in battle So what I already knew all of that when I came here Luckily, my zanpakuto is pretty tough! Losing a joint changes nothing! Bakudo 61, Rikujokoro Damn! You should have simply put your sword down Do you still think you can defeat me Surely, you haven’t forgotten That I too have Bankai Bankai Scatter Senbonzakura Kageyoshi! A thousand blades that rise from the ground… With their scattering, infinitely more blades then rise Impossible to know their numbers Impossible to even read their path, much less avoid them Nothing to do but watch, as one watches the wind pass One can do nothing but stand there frozen, and then be swept away from this world Shall I tell you the difference between you and me It’s class A beast may see the moon reflected on the water’s surface But trying to capture it will only result in sinking into the water Your fang will never reach me… Never But be proud of the fact that you were felled by this blade yet you still retain a human form So you can still breathe Do not move You will only hasten your death It’s not over… I can still…fight! Did you not hear me I told you not to move I shall compliment you You received my Bankai and are still alive However, if you move again, I will not go easy on you My blades will carve you into pieces You must have noticed Your Bankai is gone When one’s Bankai disappears against its master’s will, it means the master’s end is near Soon, you will fade away I shall ask you this once more Will you still speak nonsense about saving Rukia I can’t breathe… It’s like the Spiritual Pressure is turning me into ash I can’t even lift a finger… I can’t… In the end… this man and I were too far apart, after all Will you still stand, Ichigo Of course! What I swore… …that I’d save her! Swore To whom No one… Just on… Just on… – my soul! – my soul! Stronger than Byakuya Kuchiki What a goal you have You’d better just stay away from her from now on She understands, too That she’s different from us It’s so complicated Isn’t it annoying It’s always a lot harder to draw, than to tear it And It’s much harder to tie than to unravel Dammit… Admirable Your fang… definitely reached me Renji No way… Until now, it was so powerful, I couldn’t figure out whose it was… The Spiritual Pressure that just faded… definitely belonged to Renji! Why Why did you… Renji! Good morning How are you, Rukia Gin…Ichimaru! All the days gone by have made me what I am Life’s not easy; that’s why I can go on To the people hurrying by, “Have your dreams come true” I’m still struggling… Forget returning to my youth; I want to live today well I was born timid Out where the sun shines I fisted my hand tight Break out of that place, that time, and I can change my life But I could never express everything deep in my heart Life’s not easy; that’s why I can go on The rules of Squad 11! One, your zanpakuto must be a direct attack type! One, if you must die, die gloriously in a fight! One, obey the Lieutenant’s orders at all costs! – Now, wait a minute! – Now, wait a minute! Any complaints, Shiny Duo! – No giving us a duo nickname! – No giving us a duo nickname! Squad 10 Captain, Toshiro Hitsugaya! You are so stuck up! Squad 13 Captain, Jushiro Ukitake! Your long hair is against the rules! Squad 6 Lieutenant, Renji Abarai! Hey, are you challenging me! Squad 6 Captain, Byakuya Kuchiki! You are so cool… Squad 5 Captain, Sosuke Aizen! Do those glasses have lenses in them Squad 3 Captain, Gin Ichimaru! Wipe that smirk off your face!"
" You are my one and only No one can take your place Never fade, my only flower The sun never blinds you You are like a flower that blooms in shade Exhale those feelings you hold inside You are my one and only; now and forever The day may come when all will rise against us, but I will protect you Never give up, my only flower TIME NOTICE THAT YOU SHOULD NOTICE THAT NOTICE THAT THERE’S NO OTHER Renji… Why Why you… Renji! Good morning How are you, Rukia Gin…Ichimaru… Now, now… Such bad manners as usual You must always address me as Captain Ichimaru If you don’t change your attitude, you’ll get a scolding from your brother I apologize, Captain Ichimaru Oh no Did you think I was serious Don’t worry I won’t turn you in I don’t mind it from you Why… Why have you come to a place like this, Captain Ichimaru Oh… no particular reason I was out taking a walk and thought I’d visit… just to tease you a little bit I never liked this man Shortly before I joined the Thirteen Court Guard Squads, my brother became the Captain of Squad 6 This man became the Captain of Squad 3 about the same time I remember him chatting with my brother whenever they happened to meet… It didn’t look like anything other than two captains exchanging pleasantries There was never anything of any substance said However, it didn’t look that way to me From the first time I laid eyes on this man, I broke out in a cold sweat all over my body His fingertips…his lips… Even the slight movement of his eyes… reminded me of a snake And although he was speaking to my brother, I felt as though he had his hands around my throat and I was frozen, unable even to blink I’ve always hated this man It seemed like he could find the smallest crack in those around him and seep deep down into you like venom That’s the kind of fear he arouses… I didn’t have any reason for it Something inside me rejected everything about him Despite the many times we’ve spoken over the years, those feelings have never changed… Even now… I still feel that way about him What’s the matter You’re in such a daze Nothing… Oh, by the way, it seems he isn’t actually dead yet… Abarai, that is It’s true… I can vaguely sense something like Renji’s spirit energy… But it’s so weak… He will die soon Poor thing All he did was try to save you, Rukia Don’t speak so lightly of him! Are you afraid Wh-What You don’t want Abarai and the others to die, do you Thinking about not wanting them dead… don’t you suddenly feel afraid of dying Want me to save you C-Captain Ichimaru! What… What are you saying, sir! Well I could save you this instant if I wanted to You and Abarai…and the others Is he serious What could he gain from saving me! And there’s even less reason for him to want to save Ichigo and Renji! But…does he really mean it Just kidding Bye-bye, Rukia I’ll see you at the Sokyoku I thought I had abandoned all hope I thought I lost my reasons for living… I had no regrets I had no fear of death… Yet…he was able to shake my resolve! By holding out that small sliver of hope, he managed to make me yearn just a bit… He made me want to live again! He shattered my resolve! Quit fretting… over something like this! Tosen! What are you looking around for, idiot! This is ridiculous! How can you call yourselves captains with that level of strength! Come on and stand up You don’t look dead to me yet At least die after releasing your Bankai Don’t get so full of yourself! A traitor like you isn’t worthy of Bankai! Hold it, Komamura I’ll do it There are three ways to become a captain in the Thirteen Court Guard Squads… The first is to pass the Captain’s Exam, presided over by three other captains, including the Head Captain himself The second way is to receive the recommendation of six or more captains, and be acknowledged by at least three of the remaining seven captains The third way is to defeat the previous captain in a one-on-one battle, which must be witnessed by two hundred or more squad members So what’s your point Kenpachi Zaraki… Ever since the moment you killed the former captain of Squad 11 and replaced him, I’ve felt a deep unease about you, unease that has become a certainty… A certainty that you’re a demon… that you thrive on violence and blood… that you’re different from the rest of us And that you were bound someday to destroy the peace And sure enough Now you have saved the Ryoka and here you fight against us, threatening to bring even more chaos to the Seireitei And all because of your insatiable bloodlust and your love of fighting for its own sake Am I wrong Enough babbling So you’re claiming to be the hero of justice Get to the point If you hate me so much, just attack! No hatred I never actually said that I hated you I just find you unforgivable! Everything that you say and do… threatens the very peace we have established! I do not hate you However, I must erase you in the name of peace! Tosen! Bankai! Suzumushi Tsuishiki Enmakorogi This is my Bankai This entire space is my Bankai Well Zaraki Even you could not have expected this But… you probably can’t see anything What is this I can’t see a thing I can’t hear a thing What do you think of a world without light or sound Isn’t it frightening The Enmakorogi steals all Spiritual Pressure, all perceptions and senses of those within it and creates a dark, silent hell Only one can escape this hell… the one who wields this Suzumushi It’s useless! You cannot catch me No matter how skilled one may be, when deprived of light so suddenly, it is the end With the sudden darkness, a tiny fear is born The slightest fear slows one down by half a step But I who have known no light since birth… You are a demon, after all You have no fear to begin with Fine! Then, I will not give you any chance to feel fear! It ain’t over yet! Ichigo, there’s no time left I can’t believe my resolve was so weak How depressing That’s Captain Tosen’s Enmakorogi… Is he having a tough battle Or… I’d better get over there fast Not so fast! I haven’t lost yet Don’t kid yourself You’ve lost Sorry to disappoint you In Squad 11, to lose means to die That’s different from Squad 9 Like heaven and earth That’s why we’re fighting Fight, huh But you really should put down your sword There’s no way a fifth seat can defeat a lieutenant Shall I tell you a secret The reason why I’m a fifth seat… is simply because I don’t like the number “four” What I think the number “three” is the prettiest But that belongs to Ikkaku So I chose the fifth seat, “five” being the closest in resemblance to the number “three” And one more thing… In Squad 11, we have an unspoken agreement… Our zanpakuto can only be direct combat type We all live to fight So Kido type of zanpakuto is thought to be for cowards Anyway, the secret begins from here… What is the true power of my zanpakuto Now, don’t tell Ikkaku and the Captain, okay I don’t want them to dislike me Why you--! Am I alive… H-Hello… Why are you tending to me I brought him here Rikichi, you…! Hanataro was captured trying to save Rukia… So I thought he would help you with your injury He waited for a chance to unlock the cell I see Thanks Oh no… Actually… Someone had tended to your wound before I came The only one who could’ve done this… Lieutenant Abarai! Please don’t give up! Ichigo will save Rukia So… Yeah, please don’t give up! I couldn’t believe it That you had lost to the Ryoka Or that you had broken out of jail And I couldn’t believe you would raise your sword against members of your own Squad But, I… I joined Squad 6 because you were my hero! No matter what happens, I want you to live! And I want you to be cool and fight for what you believe in! Rikichi… Why… Right now, he can’t use his eyes, ears or nose He cannot even sense Spiritual Pressure! Then how…is he able to counter me! Again! He dodges a fatal blow at the last second! Every time he parries, his counterattacks get more accurate too! Is he really a demon, after all I got a hit this time Just a graze but still… This Bankai that destroys senses is a nuisance But at least I still have my sense of touch And as long as I have that… I can feel the moment his blade makes contact, then dodge and counterattack At least that way, I won’t die My blade is starting to make little hits… but this is getting boring It’s more fun when you can cut and slash Now then… I can’t see and I can’t hear As for the Spiritual Pressure, I never felt much of it to begin with Dammit! Why do I have to waste time thinking like this! So stupid! Use your instincts! That’s what I’m doing right now! Maybe you should be using that mind-eye thing to try to visualize your enemy, you know If I could do that I wouldn’t be having this problem! What would I do Let’s see… I’d give up in a beautiful way Die Hold it… That’s it! An easy way to see his position He’s smiling again After all this, he still enjoys the fight You’re dangerous, Kenpachi Zaraki! You are too dangerous to be allowed to live! He didn’t dodge… Or…he couldn’t dodge Hey! So we meet again! Impossible! I can see now I can hear, too Is it because I’m holding you Or…is it because I’m touching your sword Either way it doesn’t matter Bring on the next attack I know your trick now Next time, I’ll be able to grab your arm before you penetrate my body Dammit… I must not lose I can never lose to the likes of you! I wish I could gather all the clouds so they would never again obscure the light that shines from the stars That’s beautiful… I’m going to become a Soul Reaper… If there is not enough justice… I will become justice itself And I will wipe out all the evil in this world like the wind casts away the clouds in the sky… with all the justice in my being! Tosen! Not yet! It’s not over yet! I quit I’m bored I have no interest in fighting a man with one foot already in the grave I’m out of here Dying is futile If you die, you can’t fight anymore I swear it! If it takes my very life I will stop you! What an idiot! If you wanna die so badly, die! Komamura! That’s enough This man will never understand you Don’t sacrifice yourself Komamura, I… I know What a shock… So that’s what’s under that basket You don’t look shocked Outward appearances have nothing to do with fighting abilities The only question is… if your beastly appearance means you fight with a beast’s strength That’s what matters You see only what’s on the surface You have no respect for an opponent’s inner strength That is your weakness I am not kind like Tosen Bankai… Kokujo Tengen Myo-oh Here I come, Kenpachi Zaraki! A fight to the death, just the kind you love! A fight to the death, huh Great! That means I can come at you with everything I’ve got! And then after you’re dead… go reincarnate yourself and come at me again! And now… Let us begin the execution So few people showed up Heh… The squads with both the captain and lieutenant in attendance are… the Head Captain’s Squad 1 and our Squad 2… plus Kyoraku’s Squad 8 It’s no surprise that Squads 5, 11 and 12 are missing… But what about the rest Even Unohana of Squad 4 is missing B-Brother… Rukia Kuchiki… Do you have any final words to say Yes… Just one All the days gone by have made me what I am Life’s not easy; that’s why I can go on To the people hurrying by, “Have your dreams come true” I’m still struggling… Forget returning to my youth; I want to live today well I was born timid Out where the sun shines I fisted my hand tight Break out of that place, that time, and I can change my life But I could never express everything deep in my heart Life’s not easy; that’s why I can go on How does the Sokyoku work I think it transforms into something What if it becomes a giant robot! Sokyoku Transformation! Come on bad guys, bring it on! Hey, thats pretty cool! You look like youre having fun, Ikkaku Squad 10 Lieutenant, Rangiku Matsumoto! Such divine cleavage! Squad 4 Captain, Retsu Unohana! Mom! Squad 5 Lieutenant, Momo Hinamori! Youre my kid sister from today Squad 8 Lieutenant, Nanao Ise! Scold me, please! Squad 2 Captain, Soi Fon! Is she a zashiki warashi ghost! The former leader of the Punishment Force, Yoruichi Shihoin! She can turn into a cat"

Ichimaru sent my heart into turmoil earlier, but now it’s slowly starting to regain some peace Is it because of the Head Captain’s promise Or could it be because while my mind was in chaos trying to think of a way to stay alive, my brother acted so serenely, not even turning to look my way Thank you, Brother Nanao… Don’t look so pained You’ll make me sad, too I’m not pained… Wh-What is that!

You, who threw away the title, have no place to escape Yoruichi!

Better run away so as not to take a second hit, Yoruichi The Suzumebachi’s killing power is in the second strike! If I hit you in the same place twice… Youll die! Here comes the second attack, Yoruichi! You’re showing your back to your enemy and running away, yet look at yourself! You may be running away to buy time, but its useless!

The winner gets to take a break in the meanwhile! If you hold back… Ill kill you! I see Youve mastered the Flash Step But… How leisurely As always You seem to be casually analyzing my powers But is that what you should be doing I thought you were going to kill me You havent even put a scratch on me yet Or are you telling me that this is all you’ve got Show me your Bankai You told me that you were going to cut me down and execute Rukia yourself What about it I dont like that! Im going to defeat you… with everything I have Im going to crush all of your powers until theres nothing left! You said youre going to execute your own sister No way! I dont care about your reasons or position! But I will never let you say such a thing in front of Rukia again! Release your Bankai Ill crush it myself!

Sorry to interrupt while you were getting all excited, but we dont want to see your unbearably grungy battle, so were moving on to the next one What did you say! What! Yuzus Super Heartfelt Diary Big Brother finally came home from his trip But there’s something strange about him He seems afraid of me And did he look like that Maybe he has something on his mind What’s that Bostov! Tune in again!"
" Ever since the powers of the Soul Reaper were thrust upon me, my whole world has changed I’m Substitute Soul Reaper, Ichigo Kurosaki I wield this sword with all of my soul and strength to protect my precious friends! You are my one and only No one can take your place Never fade, my only flower The sun never blinds you You are like a flower that blooms in shade Exhale those feelings you hold inside You are my one and only; now and forever The day may come when all will rise against us, but I will protect you Never give up, my only flower TIME NOTICE THAT YOU SHOULD NOTICE THAT NOTICE THAT THERE’S NO OTHER What was that light Is this the power of your zanpakuto Ichigo Kurosaki! Yeah… When I swing my sword, my zanpakuto absorbs my Spiritual Pressure Then it releases highly concentrated Spiritual Pressure from its blade In other words, it casts an amplified swing Thats Zangetsus ability At last, you are able to fire a shot at will Then I shall tell you, Ichigo There is a big difference in its power when you know its name than when you dont Remember this well, Ichigo The name of that attack is… Getsugatensho Ill say it once more Byakuya Kuchiki! Fight me with your Bankai! I am going to defeat you! Tensho, Piercer of Heaven, huh What a pretentious name… Very well… If you wish for it so strongly, then feast your eyes on… my Bankai He let go of his sword Dont worry I wont let you regret it You are going to turn to dust and disappear before you have the time to regret Bankai Senbonzakura Kageyoshi Not good enough I wont make it! The essence of the Senbonzakura… lies in its ability to create a relentless barrage from every direction by billions of blades attacking simultaneously Your zanpakuto’s abilities are indeed high However… Attacks that are too broad and clumsy… will never be good enough to fend off the nimble assault of Senbonzakura Damn! I thought I could do a little better I guess it was impossible Well, of course… Its foolish of me to think that I could beat a Bankai while only using my Shikai! Watch what you say You sound as if youve already reached Bankai Yeah Thats what Im saying… Byakuya Kuchiki! How is she Shes sleeping A Kyomon Why a barrier on this room I cant predict who is going to move how This is to protect her from any enemies Enemies… Lets go Could that be the Ryoka A clash of Spiritual Pressure like that at the Sokyoku… Who else could it be! Now that the situation has become this complicated, we have to try to control the matter by making a direct appeal to our superiors Do you mean to tell them about the incident with Captain Aizen Yeah… Especially about what really happened… Lets hurry! What did you say Dont make me repeat myself… You heard me… Or may be you just don’t want to believe it I’m not gonna repeat myself over and over You might not believe my words, but you’ll believe your eyes, won’t you Byakuya Kuchiki! Thats…Kurosaki No one fights crazy like that except him Really… Im glad I didnt pick a fight with him! Thats right! As the old saying goes, “Even a cat wont eat a childish fight” Inoue, it should be “Even a cat won’t eat a child’s fight” Ishida, thats also wrong Its not “childs fight” Its “a married couples fight” And it isn’t a cat that “wont eat the married couple’s fight,” it’s a dog Oh, was that it Sorry, sorry I’ve been infected with Inoue speak… And I was even corrected by Sado! Excuse me, but nows not the time to be playing comedy! I know! Lets hurry! Really… Is he smart or dumb Be one or the other so I know what to expect from him Ganju, youre going to be left behind! Huh! Oh, w-wait for me! A Bankai Impossible… Its the final stage of the zanpakuto Only Soul Reapers of the highest level are able to attain it Out of the Four Great Noble Clans, who are born with far greater Spiritual Pressure than others… Only one in several generations has the ability to reach that level And those who have reached that level… have all had their name’s etched into the history of the Soul Society That is the Bankai But what about him He became a Soul Reaper by absorbing Rukias power Hes not a noble He wasn’t even born a Soul Reaper So how can he talk about Bankai so casually How can he release such Spiritual Pressure This is as if hes… Yeah… Youre slow Even when you are falling Brother Byakuya! Ban…kai Ban…kai Tensa Zangetsu What is that That little thing is your Bankai Its just a regular zanpakuto… I see… First the execution and now the Bankai… It seems like you enjoy treading on the things we hold sacred Ill show you then! Ill show you what happens when you insult our honor “Our honor,” you say It seems like your so-called “honor” has something to do with killing Rukia Then I’ll tread on it just like you said This is why I got…this power! Captain… What…should I do… I have to find out… Theres no one guarding the front gate Thats odd… Theres no one here either… Its closed from the inside This is Captain Hitsugaya of Squad 10! It’s a matter of an utmost importance! Requesting permission to enter the Central 46! The emergency defense lock is working… Yeah Thats even more strange… Whats going on It seems like this is the entrance to the execution grounds… Whoa It’s so high! We have to climb this Kuchiki is up these steps… Ichigo… Lets go! W-Wait just one second! Doesn’t that Spiritual Pressure earlier bother you Who knows what’ll happen if we walk into the middle of a fight where they are fighting with such monstrous Spiritual Pressure! I’m telling you! Dont go! Thank you for worrying about us But no… We have to go! Yeah… Were his friends Yeah! Thank you for coming with us this far You don’t have to go any further Huh! Yeah! I guess this is where we say goodbye, then Umm…Mr Mini-mustache Yeah! See you later, Mini-mustache! Sorry for the trouble, Mini-mustache! H-Hey… Whats with these guys… Theres something wrong with them! Im not Mini-mustache! Ive been in the Squad 11 for ten years My name is Makizo Aramaki! Damn! And we members of Squad 11 dont know the meaning of the word “run away”! Oh yeah… And try to remember my name, you guys! For a moment… I lost sight of him I couldnt react… Impossible You… Why did you take the point of your sword away from my throat Are you just confident Arrogance destroys the footholds of victory Ill say this once more… That is not a Bankai A Bankai can never be so small and fragile And a lowly Ryoka could never reach Bankai You will regret not slitting my throat when you had the chance A miracle only happens once There is no second time, boy! What’s with his speed My Senbonzakura can’t keep up Whats the matter Cant keep up I can go a little faster, you know Dont get too cocky… Kid! He got faster Im twice as fast… if I control it with the palms of my hands! Theres nothing… I cant capture! Ive got him! Impossible! He knocked them all down A miracle only happens once, huh Then what do you call it the second time I see… By compressing all the fighting power of the Bankai in that small blade, that Bankai gives you maximum fighting power at unimaginable speeds… So thats the true power of your Bankai Very well… Then I shall completely crush that power! All the days gone by have made me what I am Life’s not easy; that’s why I can go on To the people hurrying by, “Have your dreams come true” I’m still struggling… Forget returning to my youth; I want to live today well I was born timid Out where the sun shines I fisted my hand tight Break out of that place, that time, and I can change my life But I could never express everything deep in my heart Life’s not easy; that’s why I can go on Did you see that, Byakuya! This is my-- Zenkai, full power! No, Ganju Its mankai, full bloom! Oh, sorry Umm… Was it genkai, limit Its Bankai! Oh whatever Youre already at your genkai All right! Genkai it is! Oh, is that so! Its all a manzai, comedy, now! Jintas Unbeatable Diary! Hello! Wha--! You again Because its cheap here 500 yen worth of snacks as usual, right Here! Ive always wondered, but isnt this a bit too much Its just your imagination! Now get out of here! Im busy training for a soccer match Wow, thats amazing Then… Ill let you borrow this as a lucky charm… Bostov! You dummy! A man doesnt need a stuffed animal! Tune in again!"

I wouldn’t know for sure Weve reached the top! Just beyond this, huh We cant see them… But I can sense him… Huh! No matter how big his Spiritual Pressure might have become, there’s no mistaking the scent of it It cant be anyone other than Kurosaki Thats strange… Huh! I dont sense Kuchikis Spiritual Pressure… I thought she was crucified up ahead… Shes already escaped Huh! Huh! Yachiru! Lieutenant! Hey there, Maki Maki! It seems my old nickname is back… What do you mean! If Ichigo was able to help Kuchiki escape, why is he still fighting! It means hes fighting someone powerful Just freeing her is not enough because you know the enemy’s going to come after her To really save her… He needs to defeat his enemy thoroughly and convince them out of the idea that Kuchiki should be executed Its the only way… Thats why Kurosaki is fighting… Hes probably putting everything on the line Th-There really is something wrong with all of you… What is Rukia Kuchiki to you! You’re willing to risk that much for just a friend! Of course! Shes our friend… Shes not just a friend Kuchiki is an important person to Kurosaki… Inoue… Because Kuchiki is the one… who changed Kurosakis whole world Take a look, Ichigo Kurosaki This is what happens… when I abandon all defense… and risk everything to kill my enemy This is the true form of the Senbonzakura Senkei… Senbonzakura Kageyoshi Dont worry This procession of a thousand swords will not attack you all at once This Senkei… is the form I show to only those… who Ive vowed to kill with my own hands You are only the second person to see it Im flattered… Here I come, Ichigo Kurosaki! Hey… Why you! What is this Spiritual Pressure! Inoue, I think we should move a little further away There isnt much we can do here Thank you, Ishida But I’m sorry… I want to stay here She knows… With her power, shed only be in Kurosakis way if she tried to help him… She also knows that even if there were something she could do to help, Kurosaki would never want that She understands all of that, so she is holding herself back… waiting… Shes praying for your safety… And believing in your victory… Dont lose, Kurosaki… If you lose… I will never forgive you Win, Kurosaki! Hes fast! Hes become faster since he revealed his Senkei to me But its still not a speed I cant match… I can go a little faster, too Whats wrong! Youve gotten quite a bit slower, Ichigo Kurosaki You think so! I still think youre moving so slow that your sword looks stationary… Hado Four Byakurai It seems like this is it for you, Ichigo Kurosaki What…did you say! My body… I cant move! It seems that you thought that Ive gotten faster after using my Senkei But thats not true Senkei compresses my numerous sword fragments into blades in order to explosively increase its killing capabilities I havent gotten faster Are you saying that its my speed that’s changed and that I’ve gotten slower! You fought well Youve defeated many captains and survived slashes from the Senbonzakura It is impressive that you have fought this far But you can feel it, cant you! Your flesh and bone are already dead… Youre only a human… There is a limit to what you can endure This is your limit This is the end, Ichigo Kurosaki! Move… Move… Move! Move… Move! Why have I come all this way Nothing will change…if I dont win! I want to win… I… want to win! I thought I told you It’s a big problem for me if you get yourself killed… Impossible… Who are you! Who am I! I have no name! Ichigo, you really suck! You were crushed by your own Bankais Spiritual Pressure All the bones in your body are creaking! You really are hopeless Ill show you… how to use the Bankai! A black Getsuga! This Spiritual Pressure… that mask… Are you a Hollow! Who cares! You don’t need to know, since youre going to… Disappear! Damn! Let go of me! Dont interfere Disappear! Youre the one who’s interfering! Dont you get it! You’ll win if you just leave it to me! Damn! Damn! You fool! Sorry for the interruption An interruption! I see… I guess defeating me in that form… is not what he wants… Very well… I wont ask you about what just happened I don’t think either of us has enough strength left to continue this fight for very much longer Well finish this… with the next attack… Yeah… Can I just ask you one more question! Why… dont you save Rukia! If you defeat me, then I will answer that question Shukei… Hakuteiken Thats amazing Sorry, but I dont have any amazing techniques like that Zangetsu only taught me the Getsugatensho The only thing I can do… is to put all of my Spiritual Pressure into one attack Here I come… Byakuya Kuchiki! I wont fall! You wanted to know… why I would kill Rukia Sinners must be brought to justice Once their punishment is decided, it must be carried out… That is the law So because its the law… youd even kill your own sister! Sympathy towards a relative! It’s worthless What…did you say! Compared to the law, feelings mean nothing… I dont have such worthless sentiments like that to begin with The Kuchiki family is one of the Four Great Noble Clans We have to serve as examples for all Soul Reapers Who would enforce our laws if we didnt uphold them! Sorry… I still cant understand… If I… If I were in your position… I would fight the law I see… I was never his true enemy Hes been fighting the law of the Soul Society from the beginning Ichigo Kurosaki… My sword was shattered by your reckless abandon… I wont chase Rukia anymore You win Oh no… I cant stand any longer Bonk! I’m sorry, Kurosaki! Are you all right! Sorry I have such a hard head! I was trying to catch you… Inoue! Ishida, Chad, Ganju! Thank goodness… everyones all right Were not all right But compared to how beat up you are, were like unharmed What about you, Inoue! Are you hurt! Huh! M-Me! Im fine! I wasnt of any use! But Ishida protected me! And Mr Zaraki carried me piggyback! So Im fine! I wasnt in any danger… It’s just… It’s just… I was so worried about you… Sorry… I couldnt protect you… Thank you…for surviving… Im…glad youre all right… Thank you… Inoue… What should we do! I got no choice Stand back You dont really plan to… This is the door to Central 46! Doing something like this… The alarm hasn’t gone off Huh! I broke down the door, but the alarm hasn’t gone off Someone must’ve defeated the guards and gotten inside, then locked the door and made sure that the alarm wouldnt go off if someone tried to enter after them… To keep things quiet… Wh-What is this! Whats going on! All the days gone by have made me what I am Life’s not easy; that’s why I can go on To the people hurrying by, “Have your dreams come true” I’m still struggling… Forget returning to my youth; I want to live today well I was born timid Out where the sun shines I fisted my hand tight Break out of that place, that time, and I can change my life But I could never express everything deep in my heart Life’s not easy; that’s why I can go on Captain, is it all right for us to just barge right into Central 46! Why not! Well, there are a lot of important people there, arent there! If I touch up my make-up and act sexy, I may be able to get someone rich to marry me! Matsumoto… Go home Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers Golden! It seems the guys from Mitsumiya have hired someone to help them So what! Weve got the strongest helper right here We are counting on you, Sensei! Yeah Just leave it to me! Sorry to keep you waiting! Youre late! Those are the kids from Uraharas Shop! They’re the helpers!

The blood is dry… Its blackened and even beginning to crack… Which means that they werent killed today or yesterday… When were they killed! After Abarai was defeated and martial law was declared, this central underground assembly hall was locked down and no one was allowed to enter And its defense system was engaged until we forced our way in just now There was no sign of a forced entry Which means that they were killed before then! And all the decisions given to us from Central 46 since then have been… all fake… Who did it Ichimaru Something this big by himself Or are there others who helped him I thought youd come, Captain Hitsugaya Kira--! Are you the one who did this! After him, Matsumoto! Yes! Wait! Kira! Answer my question! Are you the one who did that to Central 46! No I was just let in to the underground assembly hall before you arrived They opened the lock from the inside Who let you in! Why, Central 46, of course Are you making fun of me! What about the seal! Never mind all that, Captain Hitsugaya Instead of chasing me… shouldn’t you be concerned about protecting Hinamori What are you talking about Hinamori is… Shes not in Squad 10 barracks anymore Captain Hitsugaya, you put up a barrier around the room that Hinamori was sleeping in, didnt you You used Kyomon, a high-level barrier that reflects all attacks from the outside Thats why you left her there thinking she’d be safe But that barrier can be easily broken from the inside Hinamori is a master of Kido Its easy for her to break your barrier from the inside or move while completely hiding her Spiritual Pressure… You didn’t notice Hinamori was following you the entire time Matsumoto! Can I leave him to you Go ahead! What You’re not running away anymore You didnt know, did you, Matsumoto About what About my Zanpakutos ability… You don’t tell anyone about things like that Thats not true I think my classmates, Hinamori and Abarai, know… But thats okay Ill tell you, too… Raise your head, Wabisuke! You… You have good reflexes Who do you think you are! Theres something wrong with you! Kira! I dont know what Gin told you, but… How many times have you blocked my sword It doubles the weight of whatever it strikes If I strike twice, the weight doubles If I strike three times, the weight doubles again Until finally… the defender can no longer bear the weight and grovel on the ground, head bowed down as if in penitence Thus the name, Wabisuke, “the penitence one” If you weren’t counting, Ill tell you If a sword is 08 kilograms, that multiplied by two to the seventh power would make your sword 1024 kilograms Thats not something you can run with So what If I cant run with it, then I just dont carry it Gin…What do you want to do with him Roar, Haineko And what do you want with me… Just where do you want to go… What…is this Everyone in Central 46… is dead Everyone… Hitsugaya…was surprised… there was Kira… Hitsugaya followed him… Whats going on If Hitsugaya is the one who killed Captain Aizen, then he must be the one who did this as well, but… So…that means… the one who did this…is Kira Then… What about Hitsugaya… Is Captain Aizen… Welcome, Hinamori Captain…Ichimaru Come this way Hinamori! This is…Seijoto Kyorin, Immaculate Tower Grove The living quarters of Central 46… Why would you bring me here Captain Ichimaru… How many times have you been here, Hinamori No way… This area is completely off limits This is the first time Ive seen it There’s someone I want you to meet… Want me to meet Thats right But… Take a look Behind you Behind…me Captain…Aizen… Its been a while, Hinamori Is it really you, Captain Aizen I thought you were dead… Im alive, as you can see C-Captain Aizen… Captain Aizen… I… Captain Aizen… I’m sorry You must’ve been worried Oh… It’s Captain Aizens hand… Its so warm…and big… Talk as much as you like until you calm down I dont mind Stay as long as you like The same scent of Captain Aizen that cleanses my soul… It really is…Captain Aizen… I thought there was no hope… I thought I couldnt go on… but I was wrong… That was a lie A lie Yes, I knew… Captain Aizen wouldnt die I knew he wouldnt die and leave me behind… Youve become a bit thin… Im really sorry Im sorry for hurting you so much… But you understand, right It had to be you There was something I had to do I had to fake my own death and… Its all right… Its all right now I cant wish for anything more as long as youre alive… Thank you, Hinamori Im really glad I had you as a subordinate Thank you, Hinamori… Thank you very much… Goodbye What is…this What… Lets go, Gin Yes, Captain Aizen Hello, Hitsugaya Ai…zen! But how… Is it really you Of course As you can see, Im the real one But… Captain Hitsugaya returned a lot faster than expected Sorry Izuru must’ve failed to keep him What…What are you talking about What are we talking about Just strategy Dividing an enemy’s fighting power is the basics in strategy Enemy! Where is Hinamori! I wonder… Hina…mori How unfortunate You found her I’m sorry I didnt mean to surprise you Maybe I should’ve chopped her into little pieces so you couldnt find her Aizen… Ichimaru… When did you team up Since before you faked your death From the beginning, of course Since I became a captain I never considered anyone other than Gin as my lieutenant Then…all this time… Hinamori… Me… Your subordinates, all the other Soul Reapers… Everyone… Youve been deceiving us all! I never thought of it that way It’s just none of you understood… my true identity Didnt understand Hinamori… She looked up to you… She joined the Thirteen Court Guard Squads so she could be closer to you She worked so hard to become your lieutenant, to serve you… And she finally made it! I know That’s why she was so easy to manipulate Thats why I requested her to be my subordinate Wha-- This is a good opportunity Remember this, Hitsugaya Admiration is the state furthest from understanding Bankai Daiguren Hyorinmaru! Oh! Aizen… Im going to kill you Dont use such strong words It’ll make you look weak What! This cant be…happening… What a beautiful sight Ice is not in season, but its not so bad to see it at this time of the year Captain Aizen No, we probably shouldnt call you captain any longer… You’re just Sosuke Aizen, the traitor Hello, Captain Unohana I thought youd have shown up by now Did you immediately figure out that I would be here Seijoto Kyorin is the only place within the Seireitei that is absolutely off limits This is the only place to hide in the Seireitei for someone who’s gone so far as to fake his own death with such an elaborate corpse doll Close Your insight is good, but you made two mistakes First of all, I didnt come here to hide And second… This is not a corpse doll Wh-When did he… When Ive been holding it all this time But… I just wasnt letting you see it until now Wh-What do you… Youll understand soon enough I’ll release it now Shatter, Kyokasuigetsu This is my Zanpakuto, Kyokasuigetsu Its ability is perfect hypnosis Perfect…hypnosis But Kyokasuigetsu is supposed to be a running-water-type Zanpakuto… That it uses diffused reflection of running water and mist to confuse enemies into attacking each other! Captain Aizen, that’s what you told us! You gathered all the lieutenants and showed it to us! I see… So that was actually the hypnosis ritual Correct Perfect hypnosis controls all five senses and can cause every dimension of a target, including its form, shape, mass, feel, and smell, to replicate that of an enemy In other words, it can make a fly appear to be a dragon or a marsh a flowerbed And all I need to do to activate it is to show my enemies the release of Kyokasuigetsu Whoever lays eyes on it, even once, will be hypnotized into doing my bidding whenever I release my Kyokasuigetsu Whoever lays eyes on it… even once… It seems you figured it out Yes Whoever lays their eyes on it falls under my spell Which means that those who cant see will not be affected In other words… Kaname Tosen was my subordinate from the beginning C-Captain Tosen! Why are you here Wh-What is this! Before I go, Id like to commend you for sensing something suspicious about my dead body, Captain Unohana You had the chance to examine my body the longest, but you were still under perfect hypnosis Goodbye I doubt I will ever see any of you again Wait! What the hell was that all about… This is the Sokyoku hill Welcome… Abarai Captain Aizen It cant be… Ichimaru… What’s going on Leave Rukia Kuchiki here and back away All the days gone by have made me what I am Life’s not easy; that’s why I can go on To the people hurrying by, “Have your dreams come true” I’m still struggling… Forget returning to my youth; I want to live today well I was born timid Out where the sun shines I fisted my hand tight Break out of that place, that time, and I can change my life But I could never express everything deep in my heart Life’s not easy; that’s why I can go on In the next episode, I plan to divulge my true intentions with a dinner show Therere still some tickets available, but its first come first served Im making a special guest appearance Look forward to it Theres no such show! And youre no star! Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers Golden! Why is my sexy body being unreasonably strapped to that kid Damn it… Im going to get it back! Take this, Jinta Dribble!

I’m not interested You think all this is true Hmm… It could also be the enemys trap… No… It seems to be true Huh Kurosaki, dont you sense the Spiritual Pressure that just appeared up above! Rukia! What I said I refuse… Captain Aizen! I see That wont be necessary, Gin You are stubborn, Abarai If you dont want to leave Rukia Kuchiki and back away, then you leave me no choice But Ill take your feelings into consideration She can stay in your arms… but the rest of you goes R-Renji…! My my… Youve learned to dodge well, Abarai I’m happy to see that you’ve improved But I hope you won’t struggle for too long Its difficult to step on an ant without crushing it As your former superior, I’d prefer not to kill you if I can help it Renji! Shut up, Rukia! You don’t want to kill me Yeah right! Then why did you kill Hinamori! I’d trained her so that she couldn’t live without me So dont you think it was merciful of me to kill her Its also true that I didnt want to kill her myself So I went to all the trouble… and tried to have her, Kira and Hitsugaya kill each other But that didnt work out So I had no choice but to kill her myself I see… So you were the one pulling the strings on Kira and Hinamori! And you too, Abarai I get it Youre not the Captain Aizen I knew I dont know why you want her, but Im not handing over Rukia even if it costs me my life! Not the Sosuke Aizen you knew, huh Unfortunately, the Sosuke Aizen you used to know was just an illusion, Abarai He never existed in the first place Roar! Zabimaru! Shikai, huh I guess it cant be helped with the condition youre in, but that wont even buy you any time You never know! What a bothersome kid you are He stopped it with his bare hands! You really are the most troublesome of the three, Abarai Renji! I knew… I knew that I could use you three when I first met you So when you three joined the Thirteen Court Guard Squads, I had you all assigned to Squad 5 right away Then I made the two who were more useful, Gin and my subordinates I sent you away because you seemed troublesome It seems my instincts were right This is the last warning Leave Rukia Kuchiki here and back away P-Please wait, Captain Aizen! I will… I refuse Renji! Ren… I wont let you go… Like I’d ever let you go… You idiot I see Too bad Hey Whats wrong, crouching down like that It looks like Rukia is too heavy for you I came to give you a hand, Renji! Ichigo… Hey You came to help me… Thank-- Whats this All you had to do was carry Rukia and you’re all beat up! I guess just running away was still a too big of a task for you, huh! Huh What was that! You look pretty beat up yourself, too! What did you say! Is that something you say to someone who just came to save your butt! You idiot! I was trying to thank you earlier! Hmm Oh… Idiot! Do you think Im trying to make a new world record for holding my breath! Talking while pushing me against your chest like that! Sorry I didnt think I should interfere, so I let the boy pass No matter Its fine There’s no difference whether there’s one piece of dust to brush off, or two That’s Aizen Yeah Do you still have enough strength left to get away Yeah, but Im going to stay and fight You know damn well that running away won’t do, don’t you We may not be able to defeat them, but lets try to immobilize them and walk out of here Hah! I got no choice All right, then! Lets fight together! Right! I can only use this technique once… But if it hits, the enemy will be left open Strike in that opening Got it! This may hurt a bit but please hang in there, Zabimaru… Here we go, Zabimaru! Higazekko! Huh! Oh I thought I cut you in half from the waist down, but it seems it was too shallow That’s… impossible… He disappe… Da…mn… Ichigo… Renji…! I cant…move! Now stand… Rukia Kuchiki Hm Oh, I see My Spiritual Pressure has caused your body to go limp Ichigo! The poor thing He’s still conscious Having too much life force without abilities to back it up may work against you Give up already Youve all been useful enough You’ve served your purpose Purpose… Thats right I knew that you would enter through the West Rukon District That’s why I had Squads stationed around the area so that Gin could be there if something happened The walls of the Seireitei were lowered, and there were captains within the gates, so the only way to get in would be with Kukaku Shibas Flower-Crane Cannon A very flashy entry And those intruders were skilled enough to get past a captain As a result, the eyes of all the Soul Reapers within Seireitei focused on them Your actions after entering the court were quite impressive indeed And thanks to you, the news of a murdered captain did not create too much fuss It really made it easy to make my move H-Hold on How did you know that we would come in through the West Rukon District What a strange thing to ask Where else could it be The West Rukon District is Kisuke Uraharas base of operations West Rukon District is the only place you could’ve entered through with his Senkaimon Whats with that face You work for him, don’t you Didnt you come to retrieve Rukia Kuchiki under Kisuke Uraharas orders Wh-What do you… I see It seems you werent told anything Oh well This is the end anyway, so I’ll tell you Did you know that Soul Reapers have four basic fighting methods Zanjutsu, Hakuda, Hoho, and Kido Those are the four But there is a limit to how strong you can get in any one of them There’s a limit to how much a soul can take and that’s where the growth stops In other words, there’s the limit as a Soul Reaper Is there any way to get past that and surpass the limits of those four abilities to get stronger then Well, theres a way Thats… to become a Hollow A Soul Reaper to a Hollow, or a Hollow to a Soul Reaper… Only by removing the border between those two opposing existences, can one become an even greater existence In theory, it was thought to be plausible So I secretly tried to turn various Hollows into Soul Reapers A Hollow that could hide its Spiritual Pressure, or a Hollow that could destroy Zanpakuto with a touch and fuse with Soul Reapers But none of them worked out as well as I had hoped In the end, nobody could find a way But Kisuke Urahara made a way It was something that could instantly remove the border dividing Hollow and Soul Reaper, something that defied all logic within the Soul Society Its called Hogyoku Dangerous stuff He probably felt the same way He tried to destroy the Hogyoku But he was unable to find a way to destroy his own creation So he reluctantly resorted to another method That was to create a shield around the Hogyoku and hide it somewhere deep within a Konpaku, soul Now do you understand The place he chose to hide it was within you, Rukia Kuchiki What…did you say But when I found that out, you had already gone missing in the World of the Living I instinctively knew Kisuke Urahara had something to do with it He was once exiled from the Soul Society for creating an untraceable gigai that contained no Reishi There’s no other way a Soul Reaper in gigai can go missing There was another reason why he was exiled That gigai continues to break down the spirit energy of the Soul Reaper using it Because of that, the Soul Reaper never recovers his power The connection with the gigai becomes dim to the point that all of his spirit energies are lost His Konpaku is reduced to that of a mere human Do you understand now He didnt help you He was just trying to hide the location of the Hogyoku by turning you into a human Oh my You look like you’re in trouble Can I help you With a gigai may be But luckily, you were found in the World of the Living a few months later I immediately went to Central 46 and… Aizen! All the days gone by have made me what I am Life’s not easy; that’s why I can go on To the people hurrying by, “Have your dreams come true” I’m still struggling… Forget returning to my youth; I want to live today well I was born timid Out where the sun shines I fisted my hand tight Break out of that place, that time, and I can change my life But I could never express everything deep in my heart Life’s not easy; that’s why I can go on Did everyone understand what I was talking about I tried to make it simple enough for even stupid people to understand What did you say! We just met! How did you know that Im stupid, you jerk! You dont deny that youre stupid, huh Hey, youre making me blush Jintas Unbeatable Diary! Whats with this guy Why is he after me so much Hey… He’s obviously not after the ball… What is he… I get it! Its this! Bostov 		I don’t know why… but hes after this strap from the goddess All right then Ill take you on! Tune in again!"

S-Sorry… I didnt think anyone was here… This way Huh Thats odd… Sorry, I mean… I didn’t think you were there Im Kaname Tosen Pleased to meet you You really are good at hiding your presence I cant see, but I was never unable to sense someones presence… Komamura Youre Komamura, right Its been a while! I see Youve also joined the Thirteen Court Guard Squads Do you want to join my Squad I have a wonderful superior! Im sure you’ll like him, too You’re Komamura, right Ive heard about you from Tosen Pleased to meet you Im Squad 5 Lieutenant Sosuke Aizen Why did you become a Soul Reaper In order to repay the kindness to one man who saved me A debt of gratitude, huh That is your style What about you, Tosen Me Well… Tosen! Explain yourself if you can! Or can’t you How regrettable, Tosen! Bankai! Impossible… Aizen is still standing next to Tosen… Hado 90 Kurohitsugi They’re both captains… yet theres such a difference in strength Kyokasuigetsus perfect hypnosis is flawless There’s no way to escape it even if you know it’s coming Hado 90 without the chant How scary When did you learn how to do that No, it was a failure… I didn’t even get a third of its true destructive force Ninety really is hard to control Now then… Sorry, I hadn’t finished explaining, had I Kurosaki! Stay back! Kuchiki! Oh no no You shouldn’t be moving Inoue! Ishida! What incredible Spiritual Pressure! Rukia Kuchiki… When I found out you were in the World of the Living, the first thing I did… was to eliminate the Central 46 Wha-- Isane probably told you “Sosuke Aizen faked his death and hid his whereabouts” “Afterwards, he slaughtered Central 46” But thats not true As soon as I discovered you, I immediately killed Central 46 and used my Kyokasuigetsu on the entire central underground assembly hall So that it looked as if Central 46 was still alive and having meetings We always had one of us three in the underground assembly hall Since then, we had been acting as Central 46 and been issuing all of their orders To make sure of your arrest, I sent those two from Squad 6 to apprehend you In order to separate you from the humans… I ordered the immediate return and destruction of your gigai In order to completely evaporate your soul and take the Hogyoku from within you, I decided to have you executed with the Sokyoku The only time we werent in the underground assembly hall… were the few hours surrounding the two Captains Meetings I faked my death soon after that and hid underground Because I knew there was a possibility that the execution might fail because of you guys There are only two ways to remove a foreign object planted directly into a soul You can use an intense thermal disruption like the Sokyoku which will evaporate the soul that envelops it… Or by some other method that will interfere with the souls composition and forcefully separate them… In the unlikely event that the execution by Sokyoku failed, I had to find that other method For that, I needed the information kept within the underground assembly halls Daireisho Archive I looked up Kisuke Uraharas past research He was the one who developed the technique to plant a foreign object into a soul So I figured that… the technique needed to remove it must be hidden somewhere in his research Yes This is…that answer Wait--! Im surprised Its so small This is the Hogyoku… I see The soul is unharmed What a wonderful technique But, too bad I have no use for you anymore… Kill her, Gin Oh well Shoot im dead, Shinso!

What are you doing, Inoue Huh Oh… Oh! Nice work! Cut the crap! Don’t just leave your body lying around like that Hurry up and get back in it! I finally got out I have to go back in Now, don’t you ever come to my school again without a good reason! Why Got it! It’s still so hot…! Ow! Brain freeze! But it’s so refreshing… But it’s painful… You have to eat a little at a time Yeah Tatsuki, is your injury to your right hand all right now It was nothing Besides, the championships are coming up next month I’m in tip-top shape You’re really something, Tatsuki… Compared to you I’m… Orihime… Oh! Mm… Here it comes again! Did something happen At your relatives’ house… I-I wasn’t much use at all To tell you the truth… I thought I might be able to be of some help But, I might have just been in the way… Orihime… Oh, but that’s when I heard your voice saying… ”Hang in there!” That’s why I decided to do all I could That’s good enough You went because you wanted to, right It’s not for you to decide if you were of help or not You came right back here Welcome home, Orihime Uh-huh… I, Orihime Inoue…will do my best! Are you all right A hundred times fine! Kurosaki Clinic I’m home! Hi! You’re just in time for dinner You’re late Damn you… Is this payback for this morning Dinner in this house is at 7:00 Have you forgotten that Shut up! Come on, you two! Leave them alone That’s the only way they can show affection How about seconds There’s no reason to hesitate, just because you’re a freeloader Here, now, how about another serving, Mr Freeloader Uh… In that case… You’re the first to get seconds… Oh, please don’t hesitate, Mr Freeloader What is the matter Uh… In that case… Well, even a freeloader would like seconds! Eat up! Eat up! Quit calling him freeloader, freeloader! How can he ask for seconds Right, Mr Freeloader I can’t ask for seconds… Hey! Clean the front of the shop tomorrow morning, will ya What! It’s only natural for a freeloader to do that much You’re going to ask for seconds, right Come How about it, Mr Freeloader By all means… Thank you for the food Jinta, you’re too mean…! He’s more sensitive than he looks I must say… Pitiful… Forget that… Kisuke! What is it I haven’t been back in this town for a while, but I sense something unnatural… Do you have any idea what’s going on Hmm… There is some disturbance in Spiritual Pressure, but it’s nothing to get excited about Hmm… After spending time there, for the first time, I think that I might be able to discover the reason behind my strength I only went because I wanted to be of some use to Ichigo I wanted to do what I could for him But, I couldn’t… That’s why I don’t know what I should do We can only struggle Huh We received all of our powers through Ichigo So, if we’re going to stay with him… In order to do that, we have to enhance our powers! Chad… Didn’t this cause an uproar before Huh Hurry, Chad! Oh! I’m sorry! Hurry! Hurry! We’ve got to get out of here! Those who have gone themselves to Soul Society and learned the reason behind it… can no longer keep their eyes closed They can no longer keep their ears covered But I… Such an ominous moon… Ohh… What’s with that subdued reaction! You trying to make a fool of me! No…uh… What can I say You can’t get away with trying to be obsequious! This is what your sisters did to me! I’ll take you to Ishida tomorrow! Listen, you! I’ll bet you’ve gotten lazy! Damn you! Don’t act like a big shot… just because you got that Substitute Soul Reaper Combat Pass and can freely turn into a Soul Reaper! I’m not acting like a big shot! What’s the matter with you… complaining all the time How can I not complain Why didn’t you bring Rukia back--! S-Stop it…my cotton’s gonna I went… to stop Rukia’s execution I didn’t go to bring her back You don’t know anything about what went on there Quit yapping about it! Sure! I don’t know anything How could I! But you’re sadly mistaken if you think can do everything by yourself! What are you talking about Well, I’m doing the best I can too And yet…and yet… Rukia… I want to see her! I want to see her! I want to see her! I want to see her! Shut up and go to sleep! All right There! A bunny! Huh Brother! Orihime, you were waiting for me again Welcome home! I was making a bunny See! It looks just like one! Come Let’s go in You’ll catch cold Wait! This is big brother bunny I have to make an Orihime bunny! I see Then let’s make it together Okay! Brother…! Brother…! Brother… Oh… Why… Yes… I’m home… Brother… A Hollow… What in the-- Hm… A job so late at night… Strange… You seem to be well, Orihime I am… Brother… Did you… Yeah… I was able to go to Soul Society Don’t worry… I won’t become a Hollow again I’m so glad! You got there safely Yes You went too, didn’t you, Orihime To Soul Society… How did you know That much I know… What is it, Brother I was thinking you haven’t changed at all since you were little You were always worried about me Do you remember Making snow bunnies with your frostbitten hands while waiting for me Yes… Hey, Ichigo! Wake up! Hey! Hey! You’re finally up… You’ve let your guard down Shut up! What are you doing here at this hour What could it be, but a job Come with me Huh Why do I have to! Or is it that, just like Rukia, you can’t handle things by yourself What’s that! Will you shut up! It’s the middle of the night! Wh-What’s that! Huh After you had the nerve earlier, to ignore my feelings for Rukia and fall fast asleep… One, two, three sheep have jumped back into the corral, damn you! Hey, by any chance, is this… I don’t have any cavities… Oh, so it is a Soul Candy… You mean it’ll move even when you place it into something like this Why are you so interested in that Well…when I got here, I forgot all about it… So that’s why you had so much trouble getting out of your gigai So what’s this job you mentioned Oh… I got a strange message on my Soul Pager Well, it’s not much Spiritual Pressure, but can’t you feel it Oh! Inoue! Yeah… It’s near Orihime Inoue You should have told me that earlier! Let’s get going! O-Okay! Help…me… Oh, no… I wasn’t worried When I was little, I probably felt lonely inside an empty home I remember being relieved whenever you came home I feel the same When I was with you, I felt relieved Really Orihime… Yes Isn’t there something that’s troubling you For you to dream about me… What… What is this I sense Inoue… How did you know about my dream I told you I know, didn’t I How about stepping out for a breather There it is! What! What! What in the world…is that! Now, let’s go Brother… There’s nothing to worry about Come… Is that supposed to be the gates of Hell! Ichigo! Ishida! Chad! Inoue! It disappeared…! Inoue…! Count one! And move on Count two! And take a break Count three! And think through I’ll just go at my own pace Time goes by, and I get left behind But I say, “don’t forget that anxious feeling” They tell me, “A reckless challenge is meaningless” But I say “don’t give up” (Offense!) At times when the going gets tough, I raise my voice (Offense!) And head toward the direction of my goal There is nothing to be afraid of that towering wall Never losing sight in this life without answers Keep My Pace Count one! And move on Count two! And take a break Count three! And think through I’ll just go at my own pace I wonder where Inoue disappeared to Say, why don’t we follow her scent Yoruichi, can we ask you to do it Sure Leave it to me You mean cats can do that If you’re me, it’s a piece of cake! I knew you were capable of great things! Just kidding The Golden Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers after these messages! Golden! Perfect! Hey! What do you mean! Who told you to make me look so fancy! I just did a little rearranging! You went too far! Just look at me! You made my mane out of lace so I look more like a lace fairy than a lion!

Inoue! Damn… We searched all night and got nowhere Yeah… I don’t sense Inoue’s Spiritual Pressure anywhere If only we knew what that thing was… It sort of looked like the Gate of Hell The Gate of Hell Don’t you know what it is I do I saw it once before Well, there’s no way Hell would make off with a living human being Hey, Renji… Why are you here at school Stupid! I’m in charge of this town If something strange happens, it’s my duty to do something, right Renji, the point of your argument is slightly off You were asked what you were doing here at school Where am I off, huh! As I said, the question was… Stop it! This isn’t getting us anywhere! What bothers me most is what happened earlier… Hey, Tatsuki… Isn’t Inoue here Huh Inoue… Who’s that A new student What are you talking about Orihime…Inoue! What the heck are you talking about There’s no one here by that name Huh…! Their memory of Inoue has been erased It’s like when Rukia disappeared I get it! What is it Someone went to the trouble of using the “Memory Replacement” That means they’re taking our actions seriously Inoue hasn’t simply disappeared Someone’s behind this Okay! Then let’s go and check out her apartment again We might be able to find some clues That’s right Come on Let’s go Yeah… Hey! Just a minute! What about your classes This is no time to be worrying about that! It won’t open Then let me… You’re going to break down the door! We have no choice Let me handle this… Hey…isn’t that illegal There’s no other way, is there I suppose it might be better than breaking down the door But listen… Will you make sure no one sees me from the road Ishida, you’re really good at detailed jobs like this Quit making me sound worthless Hey! What’s it like in there Huh! Damn, there isn’t anything good… Hey, what are you eating I didn’t get much to eat last night I’m starving Hey! Look at this! There are two cups… What, and no cookies Do you have to keep talking about food I’m hungry! It hurts my stomach when you yell But you just ate! That wasn’t enough! Shut up! What in the world are you guys doing! This means… the being that possessed the Spiritual Pressure we sensed late last night was invited into this room by Inoue It really was a strange Spiritual Pressure I guess that means Inoue knew who it was Who could it be Who’s cell phone is that It’s my Soul Pager A Hollow No, it’s not It’s a call… Hello Hello Can you hear me Hey, you guys! You’re crowding me! I’ve got your friend She’s with me now A child Who are you Hm… What should I do Should I tell you Why’d you kidnap Inoue Why! Calm down, Kurosaki! Uh…yeah… You shouldn’t go into people’s houses without permission, you know Maybe I’ll call the police… Were we being watched There’s no one around Do you want to see your friend Sure I want to see her Bring her back, you! Why don’t we play a game Game Yes If you boys win, I might return your friend You…! You think you’re funny… Don’t let her get to you! Calm down So what do we do Come to the park at 2-chome within three minutes If you’re even one second late, there’s no telling what will happen to your friend So long! Within three minutes What do we do I don’t know what’s what, but we have no choice but to go there Damn! You’d better be safe, Inoue! Renji, don’t you have any idea who it is She called you on your Soul Pager I have no idea This was just supplied to me Anybody could find out the number We haven’t got much time Let’s hurry Okay! Huh! Looks like you got a little faster in the short time we didn’t see each other You just got slower What! Can you keep up Of course! I won’t lose to you! Kurosaki! Kurosaki! People will think you’re strange! Stop it! You look weird! We made it Hey, there’s no one here That’s strange… Hey! We got here in three minutes! Show yourself! Hello The first hurdle… You passed! Huh The first hurdle! Next… Just a minute! We got here in time! Give Inoue back! No, no! This is a game! It’s no fun if it ends so quickly Damn kid…! Get to the supermarket in  the 3-chome shopping arcade… within three minutes! W-Wait! That’s a crazy distance! Then, maybe your friend will die… Let’s hurry! We’ll make it! There it is! Hello Sorry Get outta the way, will you Hello The 2nd hurdle, you lose Wait! We made it in time! Someone else answered the phone, so you lose! Was that in the rules You didn’t tell us!

At least let me hear her voice! Tonight See ya! Hey! Don’t hang up! Hello Hello! How noisy! What in the world’s going on Yoruichi…! Now, now Don’t get so excited Hey! At least let me hear her voice! Tonight See ya! It sounds like a kidnapping, doesn’t it It is a kidnapping! I doubt anyone who would do this would just hand Inoue over It’s some sort of trap Judging from the fact that she called this shop, I’d say she’s not an ordinary person Then…a Soul Reaper Not necessarily There just isn’t enough information to be sure What do you think The same as Yoruichi There’s too little to go on Isn’t there any way you can check, Mr Urahara I guess I’ll have to try However, this is the first case like this for me, so don’t expect too much Okay Thanks 8:00 tonight… Are you going Of course! We can’t leave Inoue to them I guess not 8:00 PM Huh Are you going too, Jinta No Its just, if they’re going at 8:00, our freeloader won’t need dinner tonight What…! Renji… Pitiful… Yeah… Anything going on inside No Nothing yet Ishida, you didn’t bring your cape Well, uh, I sent it to the cleaners You send it to the cleaners That thing Why not It’s 8:00 What’s that! That’s Inoue’s apartment! Damn! It’s locked again! Okay, I’ll open it… There’s no time for that! Chad! Break it down! Okay Kurosaki… Inoue…! Did she really bring you back to us What’s going on Are you all right Huh What do you mean You were kidnapped last night What Me No way! You don’t remember anything Think hard, Inoue What’s the last thing that happened What… Let’s see, today… It’s a new semester, so I went back to school… met up with everyone… I ate shaved ice with Tatsuki and got a headache… Then I went home and after eating dinner, went right to bed, I think… The new semester started yesterday Huh They got to her and erased her memory Well, anyway, I’m glad you’re okay But we can’t breathe easily yet That’s right Let’s keep an eye out for a while Try going back to her apartment You may find her there Now, now… Don’t get so excited Hmm… Did you find something No I sent it through the voice analyzer, but… this voice has no Reimon, Spirit Crest No Reimon, Spirit Crest That would be equivalent to a voice print in a human Could it be broken Boss… Huh What is it Look there Hmm… I’ve never seen a cloud like that Is it Menos… No It differs somewhat What in the world… Nothing’s happening Shall I make some tea Wait… Something’s coming! Here it comes! Inoue! It’s not safe near the windows! The door won’t open! Inoue! I-Inoue… L-Let go of me! Inoue! What are you doing! What could it be You… You’re not Inoue! Who are you! Damn it! What’s the matter, Chad Never mind! Just shake her off! Chad! Damn you! Don’t use your zanpakuto They may just be using her body! Wh-What the…! Who are you! You’re not the one who called us! Or course, not! It would be weird if I had a voice like that, wouldn’t it My name is Kurodo And here’s someone else… Come on out, Noba! Glad to meet you Renji! I’ve got another one! Chad! It’s that kid! Where are you! I’m over here! Good evening! You’re the one who phoned us, aren’t you I am! My name is Lirin Nice to meet you! Why are you doing this It’s a game! A game!

Why are you doing this! Its a game, a game! Damn you! That wont do anything… Well, see ya later! Damn Whats going on! Uraharas Shop – Wait a second! Hey! – Hey! Whyd you do that all of a sudden! Urahara! Could I leave my body with you for a while That’s all right But what happened Chad was kidnapped too The enemy is attacking us one by one Its too dangerous to leave my body laying around unoccupied What am I going to do! Come with me Oh! So youre finally acknowledging my abilities, huh! You should have told me earlier if thats the case! Well, I understand the situation Ill take responsibility for your body Damn! What’s with those guys! It was incredibly hard to fight them--! It means that theres more to fighting than charging at your enemies Could it be that Aizen is involved Who knows… Urahara, did you find out anything I analyzed the telephone conversation… but there wasnt a Riemon, which is the spirit equivalent of a voiceprint What does that mean Who knows… At any rate, it probably means that theyre not humans or Soul Reapers… The Spiritual Pressure of those three are definitely a little strange You can tell Your ability to sense Spiritual Pressure is as poor as always… Shut up! If the enemies powers are derived from Kido, it will be difficult to directly attack them with zanpakuto So does that mean that I cant damage them with Zangetsus Getsugatensho In theory, yes, but… Kurosaki, can you control the power of that technique It has enough power to match Captain Kuchikis Senbonzakura Even if we do defeat the enemy, well suffer too much collateral damage What about you! If you use Bankai, you can do Kido-type attacks, cant you Im not confident that I can control my Zabimaru in Bankai Those in the ranks of lieutenant and higher, like me… are allowed only limited powers while in the World of the Living In that case… Ishida, youre the only one we can rely on Hit them with your Quincys power! Y-You dont have to tell me that! The enemy targeted Miss Inoue and Master Sado first because they were easier to take out Everything is going exactly as they planned… Thank you for your patronage This is Uraharas Shop Wheres Big Brother Its me Lets continue our game at the Karakura Museum! Come with everyone! Hey, wait! Hey! What happened to Chad and Inoue! Are they safe--! Hey! It seems theyre at the museum Again-- All right! This time, Im with you! Put your minds at ease and follow me! Hey… Whats the meaning of this! Shut up! I told you, we dont know where this enemy is going to come from, so keep watch behind us! But did you have to modify me into a backpack! Dont pull That hurts! I wouldnt mind if it was Inoues back, but why do I have to be on this guys back! Well, if I knew I was going to carry you, I wouldnt have modified you! It cant be helped… Renji and I have become Soul Reapers, so people cant see us--! I would have preferred Inoues back… Ishida… If something happens, you can throw him away and run! What was that! I cant do that I have important tools inside him Tools Ooh… Wh-Wha--… What the hell is this! I took out some of the stuffing in your stomach and modified you so I can stuff things in there Ah… Nicely done I think hed sell if you made lots of him Damn you… Ill sue you for infringement of stuffed animal rights! Just in case, should someone keep watch outside No, they have hostages Theres no point in doing that Special Exhibit for Ichigo Kurosaki and the Others Welcome Ive accepted your invitation! Come out! Hide and go seek You guys are it! What Whats the meaning of this! If you find us, well return your friends All right Well find you Also, leave your weapons here! What! You dont know whatll happen to your friends Threatening us, huh! Put them in that case! Zabi- “maru” (“circle”) They’re screwing with us! I think a circle is fine Shut up! Zan-“ketsu” (“butt”) Ill pummel them! You two, dont fall for their cheap shots! – Shut up! – Shut up! Its no good… Everythings going just the way she wants Whats this Whats wrong Dont you feel something Hmm Not really… But Ive been feeling strange Spiritual Pressure since weve been here I see… Kon, tell me if anything out of the ordinary happens behind us! Leave it to me! Whats with this place It seems like the same room goes on forever Was this building ever this big Were over here… Over here… Over here… Over here… Over here… Over here Which way The way to get out of a labyrinth is to advance with your hand against the same wall Lets go right There doesnt appear to be anything especially strange Thats odd We kept going right So this room should be the room next to the hall from where we entered But instead theres another entrance to the right Its the same room… Whats going on At any rate, lets head back Whats wrong The entrance is gone! What! Kon! I told you to keep watch! Shut up! I was watching, but there wasnt anything out of the ordinary! Thats no good At this rate, youll never clear this! Damn! At this rate, Ill break down this wall! Stop! Theres no point in doing that Judging by what they said, this is a game in which we have to solve a puzzle or something A puzzle Yes… There should be some sort of hint… Its as the boy with the glasses says! Theyre making fun of us! We shouldnt indulge them Theyre just stalling us by doing that They’re such a pain in the neck! Theyre using a fighting style that restrains our power and keeps it to a minimum… while making the best use of their power Were going to lose if we dont do this calmly All right Wait just a second! – Huh – Huh Ah… That tickles… Lets use this room as the basis of our investigation This role again, huh No, this is an important job that only you can do Were counting on you Oh well… If you put it that way, I guess I have no choice! Be thankful to me! What a simple guy… At any rate, lets go straight forward Whats that room Lets check it out Theres something here! Its…a display case Ichigo Kurosaki Wh-What! Renji Abarai Over here, too! Theres one for Ishida as well… Whats wrong! Inoue! Hey! Chad! Kurosaki! Abarai! Whats this! Hey, this doesnt look good! I cant raise…my arm… M-My body… This is bad… Da…mn…! Hey! Wake up! Ichigo--! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up--! That…hurts, you bastard! My stuffing…is coming out… My stuffing… Thats it! Ishida! Hey! Renji! Its dangerous here! Hurry! Lets go back to the previous room! This way! Follow me! Damn! I was surprised that you suddenly passed out and collapsed! Be thankful to me! Did that mist have hallucinogenic effects, or something Be careful Damn them! It seems safe here Renji! Stop! That was close… The floor suddenly disappeared… Too bad… Damn! This is really strange This kind of infinite loop is impossible even considering the size of this building Even so… Hey! Come over here! This is the pole we tied that line of yarn to earlier! Could it be Ishida, put Kon down Y-Yeah… Kon, dont let go! Huh What Its a möbius strip! Theyve twisted space to connect this labyrinth! So thats why we were going around the same place… Is it possible for them to do that! Thats the only thing I can assume Anyway, right now, we have to solve this game Drawing out the path weve taken… Its like this… There were traps in this and this room… If we go to the room ahead of us, therell definitely be a trap in it But if we move in an L shape, we wont come across any traps… Thats it! Thats the secret of this labyrinth! All right! Now we can get past this! Yeah! That would be great, but… Damn--! We must have missed… something How many things do you have stuffed in me Whats going on I havent heard those guys voices for a while… Shut up Use your head a little! Its amazing you worked as a lieutenant of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads! What did you say! Stop, both of you! Besides, youre in charge of this town If you did your job, none of this would have happened! Be thankful that a lieutenant took his time to come! Theyre fighting! Hey! Cut it out and show yourselves! Understand that its pointless unless we solve this puzzle You dont know how to do it either! What did you say! Stop! Everyones just tired and annoyed! Calm down! Shut up! Ichigo, Im going to do this by myself! Yeah, you do that! I dont want to work with you anymore! Oh come on… A split among friends--! – I wasnt this guys friend to begin with! – I wasnt this guys friend to begin with! Really…! Whats this The space…is twisting Whats wrong By this order, theres a trap in that room, isnt there Advancing in an L-shaped route… space loops… and traps that block us… When that gate mysteriously appeared… When Inoue and Chad disappeared… And ever since weve entered this building, this Spiritual Pressure I feel is… I see! Kurosaki! Abarai! I know the secret! What did you say! Really! Listen closely… Could it really be so simple Is that really all right Yeah Leave it to me Also, Kurosaki, lend me your Substitute Combat Pass What are you going to use it for Its just in case… Here I go! Ishida! I knew it! Correct! This is… How did you figure out the secret We had the hint for a while I figured it out once I drew it This is a childs game There are nine rooms placed in a 3 x 3 format You just made them loop infinitely If we were to go three spaces forward or horizontally, we would win So whenever we were close to getting to three spaces, youd create trouble for us Your traps were all illusions There was no way you could set up real traps to match our movements With illusions, you could lead us any way you liked We discovered the way that the traps were set and avoided them But that was a psychological trick Our friends were kidnapped and we became extra cautious So we moved as a group You never expected that wed suddenly go in separate directions and… by chance, take up three spaces You probably started to worry when Kurosaki and Abarai went more than nine spaces apart from each other Thats when the twist in space appeared Well, finding that was a coincidence At any rate, we just had to pass through the rooms with traps… and connect three spaces Correct… But… Ishida! Even if you solve the puzzle, the game wont end until you catch us! Its finished! I thought so, you really are mod-souls Oh… How did you know I noticed that the small traces of your Spiritual Pressure that I felt when I entered the Museum, matched that of Kurosakis stuffed animal I was carrying this embarrassing backpack… So I got to learn about the characteristics of a mod-souls Spiritual Pressure Dont call me embarrassing! Renji, did you notice No… The one who appeared from nowhere used his power to control space Are you the one who showed us those illusionary traps Tell us what you plan to do! Wait! Inoue! Chad! Kurosaki! Why I dont know We were just suddenly thrown out here… What!

" Ever since the powers of the Soul Reaper were thrust upon me, my whole world has changed I’m Substitute Soul Reaper, Ichigo Kurosaki I wield this sword with all of my soul and strength to protect my precious friends!

Thats you, Kurosaki… Why is my gigai here! Could Urahara have left it here At any rate, itll be bad to leave those there! Youll have to return to them before everyone comes… Y-Yeah! Heh! What a pain… Its hard to return! Damn it! Damn! Its so uncomfortable! But, from here on… All right, Ill explain the next games rules! Youve come out again! Thats a mean way to talk! I came all this way to tell you that theres a fake among you… A fake! What do you mean! Look at them… Theres only two of them! That copying guy isnt there! Could it be that he traded places with one of us! But…when Could it be… I know! I know! Dont you think that Inoue and Chad are suspicious The enemy could have switched places when they were captured No way! Well…I can tell if Inoue… Is real or not… If you just invite me to your godly bosom Shut up! Its a trick! Its got to be! Believe what you like, but if you dont find the impostor quickly, your friends at school will all disappear! Hey, brat! We dont have time to constantly play your… Thats no good The game has already begun Shes fast… Shes…definitely not normal Now, Ill explain the rules! Find out who the switched person is before the clock strikes twelve If you figure it out, you win! But if you guess wrong, were going to make everyone in the whole school disappear! Disappear--! Yes… Oh, do you know what I mean by “disappear” It means that theyll vanish and youll never meet them again… Oh, you can only answer once! Let me know when youve decided! Hey! Can they really make everyone in school disappear Well They did make Inoue and Sado vanish… Thats true, but… But this is a much larger number of people! Inoue, Sado… Do you remember what happened after you were sucked into that gate Well… I dont really remember… We were floating in darkness… Thats all Hey, Ishida, cant you figure it out I cant! If I were to guess… The gate is probably connected to some alternate dimensional space An alternate dimensional space Its a world beyond our comprehension The number of people may not make any difference But what Im worried about is… unlike the time with Inoue and Sado, this time, they said theyd make everyone disappear Disappear Could it be that… Yeah We can assume that theyll be killed… Thats not funny! I wont let them do that! Who is it! Hey, Ichigo! Why the scary face! Good morning! Ooh! Hey! Whats with that get-up! You look as if you were out all night Did you leave me out! I see! So thats it! – Look… a lot’s happened! – No! Orihime! Oh, Tatsuki! Wheres your uniform – This persons still here – Oh… Well, a lot happened… Ah…well… Hes a relative, isnt he Oh yeah! Right! Hey, what are you… How long are you staying here F-For a while… Dont you have school No…not really… Then, where do you live What kinds of girls do you like-- – Shut up! – Shut up! As I expected of relatives! Youre really alike… Oh no… What was that for What did I do! Out of the way! Im going to be late--! Hey…Keigo! Orihime, lets go too! Y-Yeah… What are you going to do, Kurosaki Its obvious… We have to find the impostor among us in order to save everyone Sado We should go to class… Itll be difficult to move if people are suspicious of us I suppose thats right… Nothing will be solved if we stay here Also… Kurosaki, you should also contact Uraharas Shop Huh Im concerned about why your body was left on the school grounds Yeah… Definitely… Well then, do you understand what this question is getting at This question points to the fact that two contradicting factors, logical idea and illogical idea… If there was a chance to take any of our places… Damn… How am I supposed to tell whos the impostor! Is it Ishida Inoue Or is it Chad Hey! That copy guy is pretty good at transforming Wh-Why are you sitting here Why Because Im bored Get out before someone finds you! Dont be so uptight So this is what your textbooks look like… Just go away! Dont come so close that youre breathing on me! Its gross! What! I was behaving myself, but you started getting cheeky! Bring it on! Come on! Kurosaki Brothers, if you want to fight, do it over there! Why do I… Damn! Youre being punished! You too! Is he acting a bit…strange Was he ever this messed up Could it be-- Is he the impostor Renji…take it off! Huh Just take it off right now! What are you talking about Just take it off! If you wont, Ill take it off for you! W-Wait just a second! No, I cant wait! S-Stop it! Ill rip it off you! W-Wait! No, I cant wait! Thats… I told you to take it off! Stop! Forbidden love… How wonderful! Dont you think that Ichigos… acting different Thats not it! His gigai, his gigai! I thought I would be able to tell if it was actually him if he could take off his gigai! It would probably be difficult to change into a Soul Reaper! We still dont know how powerful his copying ability is Its still too soon to make such assumptions I dont think that was a very smart method We should keep in mind that he might not only copy appearances, but abilities as well Theyre doing it, theyre doing it… Now then… Maybe Ill push them a little more Aw man! Theyve got to make more girls bathrooms! I thought I was the last one… Who is it! Is someone…there Starting now, for the next few hours, well temporarily stop all passage to the World of the Living! Sentaro, give the order to close the gate! Yes! Understood! Close the gate! Close the gate! Close the gate! Close the gate! Close the gate! Thats right… I asked Ukitaki to close the Senkaimon Soi Fon… Sorry, but could you come here before they close the gate Its urgent! Yes! Of course, Lady Yoruichi So…Today for PE, the boys will have baseball… and the girls will be running – What Running! – That sucks! Be quiet! Uh, whos absent Umm, Arizawa isnt here… Thats odd… Does anyone know where she is Well, thats okay… Shell come sooner or later Ive already got one! If you dont find the impersonator, theyll continue to disappear! What What do you mean Say, could it be that you… No way! Hey, whats wrong Inoue! Inoue! Wait! Hm Whats wrong with you all! Were all feeling sick, so were going to the infirmary! Hey, wait! Hey! – Whats going on – I find that hard to believe! I dont know either Tatsuki! This is Tatsukis… Inoue… Tatsuki was… Tatsuki was… Calm down… Were still not sure she was taken away No! Inoue I cant stay calm! Arent you worried about Tatsuki! Could it be that…it was you! I cant take it anymore! Why did this happen! I cant trust anyone! Whos the impostor! Tatsuki… Give Tatsuki back! Stop it, Inoue! Being suspicious of each other is what the enemy wants! Tatsuki is all right! Leave it to me! Kurosaki… I wont let her disappear! Thats so cool… But can you do it It wont do you any good if you cant find the impostor Your other friends will continue to disappear if you hesitate! Times not up yet! Thats right But now you know that were serious! You have an hour until times up See you later Hey! Theyre good at running away Damn…! Really, what a pain… Ill answer it! I just have to answer, right! Yes Uraharas Store… Oh, its spiky-hair guy Huh! Yoruichi! Come to think of it, she hasnt been here… since this morning… What I dont know where she is The owner is always… What a pain… All right, Ill tell them! See you later! Its no good! Yoruichi and Urahara have gone off somewhere Renji, how was it I dont know why, but I cant contact the Soul Society… I cant get any information… No way… What should we do We dont have any options left Damn… Lets all stay calm Maybe, weve sensed some small inconsistencies about the impostor… on an unconscious level What do you mean Put simply, intuition Intuition If all our intuition matches, then that person is the impostor! It all comes down to intuition, huh Based on my intuition… the impostor is… The impostor is… You, Ishida! M-Me! Thats impossible! W-Watch this! Can the impostor do this technique! If anyone is the impostor it would be… Him! Hes the most distant to us and… theres the least possibility hed be discovered! Thats stupid! In this case, the least suspicious one is most suspicious… Thats the way it always is! N-No… If thats the case… Then Ill pass the suspicion to Chad! I-Im not him! This is all your fault to begin with! Why are you trying to confuse us! You impostor! Damn it! Whos the impostor! I cant stand this anymore! It seems it wasnt any good… Time’s almost up! Take a look outside! Its a fly ball to the pitcher! I got it! Whats going on! Im tired Im going to just stop already! Th-Thats not good! They disappeared! How could you! What are you doing! Hey! What are you all making a fuss about! Miss Ochi! Wh-Why you…! A lot more have disappeared than I thought! Damn you! This isnt tag! Give your answer soon Youll never know if you keep thinking forever! O-Oh no! Theyre not what youre after! Dont involve people who have nothing to do with this! I cant change the games rules Well, you have a one in five chance to get it correct Youve got no choice but to leave it to luck! Or are you going to surrender If you do that, Ill think of a way to save everyone Is that true! What do we have to do Its easy! You all must give your lives in exchange for everyone elses! What! Well, of course! Cant you do it People who have nothing to do with this are disappearing because of you This is a serious battle! What was that for! Yoruichi! Hey! Yoruichi! Yoruichi! Didnt they come to save us! Why are they in a rush That scared me… Chad… Y-Yeah Do you have an idea of what theyre doing Who knows But she sure is tough for a lone woman Huh Say, I cant wait forever, so make a choice already! Yeah, sorry… Ive decided! Huh! Chad… Its obvious why you dont know You dont know that Yoruichi has the form of a cat while she’s over here, do you Thats because youve never set foot in the Soul Society! Youre the impostor! Youve figured it out… Very good But when did you notice I thought my transformation was perfect Chad would never be scared of something like that! You amateur! I see… It seems I still need improvement I wont forgive you! Im going to make you take responsibility for what youve done! Im going to beat you to a pulp! Thats a little… Shut up! Im sorry… I let my guard down a bit Well now, its two wins and two losses Give Tatsuki and everyone else back! Everyones safe! Lets play the last game Youre still making us do this again! Cut it out! Is it all right to say that Because if the big boy was the impostor, then wheres the real one Thats right We still have him Count one! And move on Count two! And take a break Count three! And think through I’ll just go at my own pace Time goes by, and I get left behind But I say, “don’t forget that anxious feeling” They tell me, “A reckless challenge is meaningless” But I say “don’t give up” (Offense!)

What confuses me the most is why… they have to come and set up these tedious games Theres a lot we dont know! Captain Soi Fon did Yes… It seems she went off somewhere alone right before the passage was cut off Without taking the punishment force Is that true Yes… Omaeda said so… Whats going on It’s something that Yoruichi Shihoin and Ukitaki planned and are putting into effect! Leave it alone! That aside, how did you get that information from Omaeda Werent you here all day finishing your paperwork Oh yes… I went out…for a moment… and ran into him… I see For a moment, huh Then…whats that mountain of documents doing hiding behind the sofa Matsumoto!

You came, genius boy! Want some Ill pass! Im going to interfere Captain Hitsugaya What are you two old guys doing together A bit of investigation Right now, Soi Fon is sending data from the World of the Living Was that why you closed the Senkaimon Yeah… Its easier to collect data on foreign elements if we temporarily block the passage of souls Foreign elements! Yeah… Im trying to figure out what it is Could it be… related to the Aizen incident! I dont know… Everythings just beginning Its here! Shes obtained a Reishi sample! Ill put it in the analyzing machine! What is this! Theres no corresponding data! Rin! Analyze it once more! Yes What do you think – Yeah… Its odd – New data, uploading Correction value… At any rate, it seems we should… – look into this a little more – There really is no data! Try it once more! Wha--! Looking at it close up, its incredibly huge! Over there! What do you think Isnt this amazing! Just cut it out and tell us your plan already! Why are you doing this!

Thank goodness… Youre all okay All right… Where in the world are we Is this the alternate dimensional space you were talking about Who knows… Its amazing you didnt die I wont forgive you!

This is… Dont stop a man and a woman from having a good time together You were trying to suck out his soul Who are you! Youll find out in time! Shall I chase her No… She seems like shes good at running away You sent the data, didnt you Yes! Who was she Yeah… Its the first time Ive seen her Soi Fon, go back and report the details to Ukitake and the others! Yes! Sentaro, are you there Yes! The investigation is finished! Take down the passage barrier immediately! Yes! I understand! Well, were finished for tonight Good night Captain Hitsugaya… Can you help me tomorrow I dont mind… What do you want me to do Yeah… Its useless! Then what about this! Ichigo! Are you all right! Damn! Arent you finished Times almost up! Chad! Its absolutely hilarious that youre trying to defeat us with such slow attacks! Now for the final attack! Wh-What! – Kurosaki! – Again! Do your Bankai! Its our only choice! All right! Ban…! Whats wrong! – What! – Huh! Oh! A light! Ow! Chad! Chad, are you all right! Yeah Ill untie you! No… It seems it loosened… Huh Sado! Thank goodness youre safe! Yeah Chad… Did something happen while you were captured There was tea See! I told you! There really was, wasnt there! Yes! H-Hey! Kurosaki I see, so thats it Come out! I know youre here, Urahara! – What! – What This is all your doing! Well, it seems youve figured it out… When did you notice When I saw your hat on the ground just now See, Lirin I told you, you were over acting! Youre sharper than I thought! Come to think of it, you had many chances to finish us off But you never did You just pushed us into tight situations Thats what was strange Chad wasnt even harmed, was he Yes! We even played Shogi with each other! I never won once… So why did you do this Before that, can you return my hat Games can cultivate various senses Stamina, of course, intellect, team work, the ability to cope in an instant, judgment… It even strengthens your bonds to your friends And most of all, it is a good chance to take a look at yourself Look at myself Yes Your Bankai… you cant use it, can you Wh-What! Is that true! Ichigo… You are a Soul Reaper substitute Not a Soul Reaper You may have been able to use it quite a bit in the Soul Society, but… Things arent quite so easy once youve come back here You especially shouldnt be naïve enough to think that if things get tough, you have your Bankai Its no wonder you cant use it That aside… Did you know that Yoruichi and the others are investigating something She was rushing around at noon… I dont know the details, but there seems to be a bad phenomenon happening A bad phenomenon Yes… The Soul Society temporarily closed off passage to the World of the Living to begin investigating the specifics Could it be… that it has something to do with the Aizen incident! No He only took away the Hogyoku He still needs a little more than a year to mature it in order to demonstrate its true power He probably wont make a move right away But in your current state… youre too weak Kurosaki… What I cant leave the troublesome issue of the Hogyoku alone Please learn how to use your Bankai once more Please help me Yeah All ri-- Really! Oh, thank goodness! Hey… What a heartless prostration… So, Kurosaki, lets cultivate your situation analysis and judgment skills Huh Oh… You allow your opponents to take advantage of you too often Do you use your head In the end, Ishida, whos lost all his powers, is better at doing that… Arent you, Ishida… I lost my Quincy powers in the Soul Society… Why didnt you tell us! You didnt use them because you couldnt use them Is that true, Ishida You sure are an idiot… What did you say! Youre just endangering us Huh-- Im not saying that its dangerous because you have no powers… Fighting as a team means that we all can use various powers Your powers helped out this time You dont know if youll be of any help unless you try! But if you dont trust your friends, you cant fight… Isnt that right Kurosaki… All right! Then lets go up and have something to eat! Tessai should have made something delicious! Hey, what are you going to do about the destroyed town Theres no way wed do that! That was a hallucination as well! Then wheres everyone from class Right about now, theyre… Hm-- Oh… Where am I Whats going on! Where are we Ah… Youre all finally awake! Miss Ochi! Why are we in the mountains!

Youll find out in time! The Bount I saw was trying to absorb the soul of a living person… What happens to people if their souls are sucked out The same thing as when their lives are taken The result is, in other words… death Death… Were still not sure if its a Bount Do you suppose that it could be a subspecies of Bount Well, who knows… Why are you crossing your arms and thinking so hard! At this rate, there may be more victims! All right! Just as I expected of you, Kurosaki! You sure have a strong sense of justice! Cut the sarcasm… So anyway… – Lirin – Huh Go to Kurosakis place What No way! Huh What are you talking about Kurosaki, Inoue, and Sado will act as support Support These three mod souls have reishi sensor functions attached Sensors They can detect reishi waves In other words, the enemy is targeting living humans All of you have exceptionally high abilities for humans You would be tempting prey for them Were not sure if theyll notice you We have to find the location of the enemy quickly Hmm… I see… What Huh Then what about me Oh… Its as I just said… You dont have any abilities! Thats right…isnt it Now then… So Kurodo will go to Inoues place Well, I guess it cant be helped… Youre leering Youre leering… It cant be helped… Noba, go to Sados place Whats the point in closing your mask Well, I guess it cant be helped But…dont give me too much trouble!

Captain Kyoraku! There is a message from Captain Ukitake saying that he wants you to hurry to the Central Library Captain! Youre awake, arent you! Why do you speak in such an unrefined voice… Its a waste of your beauty Were you listening to what I was saying I was listening… Its probably some crude work, isnt it It seems that the material concerning the item were investigating has been lost Hey! Why are you both so quiet! Someone might think its some sort of broadcasting accident! Dont look at me like youve seen something unusual! The three of us are here, so shall we form a trio Huh Did something happen Will you listen Kurosaki Clinic No way! No, no, no! Even if you say so… The only stuffed animals remaining in this house are the really old ones that Yuzu and Karin had when they were really young… – No! – Oww! What are you doing, you…! At any rate, I cant believe that youre trying to force me into these ratty and ugly things! Im going to tell Kisuke if you dont take this seriously! All right… Then what kind of stuffed animal would you like Tell me If I know what it is, Ill look for one… Well… Definitely…something thats smart and moves quickly… Something that reveals a glimpse of cuteness within its beauty… A bit gothic, but… – not too formal… – This is a pain! – yet not too cheap… – This is good enough! Huh What is this--! What is it Probably a bird… Hold on! What are you doing! I cant change bodies once Ive gone into one! – Is that so How nice – Ill be like this all my life!

Watch how you talk… Im in a really bad mood right now! Y-Yes… Since then, shes gotten carried away and bosses me around… Isnt it horrible-- Im still sort of her elder! Here you go… Oh! Seniority is important, isnt it! Im an elder of mod souls! Theres a proper order for things! But I wanted to go to Inoues place if anything… I want to be held in that large chest… But that damned old man! Im so jealous! Having such a stuffy old man pushed on to her probably upset Inoue! Say, say, dont you think we should see what the situation is at Inoues house No… not particu-- Right! Inoue is definitely troubled! Were not men if we dont go! What was that voice! Could it be… Could it be that Inoue is in… This kind of… or that kind of… situation, is she! What is it! Peeping isnt good Im not peeping! Im just keeping watch to protect Inoue! Oh dear! Oh, I cant leave this alone! Here I go! Huh Its as I thought! Youre really cute!

" Ever since the powers of the Soul Reaper were thrust upon me, my whole world has changed I’m Substitute Soul Reaper, Ichigo Kurosaki I wield this sword with all of my soul and strength to protect my precious friends! You are my one and only No one can take your place Never fade, my only flower The sun never blinds you You are like a flower that blooms in shade Exhale those feelings you hold inside You are my one and only; now and forever The day may come when all will rise against us, but I will protect you Never give up, my only flower TIME NOTICE THAT YOU SHOULD NOTICE THAT NOTICE THAT THERE’S NO OTHER It turned out that the three mod souls were created by Mr Urahara in an effort to get us to reflect on our own strengths Meanwhile, a mysterious group called “Bounts,” who suck out the Souls of living people, appeared Lirin, Kurodo and Noba hid themselves inside stuffed toys in order to give us their support With their investigative skills, they discovered the Bounts Damn it… Where should I cut Goethe, finish him! Huh! What are you doing, fool! Have you gotten rusty, Ichigo Rukia! More, Goethe! Destroy them! Destroy them All right What kind of power is this! No…  It’s too big! Ryo! Ms Yoshino… Roaming around without permission Are you a Bount, too! What was that all about A noisy one, aren’t you Ichigo! Be careful! You know, food doesn’t talk Huh… What do you mean! Now, let’s go home I guess I have no choice… Friede! You will not disobey… You’d better not fight it My doll, Friede, is a bit short-tempered, you see H-Hey! Weren’t you two on the same side I said you’re too noisy… I’m getting a headache! Soul Reaper, noisy! What’s going on What are the Bount’s capabilities If you will excuse us now After all, nobility and pigs never share the same table Friede! Wait! What was that I have no clue – Huh – Oh! Orihime! And Chad…! Ichigo, that guy… You know him Just a while ago… he made someone… Rukia…! Oh… The never-before explored great 180-degree great cliff, that I have but dreamed of, is right before my eyes… This is my first climb… What do you mean, “great cliff”! Rukia! Welcome back! Um… Yeah… I didn’t think I’d be able to see you so soon… Yeah… Hey! That dress looks really good on you! Ishida’s love…oops… No, no… Let’s see… Oh, yes! “Umeya” near the school has started serving green tea spaghetti! Let’s all go there to celebrate your return! What do you say, Rukia Uh…sure! I’d be delighted to join you Yes, that’s the spirit! And then…their deluxe curry frappe is pretty good, too If you pour it over shaved ice, it’s out of this world I suddenly received orders to rid this town of Hollows again I really preferred to spend more time in training, but I couldn’t disobey my orders Oh, man… So I’m stuck with you yet again That’s my line Ichigo, who the hell is this! Wh-What’s with that ugly stuffed toy! It’s not my fault! I don’t look like this because I wanted to! I have to provide support for Ichigo, so I had no choice! Support… Yeah Mr Urahara gave her to me, saying we had to watch out for those guys we just ran into I don’t understand If you judge things by their appearance, you’ll be sorry! Lirin… I think Miss Rukia is speaking of the Bounts Huh Hm… Are they allies, or enemies Really, those guys are difficult to read I don’t even know their objective I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know… Hello…young lady… What…is this Huh This is Kurodo He’s supporting me And this is Noba, who’s with Chad Hello… Oh What What…! Yes He’s so cute! He looks exactly like Chappy! J-Just a minute, Rukia! Wasn’t I the one you loved best! I like you and all, Rukia, but I can’t give you Kurodo… Oh! Are we rivals in love In short, “lovals” Hey! What about me! Here I was thinking I was accepted as the fluffy, healing character… Have I fallen by the wayside Been given the hook Been waylaid Made the bad guy Nooo…way! Come in… Beautiful, isn’t it But, this view can only be seen because we are surrounded by darkness Jin… We could never become brilliant lights Did you eat a proper meal How could you have any strength, if not And this bruise… Did you cause Udagawa trouble again Did something happen that upset you Perhaps Yoshino doesn’t understand her position here I find it difficult watching her actions My position What do you mean I think you ought to think that over Never mind, Udagawa Don’t be so cruel to Yoshino Yes, sir Forgive me Even so, Yoshino I cannot forgive you completely There’s nothing for which I need your forgiveness Oh I won’t be ordered around by anyone! That’s fine… But I worry about you You are much too weak and foolish So much so, that I have no choice but to protect you Don’t do it I don’t want to hurt you any further Kurosaki Clinic Excuse us for visiting at such an hour We have decided to spend the night studying for tomorrow’s test, as young people tend to do… Welcome Please make yourself at home Thank you! Don’t you dare try to come in! I won’t let you in even if you try to bring us juice or cake, or anything! Take that! Ouch…! – There’s no pain! – Ichigo, are you all right This is a dream, after all! Dad, whats the big--! That’s right… No way could this really be happening Ichigo would never bring two beauties home It’s like Bon, New Year’s and Christmas all came together… Shut up and get real! Rukia…don’t… What’s with him No cares in the world Yes, well, what do we do now Even if these things are able to sniff those creatures out, I doubt they’ll be willing to talk to us And whether we can capture them… Uh-huh The problem with them is their trickery Like us, our enemies’ powers seem to be various and unique to each of them What a headache…! True When I attacked that monster with my zanpakuto, I caused it no harm at all And I’m not sure what sort of power that other guy has But if we don’t do something, someone else might get his soul sucked out We’ll have to find some way to fight them – Uh-huh – Yeah Doesn’t Soul Society know anything about the Bounts Huh Judging from the timing, isn’t this why you were sent here Unfortunately, I wasn’t told anything That encounter was the first I’d ever heard of Bounts It was a surprise Oh, well…then… Oh…! Yes Rukia! Is that really you, Rukia I just got a message from the Captain! You really are here I’m coming right over! Right over… Renji! Who the hell are you! Huh! Dad… Get off me… Rukia! Don’t, I said… Uh… How far did I get Um… There are these Bounts… It is a mystery what they are and what their objectives and powers are, but there’s no doubt they are dangerous, I would say Are you an idiot What do you mean, “I would say” Anybody who learns nothing after battling someone can only be an idiot! Listen, I don’t want to hear that from some fool who’d break someone’s window to come in! Quit trying to dodge the subject! I’m not dodging anything! Yes, you’re dodging it – Indeed, it is odd… – No, Im not – What is – Idiot Ichigo! Normally, one Soul Reaper is sent out for every 50,000 humans But, including the Substitute, there are three of us I think we should consider our being sent here as a response to this problem Oh, yeah… Hey, what will we do tomorrow If that’s the case, we have no other choice… Hello, everyone…! Good morning, Rukia! You look as pretty as ever Good morning, my honey…! What do you mean, “honey”! I see them every day, but I’ve missed Rukia’s serenity My heart goes out to you I don’t know what you’re talking about, but I will take them as words of praise Huh J-Just a minute! Huh What did you do That… Why are you acting like we just parted yesterday and are meeting again today It’s because we parted yesterday and met again this morning Look at this! It’s a Kikanshinki Delux It’s an amazing gadget that allows me to freely change memories! So, in their memories, I am Rukia Kuchiki, a student who transferred here not long ago, and has started to get used to her class So anything goes now… What are you doing here, Rukia What’s the matter, Ishida N-Nothing… Uh-oh… I forgot to tell him For lunch today, we have French riceballs! I wrapped some custard in rice! There’s enough for Tatsuki and everyone! Okay, okay I’m on a diet, so no thanks Oh, this is delicious The custard that squishes out between the grains of chewy rice is superb Don Kan’onji’s new “Feeling Spirits 5 vs 5” The shoot is open to the public I’ll go! That’s great I can’t go because I have a date You’re going, right, Chad We’ll be two guys having a blast! It’s like… Soul Society didn’t exist at all… Don’t be ridiculous! It’s here! – Huh – Huh Ichigo… I forgot something I’ll be back Huh Huh What is this Chad I can understand, but Orihime and Rukia, too Don’t tell me… Ishida, don’t exert yourself! Well, good-bye, everyone… No! Why have we been left out Probably because of the way you are, Mr Asano “Mr Asano” Why the formality, all of a sudden Orihime… Which way That way! And which is it The man Don’t they become active only after nightfall I guess not After all, our detection ability is very accurate What’s this! Huh It’s money… This won’t do Are you trying to make a fool of me You think you can use money like this Get out! Ouch… How mean… He’s like the men in the Squad 11 – Huh – Hurry! Oh…hey! That face seemed somehow familiar… Pay attention, will you! I know! Don’t worry… Your body will feel no pain Hold it…! Damn you! How rude… There’s something I want to ask you What is it First, you’re a Bount, aren’t you Yes… What happened to the girl, yesterday No comment What is your objective No comment Does that mean you have a scheme you can’t talk about No comment on that, either Now, can I ask you a question A Soul Reaper’s soul and a human’s soul– which tastes better Zeig Dih Friede! So your ability is in that strange whip This is just a start Oh, Friede, are you ready so soon Yes It was easy Then, go and show them your strength All right Watch your step! Ishida…! When… His direct attack on you was a trick He made it seem like he was chasing you, and had laid a trap around you I guess it changes everything it touches into snakes It’s not a matter of touching or not touching Anything that Ryo can imagine will turn into a snake For example… Oh! Oh-oh-oh… What’s going on! All of a sudden there are snakes everywhere! Stop it! Stop! I can’t stand snakes--! Quit babbling! Just get out of here! I hate snakes…! Santenkesshun! I…reject! Can’t you do anything I see… This is interesting To think I’d run into you here… Leave Ishida alone! That is impossible What! He is the most defenseless and weak among you Taking advantage of another’s weakness is an established tactic, isn’t it Besides… I wonder what a Quincy’s soul tastes like… I’d like to find out Where does she think she’s going How naïve This town is truly, more beautiful when it is cloaked in darkness Count one! And move on Count two! And take a break Count three! And think through I’ll just go at my own pace Time goes by, and I get left behind But I say, “don’t forget that anxious feeling” They tell me, “A reckless challenge is meaningless” But I say “don’t give up” (Offense!) At times when the going gets tough, I raise my voice (Offense!)

I’m the one you’re after, aren’t I In that case… you can have me in place of that woman Ishida! You… What are you saying! Don’t be hasty, Ishida!

Dept of Research and Development I’m coming in Huh Isn’t anyone here In that case… I’ll just… No one has said there’s no one here One such as the great Kyoraku is acting like a thief A thief Now thats rude What do you want I may not look like it, but I am quite busy Then I’ll be up front Will you show me some data Data What sort Bounts You know what they are, right Bounts Hmm… That’s a long dust-covered subject But the materials on that subject that should be preserved in the Central Library seem to have disappeared And so, I have only the data here to rely on If it’s such a dust-covered subject, it shouldn’t be a problem showing it to me, right That’s for me to decide Isn’t it going beyond your authority for a captain of another squad to tell me what to do That’s the very reason I’m here If anyone could help me, I was certain that it would be you, the one in charge of the R&D Bureau, whispered to be the most excellent captain in Soul Society… Right If you want to look at our data, you’d better go through the proper channels If I did that, it would take a good three months True The data might not be worth much… but having people go through the proper channels gives my position meaning and authority So…you can’t give me the data Exactly Hope you go to hell someday… Huh Did you say something No, nothing… Oh…“The most excellent…” was just a bit of flattery Huh Though I’ve also heard rumors that you’re worst If you want to hear more, you’ll have to go through the proper channels…! Damn! What’s with that…! That rude attitude! Nemu! The Keys! I’ll show him… I’ll delete all the data on Bounts! Access denied Password required What! I can’t access the data! I don’t remember giving that order! Who has done this! Nemu! What’s this all about! I left you in charge of supervision! You’re good for nothing!

Where are you planning to go You have a destination in mind If we split up, we can find him! Don’t do it We don’t know their objective Maybe, like he did the other day, he might come after whoever is alone… The doll that a Bount manipulates seems to have mysterious powers that exceed those of our zanpakuto If you go after them without a good plan, you’ll be falling right into enemy hands Got you! Got you! I got you! I snuck a boo-boo cushion under his seat! We got a very nice sound out of him! N-No… I just wanted to ease everyone’s tension for a bit… Get lost! Where am I… This… Why did you save me Ah… A dead soul doesn’t taste good, is that it You’re a Quincy, aren’t you Everyone asks me that It must smell very different… a Quincy’s soul Yes, well… Put nicely, it doesn’t smell very tasty All the more, a Quincy that has lost its powers You don’t pull any punches How Huh How did you lose your powers My lack of training, coupled with reaching the limit of my capabilities That’s the only way I can explain it Is that a characteristic of a Quincy Huh Self pity… I should have looked for another Quincy There are no other Quincies Huh There’s only me now… I see…there’s only you… There are no other Quincies… Urahara Store I’ve been debating whether or not to tell you this… The reason we thought of researching Bounts is because there was a special substance contained in the residue In small quantities, that substance poses no problems, but in increasing quantities, there’s a good chance it could affect space Space What about it Won’t you explain it in more detail In other words, it becomes possible to create something like a tunnel to connect two mutually exclusive spaces So that would mean… Quit drawing! It’ll just make it more confus–! Shh! World of the Living 		Tunnel Is this what you mean Yes…well… It becomes possible to connect this world with Hueco Mundo– the narrow world in which the Hollows dwell If that happens, many living beings will be sucked into Hueco Mundo! Yes… Besides, Soul Society has been using the time it takes for a Hollow to appear in this world to base how they station the Soul Reapers If the Hollows are able to easily get from there to here… They could call out every single Soul Reaper, and we still wouldn’t be able to handle them! Yes For the Hollows, it would probably be a soul-eating free-for-all Of course, this is just a possibility, you understand How much of a possibility I’d say… about this much Five…percent Don’t joke! You mean, 50 percent! We’ve received word…from Ishida! What! Ishida! It hurts my injuries, so next time, will you please enter more quietly You’re all right Thank goodness Sorry, but I’m still alive Can you tell us about it Yeah… What in the world happened That female Bount… She told me an unbelievable story Listen quietly to me Then I won’t have to hurt you We Bounts have, for a long time, had a rule that must never be broken We must never suck out the soul of a living person… Do you know why No… If we did that, we Bounts would obtain immense energy, that would cause us to  affect space Affect space… What do you mean For example, we could go to the afterworld But that would undermine the balance of the world That is why no one had thought to do anything like that, until now But… now a Bount has appeared, who is trying to do just that That man’s name is… Jin Kariya You attacked humans, too But I failed In order to fight Kariya, I was in need of more strength But I no longer want to do it Rules should never be broken… I intend to use the power I have now to defeat Kariya and to put a stop to his ambition What has that got to do with me Kariya will be sure to come after you now No matter what, I want you to survive I wanted to let you know that He’s coming after me Why The outcome of this whole situation… will depend upon a Quincy After that, I lost consciousness… When I came to, I was here in this hospital Why a Quincy, I wonder… I didn’t get around to asking her about that Can we believe that story I don’t know… But… Ishida Huh Oh… But she brought me back safely, like this I don’t believe it’s all a bad joke Anyway, if they’re going to be coming after Ishida, we’ve got to do something Yeah Don’t worry, Ishida We’ll protect you! Thanks… Well, then we’ll go back to the shop We have to come up with a plan right away Yeah… We’ll see Mr Urahara out You’d better rest awhile, Ishida Long ago, I saw a face like that… Mom… Mom… Are you crying, Mom That’s right… Mom looked like she might be laughing, yet she was crying… Are you sure… letting Yoshino roam freely like that Kariya! There’s no way she can leave me I have taken steps… Count one! And move on Count two! And take a break Count three!

And think through I’ll just go at my own pace Time goes by, and I get left behind But I say, “don’t forget that anxious feeling” They tell me, “A reckless challenge is meaningless” But I say “don’t give up” (Offense!)

That seems to be a valuable marionette… Its just old I dont think it has any value… Kariya is worried Dont you think you should return I dont follow anyones orders Even if its an order from the man you love Even love grows old… It definitely grows old, especially if you think youre being controlled It appears Kariya… is making his move soon… I dont care Bounts are self-reliant Just let him do what he wants… Why is Kariya so soft on you You seem so slow to me… Youre much more of a boy than you look The world doesnt move on just momentum Unnecessary ambition will destroy you… No comment Really! I’m off for the night! Starting tomorrow, I’ll be working hard! That storeowner sure was kind to let me work here He even let me have the remaining packed lunches By the way, Ganju… Huh Whyd you come here Big Sis felt a strange presence so she told me to investigate… Is that so Then thats the same as me Captain Unohana also ordered me… We both have it rough, dont we!

Right! Lets go! But what happened all of a sudden I dont know Those twin brats… Whats wrong They never attacked separately… Come to think of it… It feels as if… they control that doll by combining their powers… Theyre using that resonance phenomenon which twins are said to have, huh Thats why they can combine their dolls into one… Together, theyre complete If thats the case… Is that Koga Its dark I can read This is fine… Youre the same as always, I see Dry your clothes Youll catch a cold… Ill pour you some tea at ten oclock Don’t trouble yourself By the way, what happened to everyone else Youre the first one… A place with no water This place is leaking! Sorry… Its better than outside Sado Hmm Ishida has a fever… This is bad… Everyone… Just leave me here… No way! Thanks for your concern, but… I dont want to be a burden on you any longer!

Whered you go! All right, this is good! Keep it up! Can you take them further away Noba! This is the best I can do… Just a little further! You! All right, were back You saved us, Noba… Theyre one person in two… They were controlling two dolls by sharing their thoughts via resonance Conversely, if one loses consciousness, they cant resonate… So neither one can control their dolls Isnt that right, Noba! Thats right! Ban! Ban! Ban! Wake up! Please wake up! Nows our chance! Youve lost! Give up! What I can do this! I can! I can do this by myself! Zeige dih Ghoul! Shakkaho! Red Flame Cannon! Do it, Ghoul! Here it comes! Its useless! We dont have enough firepower! Shakkaho! Where are you aiming! I can do this by myself! Damn! Its around here Lets go, Hana! Yes! Huh! Seppa! Ghoul!

Well, just watch Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!  Hot! Hot! Hot! Wh-Whats this! Whats going on! Theyve turned to dust! Even though they looked like children, they were probably past their limits as living beings… Losing their dolls may have pushed them past that point… Huh Whats wrong, Inoue Wheres Ishida-- Master Kariya, welcome back Yes, good work as usual Not at all You suck up! Udagawa, where are Ho and Ban It seems that they were defeated Their presence has disappeared I see… Count one! And move on Count two! And take a break Count three!

Ishida! Ishida! Ishida, that bastard Hes just acting tough! I hope hes not thinking that he doesnt want to be a burden! Throwing away his own friends… Thats harsh I wont let him do that! Thats right! Its not even trash day! Y-Youre mad Thats unusual… Of course! Im going to find him and treat his wounds! Earlier… If I had used the last of my strength, maybe… Just maybe… I could have thrown her off my trail But I didnt do that Why Why did I save you Is that what you want to know Its because you had lonely eyes… Is that a good enough answer Youre being targeted by the Bounts Youd be putting your friends in danger if you stayed with them Thats why you ran away What a sad story… No ones happy So you felt sorry for me You dont seem like the type who would be sentimental like that I was once like that… There was a time when I saw sweet sentimental dreams Those feeling have just become cold… because of the mind-numbing passage of time Thats some noise… I can feel it echoing through my body Thats because youre not used to it Im used to hearing it, so I no longer feel anything The sound of the bells or the passing of time… Is that how youve watched this town all this time Uninvolved with anyone and all alone… Strangely… Theres a lack of reality when… I watch those people restlessly living from here I dont feel loneliness Youre one of the Bounts Dont you even live with them There was a time when I did That was a long time ago… A long time… For a time so long that it numbs the mind, weve lived in the shadow of history During that time… countless numbers of us have endured harsh experiences and borne indescribable treatment With that behind us, the time when we Bounts can be released from the darkness… is finally approaching This long time… may be what plants fleeting dreams and foolish ambition in us Bounts Everything…because of time… How strange… You hate time so much… And yet, you live next to this clock Could it be that youre still expecting something You want to live rather than observe the passage of time Is that what youre thinking If its possible… I suppose Id like to die Die When you have eternal life, you feel like you can do anything You begin to think that youve become a god Isnt that foolish Now then… Kariya could you tell us Why have you gathered us here A Quincy has been found Oh… Thats interesting I want you to help me! We chosen Bounts must catch this Quincy! To gain greater absolute power… and for our shining era! What! Maki Ichinoses Spiritual Pressure Yes It has been undeniably confirmed to be in the World of the Living Right, Aramaki Huh Yes… Weve never been able to find him, no matter how hard we looked We were suddenly able to track his Spiritual Pressure I overheard Captain Hitsugaya and Captain Ukitake talking about it earlier Then, then, Maki-maki… Is Maki in the World of the Living right now It seems so Is that so, Maki-maki! Maki is alive, Maki-maki! E-Excuse me, but thats confusing, so could you not repeat my name What Why Youre Maki-maki and Maki is Maki! Theyre completely different! Im saying that its confusing! Isn’t the nickname Maki-maki… kind of weird Yes… I mean, dont ask me that! What is he doing Who knows… What should we do Leave him alone! But I feel a bit responsible… Ken-chan, dont you feel it too I dont care Wait! Zaraki… You… How dare you do this to the Captain! I wont accept this! Huh Whats with you Please stop, Ichinose! Let me go! Under the attendance of 200 squad members, the winner of this match and the new captain of Squad Eleventh is… Kenpachi Zaraki! You arent allowed to draw your sword here! How boring… Listen up, all of you! Im going to do things my way! I wont chase those who leave! Do as you like! Eleven Maki! Are you really going to leave Im very sorry You’re still holding a grudge against Ken-chan… No… That was an official one-on-one match Captain Zaraki did nothing wrong Then why I really can’t find a reason to remain here Also… My captain will always… be our former captain Do as you like Thank goodness hes still alive Back then, he looked as if he would just die Hes probably being forced to live… But I dont know who’d do that… Mr Ichinose, what do you suppose Kariyas real objective is What does he plan to do when he catches the Quincy Who knows I do not question I simply obey Master Kariya Because its easier that way… If you always completely agree or disagree… theres no reason to think What are you thinking Who knows… Im still thinking Ishida! Hmm Oh… Sorry… Damn… Where in the world did you go! Ishida! It sure is miserable here You should put… I try not to own things Its easier that way Its too much of a burden to own things That may be true There are times when the things you should be thankful for… feel like a burden Another day is about to end… When I look down at humans from here, I think… we live for hundreds of years Humans are so short-sighted compared to us But that short-sightedness… Its because people only have a few decades in which they can try hard… Thats why theyre happy Long ago… when I was still a child… I came to have this odd feeling that I was not like normal people… Since then, Ive kept that fact a secret I was desperate to keep that… a secret even from my friends… But then I realized… that it was impossible for them not to notice Everyone around me was aging like they should People…and history… It seemed like only I was left behind… Never changing Unable to change… I was at such a loss… Time had passed I was forever left behind by the times… Find her! Find her! Shes a witch! Shes got to be a witch! Kill her! Kill her! I had tired of living… Day by day I thought only of ways to die… And when I decided to end my own life… He appeared Theres no need to be afraid… Im like you Kariya, huh He told me to live with him He said there were reasons for Bounts like us to live Ill tell you my reason for living Its you Remember this… A Bounts love is deep, long… limitless, and continues eternally God has given Bounts our time of bliss… Eternal love… There was a time when I truly believed that But not now Ive realized that the word “eternal” exists for humans who have limited life spans… Its something that has no meaning to us Bounts In other words… does that mean that your love for him…Kariya… came to an end There may not have been any love to begin with… The light of hope I saw was an illusion An illusion He tricked my eyes with a bright veil of light… only to hide his ambition in its shadow Ambition The Power Hold… Kariya has gathered the few Bounts that are left… and is probably trying to go to Hueco Mundo… Hes trying to gain limitless power there In order to make the Bounts… no, himself an ultimate god! Thats crazy! If he does that, hell deviate from the principal rules which we must uphold! God has no rules to follow… Rules are for God to decide Even so! Thats why Ive brought you here To keep Kariya from doing that! Umm… Do you… still love him Stop! I cant forgive him… In order for me to remain human, however little that may be… I cant forgive him for losing his human heart What do you mean He took a living persons soul… with the same mouth with which he told me he loved me… I couldnt forgive Kariya for that… but I couldnt forgive myself even more for being unable to stop him… How ironic He gave me the hope to live, but by his betrayal, I awakened to… the little that remained of my heart as a human which slept within me… What do you plan to do now Im going to defeat Kariya How! Id help you if I could but, I no longer can… You sure are kind to want to help me… But I don’t intend to rely on you any longer Ill deal with him myself You should just stay in this room until your wounds heal Do you have any hope of winning Of course If its possible, Id like to die… Thats a lie! A lie Why do you think that W-Well… Please Try not to be captured by Kariyas men I dont know why, but youre a key person in Kariyas goal But I no longer have any powers… You cant be sure of that Am I wrong I have the feeling that the Quincy power still lies within you Live… Wait! Umm… Theres one thing I realized earlier… I could have run away from you if I had wanted to… But I didnt… Now I finally know why Why Your eyes I may have seen a small ray of hope from your lonesome eyes… You havent fallen completely into despair You have a beautiful light that seeks hope… Well… If its possible, Id like to help you… I dont know what I can do in this condition, but… Even so… Even so, Ill go with you! You sure are good-natured despite your looks Count one! And move on Count two! And take a break Count three! And think through I’ll just go at my own pace Time goes by, and I get left behind But I say, “don’t forget that anxious feeling” They tell me, “A reckless challenge is meaningless” But I say “don’t give up” (Offense!)

And head toward the direction of my goal There is nothing to be afraid of that towering wall Never losing sight in this life without answers Keep My Pace Count one! And move on Count two! And take a break Count three! And think through I’ll just go at my own pace Theres a Soul Reaper among the enemy Hes probably a good-for-nothing… Probably a dangerous battle maniac or a crazy-eyed modification maniac Oh Who might that be Id like to hear more Im sorry!

That was close What are you doing Nows not the time to be protecting me… I didnt protect you… Huh I just decided I wouldnt run away I no longer want to be a burden… nor will I be made a key person! Oh, how wonderful! Im delighted! What a nice manly thing to say! You make me want to hug you! Theres no mistake! Its already disappeared, but there was a sign of two Bounts! Thats fine, but try not to be seen by people… What do you mean by that! How rude! Thats not what I mean Its strange for four stuffed animals to be walking around… Stop calling me strange! Im serious! I didnt choose this look to begin with Im putting up with this because I cant get out of it… Fine, fine! Is that so… Oh! Its here! Oh ho This is definitely suspicious! Hm There are traces of Ishidas Spiritual Pressure! Huh! Youre right! Ishida! Ishida… Theres no mistake Ishida was brought here… Theres fire Which means its that woman and… The other one… is someone we dont know It looks like they were fighting over the Quincy… I think so, too They were fighting for Ishida… This set up… is it a “Princess Uryu Ishida Story”! No! How disgusting! No… It kind of matches… Hot! Im burning! That was hot… Noba… You can suck in flames Isnt it hot Not a problem Ichigo! Huh Ishidas bandages… Can someone follow Ishidas Spirit Ribbon Its no good… Ishidas Spiritual Pressure is very weak and hes suppressing it That bastard… He wont even let us know if hes been caught by Bounts! Its all right! Thats right Its all right In this situation, we may be able to follow the Bounts reishi residue! Really Yes, but Im frustrated… My powers would be better if I was in a gigai! We mod-souls real bodies are small pills… We cant walk or even speak unless someone puts us in a gigai… Say, Ive always thought it was strange, but… If thats the case, then why dont you put each other into your gigai Wh-Whats up with that! He didnt have to tell me I knew that! I knew, but I just acted like I didnt! Well, how could I have missed that! This is definitely an example of people not being aware of their surroundings, or a Copernican revolution! I knew! I knew, but I was acting dumb on purpose! Of course, I was! At any rate, lets go after the Bounts! Yes! What! What about me! Im the only stuffed animal! Wait for me! Tenth Squad Captain Hitsugaya, and Lieutenant Rangiku Matsumoto Eleventh Squad Captain Zaraki, and Lieutenant Yachiru Kusajishi – Entering – Entering Sorry to keep you waiting! What were you doing at a time like this! If you were regular squad members you would be my pet’s food because you were incompetent! Captain Ukitake, what did you want to talk to us about Im the one who wanted to talk! I summoned everyone here because… General Captain Yamamoto is not here today Now then Twelfth Squad Captain Kurotsuchi will explain the details… There are no details! Its my databank! Someone has been breaking in and looking at it! Looking at it Looking at what Would it surprise you if I said…Bounts Furthermore, the enemy planted a trap! It would destroy all the data if it was removed! Do you know what this means! Do you! This is both a challenge and a great insult towards me, the head of the Department of Research and Development If someone here is involved with the culprit, give me your name immediately! Ill pickle you in a pool of acid! Stop picking a fight, Kurotsuchi… Were high-ranking officials of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads… Have you already forgotten that just recently… we were betrayed by that so-called high-ranking official This is a dangerous problem which involves all of Soul Society We shouldnt act hastily… Humph! How unreliable! Well fine… But if anyone does anything else to make me look foolish… be prepared, because I have a plan! I have a bad feeling about this… Huh What about This Kurotsuchi incident and the fact that we found Ichinose What! Why I dont know… You are worried about Maki, after all It’s not that It just all seems fishy… Ive figured it out! Theres a mansion that fits the description a little further down from here Huh There seems to be an incredibly rich man who lives there, but no one has ever seen him… Kariya wont forgive you anymore If you think Im lying, then come out of this room and meet Kariya It seems you cant even get up You shouldnt try anything stupid like using your doll in that condition Youll be attacked So this is it… What a huge garden… I cant see the house… Theres no mistake! This is it! All right! Lets split up and search for him! Come in Excuse me Would you like to see the Quincy Koga caught him, huh Yes Hes in the hall right now Hes our valuable trump card… Ill greet him Shall I advance our plans No… Why are you holding back I dont understand We’ve lived for a long time… In that time, all of our memories have become coated in gray… For the first time in a while, I can see the world in color Is it wrong if I wish to enjoy this a little longer I understand, however… Silence! Udagawa, you dont understand! Thats it… Whats wrong, Rukia The Bounts Spiritual Pressure Being this close I can clearly tell; even without the mod-souls… There are…five, six, seven… eight of them… Really! Since we dont know their plan, we can’t waste time! Lets go! Whats wrong Are you afraid So youre Ishida Its natural to be cautious Weve given you quite a rough invitation Who are you Jin Kariya… I wish to borrow your Quincy powers In order to gain the power of Hueco Mundo Theres no changing the fact that we are both rejected beings… due to our unique abilities Unique abilities… Thats right I have a proposition Can we live cooperatively together, instead of acting like enemies Bounts can protect you No, we may be able to revive your lost power Dont you think thats a good proposition You know I have no powers, so why I told you Were the same Do you think Ill believe you Its understandable to be suspicious But we have time I can wait until you understand Forever in fact… You can make yourself at home Do you plan on confining me here Youre an important guest Dalk, thats enough Oh, too bad I see… This is my prison Kariya is a kind, but terrifying person Im warning you Thank you for your consideration Youll understand soon… Huh We headed straight towards the mansion, didnt we Yes Hmm… I wonder which way it is I havent been able to get a hold of my sense of direction… Me too Hey! Woah! Ow! Wait for me! Darn! This is also the wrong way! This mansion has too many extensions! No, thats not the only thing… Huh Something is messing up our senses… Could it be mineral veins or the effects of a strong magnetic force! Weve been discovered! Whats this! You bastard! Red Flame Cannon! What is this Who knows… But this is bad! Huh Look! At any rate, lets run away! Hey! Oh no! Damn! I dont want to make a big fuss, but… Lirin! Ichigo! Oh ho! Could those things coming behind you be…! Noba! Erase them! You saved us… Why are you here We had no choice! The house was filled with those strange eyeball dolls! Noba erased them, but they just kept creeping out There was no end to it! Thats why we went outside… But we didnt expect them to be outside as well… Im tired… It seems they wont let us rest! Oh…here they come Why you! I cant take this any more! Lets go! Where are we Oh… Thats a pretty impressive tapestry This depicts witch hunting… Yes…thats right… Who are you!

Ichigo… Yeah… I am Jin Kariya Pleased to meet you, Ichigo Kurosaki How do you know my name I know… Is the lady next to you the Soul Reaper Rukia Kuchiki Rukia… Whats wrong Are you surprised Being surprised means youre afraid –What did you say! –Rukia, dont let them get to you! Thats right Nothing they say can get to us They’re not falling for it Noba! Th-This is bad! Bad! Bad! This is really bad! Bad! Bad! This is bad! His eyes… What a disgusting glare… Ichigo…be careful I know… We came to get Ishida back We cant give him back to you… We need the Quincy Even if hes important to you, thats not what Ishida wants! Then what are you going to do about it Well take him back by force! Can you I can! Rukia! All right! Zeig dih, Friede! You’re not getting away! I’m not letting you go through here! You… Ichigo! Its all right! Take care of Ishida! Be careful! Seven against one, huh What are you talking about Huh We Bounts are independent We would never fight in a group Especially against the likes of a single Soul Reaper substitute Im good enough by myself What You dont believe me All right Kariya… Can you remove your crest Crest The crest is our source of power It allows us to summon our dolls… Bounts dont have any attack power if they dont have their dolls… I shall take the time to… watch your fight Now, if the other Bounts attack you, you can attack Kariya without worry He has no way to block your attacks I dont really understand whats going on, but at any rate, Im going to cut you down! Youre full of openings Ive got you! Will Ichigo be all right by himself Hes not an idiot He knows that this battle is for buying time to find Ishida Even so, we dont know the Bounts’ abilities very well We should gather and analyze more information… –to make a plan… –Aww… Shut up! He can analyze that while hes fighting! Why do you think weve come along How trivial! I dont like the way you said that I was worried about him! Really! We can always use Nobas ability to go directly to Ichigo! Ah! When we find Ishida, well use Nobas space displacement to escape this mansion Its possible within this area, isnt it Not a problem Wh-What is this This conversation makes me look like the only idiot! Isn’t everyone being a little rude! Hey! Most of the Bounts in this mansion… are concentrated in that room back there, arent they Yeah! Theres one more further in… Hes probably keeping watch over Ishida… Who is it A Soul Reaper That deduction is wrong The Bount you sensed is a traitor who is being held with the Quincy Is it the Bount who saved Ishida Thats right Are you…allied with the Bounts Ex-Thirteen Court Guard Squads… Eleventh Squad, Maki Ichinose Ex-Eleventh Squad Thats right… During the time of the last captain A run-away Soul Reaper, huh Why are you here Well… –What –No way! Making me see hallucinations as you move through space to attack me from behind A good idea, but its just a childish trick Hes…strong… Youre a Soul Reaper, too, arent you Thirteenth Squad, Rukia Kuchiki Why are you in a gigai How about drawing your zanpakuto… Unfortunately due to certain circumstances, I cant use it now… But… Hado 33: Sokatsui! Im surprised… You can do Eishohaki You dont seem surprised at all Eishohaki weakens the power of Kido And yet you have this much power Plus, you arent using your true power Im not sure what the idea is, but this isnt your true power, is it I would hate for you to overestimate me That was my full power Well, in my current state… My power hasnt entirely returned… Well, thats fine then… Why are you helping the Bounts Do you know how to become a captain of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads What Thats right The method that spread Kenpachi Zarakis name throughout Seireitei… Zaraki… became captain of the Eleventh Squad with only his own power And with that, the ideal which the previous captain and I had built ended as a fleeting dream Everything… was destroyed in that instant! I didnt want to follow Kenpachi Zaraki like the other squad members… Is that why…you ran away Jin Kariya gave me a reason to live again I lost everything, but I was able to pick up my zanpakuto again… For him He lives forever… and is searching for what lies beyond that by breaking all the restrictions I plan to lay everything I have on the line once more for this man Is that why youre helping him It seems Ive said too much Sorry, but… I cant let you pass This Spiritual Pressure Kurosaki and the others are here! Open up! Open this up! Kurosaki, dont do anything rash! I have to get out… What Youre going to make a snake come out of there again! Friede! Even your sword cannot cut Friede So it seems… Then I guess I have to attack you directly! How Like this! Flash Step, huh I wont miss next time! Thats pretty good… How sloppy I dont plan on helping a weakling I know Is everything in place Of course What are you whispering about! Im already finished What! Damn! What is this! Snake Net What did you say! Its Friedes absolute field You cant run away anymore Do you know the term… “spinal reflex” Its what happens when you touch something hot and react without the signal reaching your brain What about it Thats what this Snake Net is! Even if you try to approach me with Flash Step… You cant match Friedes reaction speed You cant escape anywhere How do you know about Flash Step It was inevitable that Soul Society would try to stop our actions Its only natural that we learned about Soul Reapers, isnt it What Thats enough talk Go, Friede! I know Its useless Its over! How trivial Kariya, Im sorry I damaged your mansion It doesnt matter Oh my, are you finished How sloppy… What should I do Shall I chase down those who ran away Ichinose’s on the move Let him handle them Ichinose, huh Besides that, his other friends are still nearby Understood… Heh… Dont think I’m dead just yet! Why you… From what you said, it seems that Rukia and the others are in danger… Then Ive got to finish up here and head over there! What can you do in that condition Your attack isnt affecting me as much as you think! I see… What incredible Spiritual Pressure Is that what protected your body Pretty much… I can envelop my body in strong Spiritual Pressure… to nullify my opponents attacks I didnt fight in Soul Society for nothing! Id like to tell you that its quite a feat, but theres no way to escape from Friedes field Im going to crush your body with an attack that surpasses that Spiritual Pressure Sorry I dont plan on running away or giving my body to your snake! Friede! Yeah Here I go! Ill tear you into pieces! Getsugatensho! What is this! What is this Spiritual Pressure Ichigo! Master Kariya! Wait! Hado 33! That Spiritual Pressure was a Getsugatensho… Darn! Ichigo! Kurosaki! What should we do Anyway, just run! Come to think of it, this is your hideout Im not bothering anyone! I didnt have to hold back with my Getsugatensho You repelled Udagawas technique with only raw power… What an amusing man… Why you… What a reckless guy… Still… This is… Friede… This was my favorite mansion Its ruined Im sorry about that Shall I tear it apart I wouldnt like that… Whats with his confidence Whats this! What are you doing, Udagawa Kariya…Im taking your crest Udagawa… Koga…do you think that things will go well doing things Kariyas way Kariyas method is too roundabout Do you think you could do a better job Of course I dont trust you Kariya was in charge until now because he had power But his crest is right here I was waiting for a chance to steal his crest… but I didnt think it would be so easy What is this A fight among allies Thats incorrect I told you earlier that Bounts are independent We rarely help each other… We are few in number, but in order to advance to a new stage, we need an excellent leader… –Someone like me, not Kariya… –Thats impossible for you Stop acting tough! I have your crest right here! What about it Kariya, are you delirious I said that your crest, the source of your power, is here in my hand! In other words, you are now powerless Its possible not only for me… but that Soul Reaper substitute boy to defeat you! Udagawa, why are you so panicked I am always calm! Youre the one whos actually panicked Now kneel down to me as your leader! Your crest is… Dont make me keep saying it So what Kariya! What The only thing that can block a dolls attack is a doll… Could it be… Did I say that I removed my crest Curse you! Ichinose! A Soul Reaper What! Dont interfere! Wh-Whats this! Its over This is…impossible… Whats with that zanpakuto Nijigasumi My zanpakuto Nijigasumi! Master Kariya, Im glad youre safe… Theres no problem Hey! Why in the world is a Soul Reaper here It seems that you beat Kenpachi Zaraki… What Ex-Eleventh Squad, Maki Ichinose What did you say Why are you helping the Bounts Youre going to die Theres no need for you to know Come on! I see… I have to beat it out of you, huh! Here I go! Sky blue dreams shine and flicker, dancing away into the sky The flowers glow and fade away The sky falls silent, as a pair of dreamy fireworks (Hanabi) lit up I will sing my piercing love to you Can you hear my voice Blooming in an instant are fireworks (Hanabi) Sky blue dreams shine and flicker, dancing away into the sky Blossom away in full bloom, high above Protect and keep those feelings thriving Strongly, at least till the very end These flowers will glow and fade away Lirin, how does a Bounts Spiritual Pressure differ from a regular Soul Reaper or a Hollow It tastes different A Soul Reapers Spiritual Pressure is refreshing A Hollows Spiritual Pressure is smooth and rich A Bounts Spiritual Pressure is a bit thick Something like that Understand Not at all The Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers Golden after these messages! Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! Golden! We shall begin our regular lieutenant meeting Today, we shall hear our first topic from Lieutenant Kusajishi… Umm…uhh… Are bananas considered as a snack to bring… on Hollow extermination missions What do you think That fruit is an excellent source of nourishment We should probably consider it as different than a snack Yea! Byak-kun, you really understand things! Why is Captain Kuchiki here Ill slice you if you dont tune in again!"

What A Soul Reaper Dont interfere! Whats this Its over Hey! Why in the world is a Soul Reaper here Youre going to die Theres no need for you to know I have to beat it out of you, huh! Here I go! Kurodo! Noba! They took an attack from a skilled Soul Reaper They should have taken a lot of damage… Whatll we do What if they were to die like this! If Noba and Kurodo arent around… Ill be all alone! Come on, wake up! Open your eyes! Noba! Kurodo! Kurodo! –Hey, Kurodo! –I wonder if I can –circulate the ki to heal –Wake up! –in my current state… –I wont call you stupid anymore! Wake up! Kurodo! No! Kurodo! Stop it But… Hey… Stop pretending to be unconscious already… Huh Good morning! What about Noba Kurodo! Well, we were like dying swans, but we couldnt leave you alone after hearing your voice We came back right before reaching the River Styx… Owowowow…my chronic cramps… Idiot! You sure have your share of troubles with them… Here I go! Its useless to try to escape! You cannot see my sword, no matter how you struggle! Dont underestimate me! Is it just instinct You shouldnt be seeing my Nijigasumis attacks… But youre reflexively dodging it… Thats interesting Heh! Thats the power of your zanpakuto, huh In that case… In that case I’ll just keep attacking! Things wont go quite so smoothly! Where are you! Now have a taste… of my true power! Flash and burst, Nijigasumi! When my Nijigasumi shines, its light will shine through everything There are no longer any shadows to hide in You shaped highly-dense Spiritual Pressure into a blade and threw it You used that power to cause an explosion under your feet to escape… But it seems to have put a huge strain on you… Shut up! Wait Master Kariya… Ill do this You dont have to do something like this Im interested in his soul… As you wish… Hey, you! What are you talking about! Sorry to keep you waiting… Now live with us… Forever No thanks I wont be eaten! Master Kariya… You charmed me with that strength Your power hasnt changed since I met you… Why! Unfortunately, its acceptable A single combat match under the attendance of over two hundred squad members to show supremacy It’s one way to succeed a position in the Thirteen Court Guard Squad He accepted that mans challenge Were not allowed to stop him But Soul Society needs a will like that of our captain’s… Thats what I have believed in… I have the same feelings Soul Society is supposed to wish for the peace of souls How could a law like this exist That man, Kenpachi Zaraki, is especially dangerous His sword is madness itself… Captain! Wait! Zaraki…you… How dare you do this to the captain! I wont accept it! Please stop, Ichinose! Let me go! At that moment, the captain I respected was taken from me Is it all right for a battle to be so meaningless, a battle between those who only seek strength I couldnt stop trembling with anger But in the end, everyone stopped me from attacking him there… And… Soon, Zaraki officially became captain of Squad 11 Huh A one on one fight Forget it… I am officially challenging you to a fight… How could you Youre different from me You can become captain by taking the captains exam… I dont intend to hold a grudge against you But I cannot leave my late captain unavenged Humph So thats it… What a pain… You can’t cut me What! Do it right now if you want to! If you can give me even a scratch, Ill consider it! Whats wrong Come on! Flash and burst, Nijigasumi! I told you… You cant cut me… Why-- Why are you like that Youre like ivy… You cant live… unless youre clinging on to trees… Because youre ivy… Learn to plant some roots to stand on your own… I didnt care about anything… I died at that moment… Thats what I thought… Until I met Kariya… I left Soul Society At the end of my travels, I found myself in the World of the Living Why…Why am I here Why am I… Its a great crime to come to the World of the Living without permission I can no longer return to Soul Society… Will I…wither away here like this Thats fine… If I do that, I can go to my captain… Save us! A fire Dont come! Souls! Whats going on A hollow! Run away! Quickly, run away! At that moment, my body moved before I could think… But… Humph… Is that all, Soul Reaper Right now… I may not even stand a chance against someone like this… Today sure is great… I filled my stomach with fresh souls and now I get to eat a Soul Reaper… Am I going to die here I can die And yet… What crossed my mind was not the relief that I could finally die… But the fear of death… I was pitiful… I learned how lowly and small I was But even then, I could not let go of my dying body… Its over, Soul Reaper! Wh-What did you do Are you all right Oh, yes… He completely stopped the Hollow’s movement with a single finger Ive never heard of such a person… This is your fight… Here… Soul Reaper Whats wrong You dont seem like youd lose to a Hollow like that… Ive failed Youre ivy… You cant live unless you cling on to trees… Theres no need to be concerned Everyone has a weakness We cant throw those away, no matter how long we live… As long as were within the cycle of rebirth… Wont you come with me I was charmed in an instant… Your soul will meld with mine… If you do that, glory will forever shine upon your head How about it Wont you entrust yourself to me… for wealth you have never known I told you, I refuse! I see… Thats too bad Damn! I-I cant move! Youre not quite what I thought you were… I have no strength… Master Kariya… Arent you going to finish him off This person wont color my world as richly as the Quincy… Do as you like with him… Wait! Damn it… What’s going on! I should definitely finish him off! What! All right, thats great, Ururu! Next, ten degrees to the right at the same angle! – Okay – All right! Yoruichi! Shunko! Look out! I-Is it an earthquake! Thunder! Or a fire! Is it Dad! This is bad! At times like this, we should calm down and escape without making a fuss! – Calm down! – Yes… Whats this Whats going on! This way! I can sense Ishidas Spiritual Pressure beyond this door! What! Kuchiki! Ishida! Are you all right! Y-Yeah… Well, thank goodness youre all right! I was desperately trying to think of a eulogy in case something had happened, – but it ended up being useless… – Now lets run away! I sense a Bount in this room! Whats wrong, Ishida What could it be Help me! What are you saying! Shes a Bount! Shes different! But shes the one who first attacked us… Whats the meaning of this Ill explain later! All right… Noba! Whats going on all of a sudden! Kurosaki… Wait! Sado, weve got to go quickly… No… This way Kurosaki! Dont worry Its not serious Thank goodness… Sister! My beloved… Level brea--! Oh, its nice to see everyones safe! And what a coincidence! Weve all gathered here! I searched for Spiritual Pressures and created an exit… Its not a coincidence – Can you stand – Yeah… We cant linger here Weve got to leave as soon as possible! It seems theyve taken Yoshino and the Quincy with them Sorry I let my guard down Master Kariya, at this rate the plan will… Let them go But… Yoshino will… come back to me… And… That Quincy as well… Sky blue dreams shine and flicker, dancing away into the sky The flowers glow and fade away The sky falls silent, as a pair of dreamy fireworks (Hanabi) lit up I will sing my piercing love to you Can you hear my voice Blooming in an instant are fireworks (Hanabi) Sky blue dreams shine and flicker, dancing away into the sky Blossom away in full bloom, high above Protect and keep those feelings thriving Strongly, at least till the very end These flowers will glow and fade away Darn! I dont think I can win like this For times like this, shall I lend you my underground training area Right now it even comes with an instructor Hello, Im the instructor –Why you! –Huh Who are you talking about –Im the instructor –No, Im talking about you –Shut up, be quiet! –Why!

" Woke up with yawning, its dawning Im still alive Turned on my radio To start up new day As goddamned DJ chattered How to survive Amazing news got over On that air wave Tonight, Love is rationed Tonight, Across the nation Tonight Love reflects world wide Almost another day Shes a shooting star Good-night, good-night Shes a shooting star Good-bye… Tonight, Love is rationed Tonight, Across the nation Tonight Love reflects world wide Almost another day See you some other day Jinta… What do you want –There… –Umm, this isnt child birth You didnt have to boil that much water… Shut up! It may be of some use! Im healing them with a special method Hot water is not needed Really! Are you stupid Ha! What did you say! Why you… Youre just a stuffed animal! Wh-What are you doing! Stop…stop…! Youre stinky! Youre dirty all over… H-Hey… All right! Ill clean you right now! Huh! Aaah…That feels good… The water temperature is just right… Stop relaxing! Stop! My stuffing is coming out! Keep it quiet We have injured people in here! Keep it quiet! Sorry… Kurosaki… Excuse me… Can you be a little more cheerful The air is stagnant! Ugh…its bleak… So whats the new information from Soul Society There was progress at the Department of Research and Development… Whats that Im in charge of the Department of Research and Development There shouldnt be any data I cant browse I removed the lock It took a bit of time, though… I shall explain Nemu! Yes I am bringing it up on the monitor These are Bounts The ones who are causing a stir in the World of the Living Theyre a tribe that, while human, extend their life-spans by feeding off of the human souls… You dim-wit! Quickly! Yes And as you know, these are Quincies… In the past, these two tribes… the Bounts and the Quincies clashed The Stealth Force took this footage at that time… Take a look at this The Bounts are clearly targeting this Quincy… What happens next This is a pretty old record Its all I have… A “to be continued…” I want to know how it played out… I dont know if the Bounts of that time got that Quincy But according to my records… Nemu! Explain what happened afterwards Yes Afterwards, it seems they continued to feed on and absorb the souls of living humans for a while What Originally there existed a kind of law amongst the Bounts; where it was prohibited to absorb souls unless they’re from dead humans But after this incident, it’s apparent that the Bounts continued to absorb souls off of living bodies It’s evident in the data showing a decrease in the quantity of souls… Dont say anything unnecessary! What happened afterwards I dont know… But whenever they make a large-scale movement, they break their laws and attack living humans Furthermore, for some reason, they need a certain Quincy… Whether these current incidences are related to these old records… I dont know… But this much is sure… The Bounts will begin to openly attack humans Living humans, that is… Yoruichi…Is that for real It might have been different if it was someone else, but… Jushiro Ukitake, of all people, was in a panic when he came to let me know Theres no reason to question it Kariya is trying to use Ishidas Quincy power to open a hole to Hueco Mundo… Is that why they need the energy from the souls of living humans Furthermore, why does he need Quincy abilities to do that Right now we only have circumstantial evidence… We cant easily make a decision At any rate, weve got to stop Kariya and the other Bounts –from seriously attacking humans… –Yoruichi… What Theres one thing I dont understand… Theyre sucking the souls of living humans and trying to use the Quincy power… just to go to the Hollow World… What does he… What does Kariya plan to do We wouldnt have any problems if we knew Hes… Powerful enough as he is… What does he plan to do by gaining even greater power Ichigo…you… Hes incredibly strong… Hes not using cheap techniques… So why Kurosaki, are you afraid Im not… Its just… Thinking calmly… In my current state… I dont think I can win… Ichigo… Wh-Whats that sound! Ganju Ah, its been a while since I last appeared! Thank you very much! Huh Wheres Shiba Umm… He was around there earlier… Oh, I see! Hes probably gone to the bathroom We cant be sure of that… No…Its the bathroom, the bathroom! Why are you limiting it to the bathroom Youve made such a mess here… Please fix it later! Dont worry about small details Whyd you come here You even came on a boar Where in the world did you find one! Well, there sure are unusual animals here! You got it from the zoo! Well, hes nothing like my Bonnie… BOAR Oh, come to think of it, Kuchiki, you dont know my cute Bonnie, do you So whyd you come here Oh, thats right… Well, I sensed a gloomy Spiritual Pressure coming from somewhere in the town… Im the type to be bothered by things like that So I followed the scent and here I am! So its you! Youre the gloomy bastard! What did you say! Its true! I didnt notice Now that you mention it, this is pretty bad… Everyone, open the windows, the windows! Dont talk as if Im garbage! Youre the same as rotten garbage! Im going to freshen you a bit! Hey, old man, do you know a good place Old man! I may look like this, but Im quite friendly with your older sister, you know… Well, if thats the case… Come this way, underground! Yeah, Im thankful for this Lets go, Ichigo! All right! Ichigo, get out of your gigai! This isnt a gigai… –This is… –This is fine, isnt it! What are you… Huh! Ill come join you as well! Thanks! Lets go, Ichigo! Hey! Nows not the time… W-Wait a second! Hey! Hey! Prepare yourself! Can we still use it I dont know… If we fix it, perhaps… There should be tools somewhere around here Ill search for them… No Thats all right Come on, come on, spin! Stop it, Jinta… Shut up! Hell dry well if I do this! Hey! Dont dry me out with clothes pins! Especially in the middle of the night! Keep it quiet! Its bad for the injured inside! A-All right… I told you! Shut up! Does it hurt No… Its not that bad thanks to the healing… I do feel bad for getting you involved in all of this when you don’t have anything to do with it… I am involved Theyre targeting me Even without my powers, Im a Quincy Jin…Kariya told me earlier… “Im sorry for getting you involved” But…thats not what he really felt… Yes Probably not… Thats what shocked me the most… No one knows what hes really like… Hes trying to go to Hueco Mundo isnt he But I dont know what he plans to do when he gets there… But I dont think the cause is worth going as far as to break our tribes laws and sacrificing humans Of course… I…also attacked living humans… Im despicable But that’s… We Bounts, since long ago… since we were born in this world… No, since we appeared… Our numbers have been decided Huh During a certain time, Bounts appeared among normal people A sudden mutation… We havent appeared since then… And…new life cannot be born from Bounts Never We are a race that just dies… Slowly, over many months and years Thats why Im telling you youre scared! How sloppy! Ill straighten out your cowardliness! Bring it on! It seems you finally feel like doing this! You, go! Huh Why me Are you afraid, too What did you say! Then go! Finish quickly, like the “Renji” you are Oh well! Hey! What about you Here I go, Ichigo! Take this! Come on, come on, come on! Come on, come on! My, my, how pathetic With the state you’re in right now, even I can easily take you on! What did you say! Come down here, Ganju! Don’t get distracted! Here I go, Ichigo! Seppa, turn to sand! Huh! Senpen banka! Take this! This is bad! It got me, too! Why you… The Chili Pepper Smoke Bomb is irritating my eyes! Try and kiss my butt! You bastard! Come down here! Stupid!

You invite me here and leave by yourself Well, I was told to come back quickly so, Im going Take care! What a way to run away… Well… I guess it doesnt matter! Its as he said! What is this pathetic state Youre full of openings! Shut up! Are you afraid of Kariya! Im not afraid! When did you become such a wimp! I didnt! Roar! Zabimaru! Wait just a second! Why is it so crowded! Oh… Would you like me to warm up your packed lunch –Yes –Hey… Arent there any other employees Umm…well… Manager, take care of the register! Huh Shibas still in the bathroom, huh He sure takes a long time… Im going to check on him… Manager, could you take care of the register instead –Hey! –Hurry up! Yes! Shiba! Sorry to keep you waiting! I feel refreshed Im going to the register! See He was in the bathroom! URAHARAS SHOP Can I ask you something Do you have any pride as a Bount Huh I have it… Pride as a Quincy… The Quincies are a tribe which was given a power by God to protect people from Hollows Even if Im the only one, I will fulfill my heavenly duty with pride as a Quincy… Pride, huh What a nice sound… When did you start to calculate your chances of winning or losing!

" Woke up with yawning, its dawning Im still alive Turned on my radio To start up new day As goddamned DJ chattered How to survive Amazing news got over On that air wave Tonight, Love is rationed Tonight, Across the nation Tonight Love reflects world wide Almost another day Shes a shooting star Good-night, good-night Shes a shooting star Good-bye… Tonight, Love is rationed Tonight, Across the nation Tonight Love reflects world wide Almost another day See you some other day I wonder how long Kurosaki and Renji are going to train Who knows Well, we should let them run amuck until theyre satisfied Honestly That fool is depressed just because he lost once… Yeah…youre right… Whats with that! Will fighting make him feel better Idiots sure are simple! Come to think of it, what happened between Ishida and Yoshino Ishida was really worried about Yoshino… Who knows The Bounts are our enemy! What good would it do to worry about an enemy! Yeah… Anyway, we’ve a lot of questions to ask that woman once she recovers a bit more… Im exhausted… We got carried away and now its morning… Everyone, breakfast has been prepared! I even prepared some for the freeloader! That always bothers me… Wheres Urahara The store owner is in the back repairing Lirin and the others’ gigai Want some coffee Yeah Coffee Thanks… Here you go Thats gross! What are you doing! What is this disgusting drink! Its coffee… Dont you know what it is No I dont! Renji, cant you drink coffee What a kid What did you say! Do you want some sugar in it Huh Sugar You put in sugar to drink it What a strange tea… Just a little more… One more… Thats too much! How much of a sweet tooth do you have! Whats this It sure is noisy this morning… Good morning! Hey! Morning! Hm What is it It seems youve gotten over it… It was quite a pain… This guy was completely depressed… Shut up! I wasnt that depressed! Oh Whats with that look! Well, fine… Lets start from the beginning Yeah! Wow… That looks delicious! You have a good eye! I used french toast as a base and spread melted bean jam on it in place of honey Its bean jam toast! Youre still making things like that… Let’s eat! Rukia, do you know –how to drink this coffee thing –Its delicious! What are you talking about! Ive already cleared that drink! Ooh Thats amazing! Are you surprised! A brief rest between battles… A happy circle of friends What a great thing! Whats wrong, Noba Are you worried about something The Bount… Oh, Yoshinos presence Well, yes It seems she left the premises a bit earlier, but were all adults who can take responsibility for our own actions Its not something we should be making a fuss about each time! Besides, disturbing this happy morning circle with troubling information is stressful… We can tell them later when things have calmed down Yeah Master Kariya, I had everyone besides us head to that location, as you commanded I see… Fixing a broken clock will once again start the motion of time… For Bounts, time was stopped from the very beginning… Even if our gears are fixed, and wound up, it will never move… Humans live with time They reject us Bounts… We just exist Thats it… The Bounts have time that doesnt flow, and are despised by humans… But… We will try to move that motionless time We will change fate ourselves… in order to do that URAHARAS SHOP Where are you going Are your wounds okay You had pretty serious injuries, didnt you Well, its none of my concern… Huh! W-Wait a second! What are you doing! Dont touch a lady so familiarly! Where are we going! Can you track Yoshinos Spiritual Pressure Yoshino Is Yoshino that old Bount lady Come to think of it, her presence wasnt in the house… Tell me where Yoshino is! All right… To tell you the truth, one disappeared this morning… What did Well… Oh Another one No Two What disappeared! Hmm…well… Their presence disappeared… –Presence –Yes! Thats right! A presence Pre-sence! Hm Whats this fuss about Come to think of it, Lirin sure is late… I wonder if shes still sleeping –As I was saying… –What is it I want to join in! Youve come… Are you serious What are you talking about Do you really plan to do this Well…who knows Im going to put an end to this! Oh Which way! Hey, Im getting dizzy! Dont swing me around like that! This way Or is it this way Hurry! Stop it! Im getting dizzy and getting even more confused! You said that it still wasnt time yet… The situation has changed What in the world changed Are you curious Its up to you… I need your help… Stop it! Are you serious But I wont let you! Zeig dih, Goethe! What do you want, Yoshino Youre my alter ego, arent you What is this all about Do you have any problems with dying here Were going to die together All right… Back here again What was that sound It seems that Bounts are fighting! Thats dangerous! Are you running away Goethe, calm down! Yoshino… Wait! If you go, youll just be in the way! So thats whats going on In other words, Yoshino, Ishida, and Lirin, have left… What did you say! Tell us that sooner! Ive tried many times! Stop! Nows not the time to be quarreling! Damn! At any rate, lets go after Ishida and the others! Noba, do you know where theyre heading Yes, I do All right! Lets hurry! Everyone! What is it, Urahara –Don’t tell me youre trying to stop… –No… But this is a race against time… Kurosaki and Abarai, run ahead of us with Flash Step We will catch up with you –All right! –Also… Our goal is to get Ishida back, we should avoid a fight if possible! Yoshino! Im all right… Goethe, fight as you please without concern for me! Why are you rushing to your death Jin… Yoshino! Its amazing that you can use a doll in your condition… We control this worlds great power with these crests But if our balance is lost, our power goes out of control and attacks us Theres no way that you can summon a doll or even freely control one in your decrepit state… I dont care what happens to me if I can stop you! Thats wrong… You really dont know your own worth Huh Your doll, Goethe, doesnt have subservient feelings towards you… He has feelings of love… That is because even though we cannot leave descendants, youre the only Bount who has a maternal power… What What do you mean! Quincy boy, I know youre here… How about coming out Y-You! Why did you come He couldnt just let a pitiful woman die alone… Am I wrong What do you plan to do with me… a Quincy A Quincy without his powers… is useless! I no longer have a use for you! But since you’re here… Ill show you something interesting… –What do you plan to do! –Yoshino! Yoshino… I cant move… Goethe… Over there! Ishida! This is as far as youll go! You! You wont pass here An important ritual is about to begin… Ritual We wont let things go the way you want them to! Roar! Zabimaru! Guard, Dalk! Fine… This is boring, but Ill play with you What is this ritual! You dont need to know! What do you plan to do with her! Yoshino has a maternal power… Maternal From past experience, I learned that my targeted power cannot be achieved by just sucking the souls of living humans… And when I researched the best way to absorb souls, I arrived at this womans power! Be glad! Youre going to become a mother! Thats right Youll breathe life into new dolls! Stop! Yoshino! Goethe… Yoshino… Goethe… You still want to fight How admirable… Ishida! What the--! Dont take your eyes off me! The crest is… Etched in his body… Jin has… Fused his own body with his doll… Well, thats right… Yes… You were always strong… And will continue to be strong… I was only used… Just a foolish woman… But… Goethe! Yoshino… I’m sorry… What do you plan to do Do it! All right… Come, Goethe… Yoshi…no… Were together until the end… Mama… Yoshino… Oh So you fused with your doll, as I thought you would… Lets go…Goethe! She lost her crest But shes not absorbed by the doll… So this is Yoshinos maternal spiritual power… What Theyre floating in mid-air! I wont let you interfere! Damn! What in the world is going on! Im your opponent! This power is what I wanted! But…it would be bad if I let it wither away here Jin! Stop! Yoshino! Dont die! You cant die! I wonder if I can die now What are you talking about! Th-That’s… This is fine This way of dying is fine… No! What direct eyes… Thank you, proud, last Quincy… I was waiting for this moment… Zeigt euch, neue leben Yoshino… your life shall be newly reborn! What! Hey! Come back here! Ichigo! Whats that! Wonderful! Its as we planned! The birth of a new doll! Thats right! More! More must be born! Wh-What was that! Hey! Sky blue dreams shine and flicker, dancing away into the sky The flowers glow and fade away The sky falls silent, as a pair of dreamy fireworks (Hanabi) lit up I will sing my piercing love to you Can you hear my voice Blooming in an instant are fireworks (Hanabi) Sky blue dreams shine and flicker, dancing away into the sky Blossom away in full bloom, high above Protect and keep those feelings thriving Strongly, at least till the very end These flowers will glow and fade away What were those bird-like things One of Lirins friends How insulting! Im the blue bird of luck! Thats what you think of yourself as Arent you more like a cursed doll What did you say! How insulting! Ill put a curse on you! The Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers Golden after these messages! – Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! – Golden! Captain Kyoraku! Dont come! Old Gramps Yama took his time to summon me… This cant be anything ordinary… Old gramps Yama… This is… What is it!

Jeez… What a troublesome thing to be pushed on me… URAHARAS SHOP Wheres Ishida Hes in the back room… but he wishes to be left alone for now I see… What about the presence of the Bounts that disappeared Nothing at all… Yes, well, we dont know why, but our sensors are entirely ineffective… In short… We detect nothing Yes Those strange things that came out back then… What were they… It seems that Bounts gather ki, or spiritual power existing in the natural world, and by controlling it, they create dolls By that definition, the strange things that Kurosaki saw were probably dolls And it was necessary to create countless dolls… Even if it meant ending the life of one of their own kind… This has become troublesome… Lets gather information and start over First, Abarai… Huh Can you come with me to investigate Kariyas mansion Okay… Inoue and Sado, go to school from here for a while Why As long as our enemys Spiritual Pressure cannot be traced, were placing ourselves at great risk You both live alone School is fine, but it would be safer to come here where theres a barrier Okay All right Kurosaki, return to your house Isnt your family worried You havent been home in a while Also, I want you to think of a plan for when the Bounts make their move… A plan Take Lirin and the others to your house and keep your eyes peeled for their movements Well be of tremendous help to you!

Thats not… Shes completely misunderstood the situation… Well shes got good reason to be worried… It cant be helped An adult talking to this many dolls… Seriously, what can she say Whos fault is that Ichigo! Couldn’t ask for better timing Ill become stupid if I hang around here any longer! Im going to go out for a change of atmosphere! Ah! Wait! Dont leave me! – Now then, were going to do our own work! – Thats so horrible! – Well, were of no help against a Hollow – Dont leave me! Ichigo! Sister! Why are you leaving me behind--! Youre so horrible…so horrible… How long are you going to keep crying! What are you doing! Do you understand the current situation Whats with this all of a sudden The Bounts are targeting strong spiritual power What about it Do we have to tell you everything Ichigos family has strong spiritual power So weve got to set up a plan to protect them! A-All right Youve sure gotten used to this… I guess so… All right, lets go back! Hey! Whats wrong Dont you think somethings strange What is How should I put it… a strange presence is coming from your house… A Bount No… I dont think so… All right, Im finished! What are you doing! Thats my line! What kind of stupid thing are you doing Ill explain! Huh This is an anti-Bount trap An anti-Bount trap Thats right! Its so well be all right no matter when the enemy attacks! Weve borrowed useful tools from Urahara to create a powerful trap! Take a look at it now! Here! This is a tool that uses bait to lure those creatures in and trap them If we pull this… the basket drops! There We can trap the enemy like this! Furthermore, in order to keep the enemy from escaping… This basket is made out of a special bamboo that seals away spiritual power! I see Dont be impressed--! And also… How about this! What kind of charm is this Its a Bount repellent! The balloons at the ends gather minute spiritual power in the air and… use CD shaped reflective panels to release a light that Bounts hate! Theyre not birds… We have a ground type Bount repellent with the same effect I placed them! I call them Kons Special Bount Repellent! These are for cats… We even prepared indoor traps, in case a Bount enters the house! Look, if an enemy comes over this mark, hell trigger the sensor… and the mortar hanging on the ceiling will come falling! Yes, this mortar is made of Sekkiseki which seals away spiritual power! Afterwards, we can gang up on our immobilized enemy! Kon, is there anything special about that trap you were making earlier Yes! There is a special medicine on the ropes It can seal away the spiritual power of whoevers feet touches it! Did Urahara make all of these Thats right! We have ensured your safety for the time being! Who would fall for these traps Oh no! Whats that! Why its Hanataro! Oh, Rukia! Wow! Its a big success! Its a calculated artistic dual trap that makes whoever trips fall face first into a pie! What are you doing I was on my way to make a delivery… Oh! The convenience store I work at has a delivery service! And thats when you got caught by the Bount repellent trap Bount Isnt that why you were dispatched to the World of the Living Since I came to the World of the Living… Ive been so wrapped up in everyday life that I dont know what Im doing… Come to think of it… why did I come to the World of the Living Jeez Pull yourself together… Weve proven the usefulness of our traps! I got it, now clean this up already! What did you say! Thats right! I said earlier, these are anti-Bount traps…! Youve had enough fun… Leave it at that… Hanataro, wash your face here Thank you very much! He really fell for it… Oh! Sister, wait for me--! Whats with that attitude! Everyone is underestimating the Bounts! It seems we have to hit them with fear! Unforgivable… Just you wait! Yeah Special suits that Kisuke made for us to amplify our powers! I never thought I would be using them here… They look like the Bount minions that we saw earlier How convenient Were going to show Ichigo and the others! Were going to go out like this, and Ichigo and the others are going to think that Bounts have come… and will attack us! Ill amplify my illusion power with the suit and dodge the attack! I see Then Ill link my transformation energy… with the suits power, and then display my power! When Ichigo begins to panic, Noba, who will be hiding, will control the traps Well fall into the traps on purpose… and run away Well prove that these traps are useful! Well risk our lives to show them how useful our anti-Bount plan is! Thyere coming All right, lets begin our plan! Lets give it… our best! Noba, activate the traps well! Sorry for borrowing all these things from you… Dont worry about it I-Ichigo! What is it Youre being noisy! Th-That! What! Hado 33! Sotatsui! Did I do it! You over did it! That surprised me… Thank you, Noba… We were saved thanks to your power… Noba Cant you hear us Whats that Look out! Noba, run away! Hado 31! Shakkaho! Sorry! Noba, are you all right! Im all right… Why isnt Rukia surprised! If I am to assume, Rukia works as a Soul Reaper Shes used to life-threatening situations Thats why she can do things like that instantly… Lets stop already! This is dangerous! Oh! Ichigo! Oh, theres a reason for this look… Aah! Lirin and Kurodo are being eaten! What What! Rukia! Hado 4! Byakurai! Where did they go! Kon! What is it Go in my body – Aah, that surprised me… – Rukia! Where did the Bounts go I lost sight of them…but… They shouldnt be too far away! All right Im all ready to do this! KUROSAKI CLINIC I just contacted Renji Excuse me… I understand that you feel guilty for letting your friends get eaten No… Noba, take care of things here! Let us know if something happens! Oh! Wait, Ichigo! Lirin, Kurodo…we’ve only known each other for a short time but… As a fellow mod soul, I will avenge them! Kon! A-Are you all right Sorry… I’ll leave the rest to you… Did you find them No…theyre not here… Ill go over there All right Are they gone Gone Really, what barbaric people! Our plan is wasted! At any rate, we have to clear up this misunderstanding! Agreed First, lets take off these suits Youre right Why! I cant take off this suit! Has it malfunctioned! Huh Why can I hear your voice The external speakers are broken, but it seems the suit-to-suit radio is all right I see! Noba also has a receiver for this radio Well be saved if we go back to where Noba is! However, there wont be a problem if Noba tells them about us, would there But looking at Rukias attitude earlier, it doesnt seem like hes explained yet… At any rate, lets hurry back! I agree Someones coming! Oh, yes! Curse Big Sis… Shes really a slave driver! Return your own CDs… Is he gone Did he notice us! Hey! Afro Man! What are you playing today Shut up! Im not playing! Whats with that You could talk to me a little… Dont talk to me! How come so many people in this town can see me! Whats that It seems to be the Soul Reaper in charge of this town… Huh Then what are Rukia and the others Well, I dont think that Rukia, Abarai, and Kurosaki are doing usual work… In that sense, doesnt he fill that purpose! Dont move, you dolls! Oh no! Lets run away! Hado 33! Sotatsui! Wh-Whats this! Youre not getting away! Oh! Why, if it isnt Lady Kuchiki! Meeting you here is… Shakkaho!! That was close! What! Stop… Kuchiki is playing war! I never knew she was interested in that… Could it be that Ive been left out yet again! I cant take it anymore--! – Now hurry! Were almost there! – Im finally finished… Hanataro! Save me…! Kurodo, I thought of a good plan to get away from here! Were on the same wavelength… Me too! Wh-What! Could this be… All right, prepare yourself! Youre now our hostage… Wait just a moment! This is bad! Roar! Zabimaru! Renji, you came! You bet! Dont let your guard down! They may be small, but theyre with the Bounts! It seems that whatever we say is useless… S-So it seems It cant be helped Lets do that! What! That! Lets go! Yes! Energy release! Combine! Go--! – Konpakumajin! – Konpakumajin! Whats this--! What a dopey look! Here I go! Roar! Huh! Wh-Whats this! Renji, look! When did he get my Zabimaru! – Roar! Zabimaru! – Roar! Zabimaru! Save me, Big Brother! Crap… Whats going on! Fool! Whats this Stop it That tickles! Stop it! Rukia! Now to finish you off! Ichigo! Renji! This is strange! – Theres no way to escape… – Its too late! Even if you realize that its an illusion! What a mistake for some one like me to make--! Bastard… Using illusions--! Prepare yourself! Whats this Noba! Lirin! Kurodo! Whats the meaning of this Well, these are… These are suits that the perverted storeowner made Noba said that it strengthens the wearers fighting power in stuffed animal form! What you saw earlier were variations of Lirins power to show illusions… And Kurodos power to transform! What! URAHARAS SHOP Well, Im sorry… Lets not use this suit anymore It wouldnt be good if they were mistaken for enemies… Really! Who knows what would have happened if I wasnt around! Noba wouldnt have talked by himself! You might be in your grave right now… Huh Whats the matter, Lirin Whats with that look You should be more grateful! After all, Im the one who saved your--! Youre too pushy! Youre a man arent you! What did you say! – Shut up! – Im going to beat you up! Lets put away the Bount repellent traps as well Theyre useful, but a bit problematic… Youre right… Hey, did someone clean up the ones planted at home No, no, no KUROSAKI  CLINIC Im home, Yuzu… Whats this A new game Sky blue dreams shine and flicker, dancing away into the sky The flowers glow and fade away The sky falls silent, as a pair of dreamy fireworks (Hanabi) lit up I will sing my piercing love to you Can you hear my voice Blooming in an instant are fireworks (Hanabi) Sky blue dreams shine and flicker, dancing away into the sky Blossom away in full bloom, high above Protect and keep those feelings thriving Strongly, at least till the very end These flowers will glow and fade away Ichigo!

Its serious! What in the world are they planning… Ichigo Stop repeating the same thing to yourself… I’m getting so irritated! I saw it on the news this morning… People from all over have gone missing… That means… Those monsters they let loose might be attacking people… Dammit! As usual, Lirin and the others sensors didn’t catch anything either… Where are those Bounts hiding… Renji Huh Has any information come from Soul Society The Stealth Force seems to be here, but I havent received any information… At any rate, we cant do anything until we find the Bounts and those creatures… Is there a way Right now, Urahara is making a powerful sensor at my request Until its finished, were just going to have to take our chances at coming across them in the streets Will Ishida be all right… He seemed really shocked about Yoshino… He stayed silent even when I talked to him… Im a bit worried… Theres nothing we can do… Hes fallen in love with that Bount woman, huh Gosh… Dont make fun of him…! Thats not very considerate… Huh Youre one to talk about being considerate! What did you say! Stop it! Really Why are you two always like this… Nows not the time to be quarreling among friends! Gentlemen… Several hundreds of years ago, we lost many friends in this underground capital I am especially moved that we will begin our final plan here Though it is an ambitious plan, the spite of our fallen allies will give us unlimited power It seems that Soul Society has made their move, but theres no need to worry The mineral here eliminates all Spiritual Pressure Furthermore… Our newly born dolls also contain large amounts of that mineral as well Lets take the time to refresh ourselves! Now then, gentlemen, there are a few who dont know the results of my research I shall show you Bitto They suck out the souls of living humans and bring them here This is a doll that was created from Ugaki and my technology Ooh… Thats what you were doing Well, we ended up trading the life of one of our friends, though… But how is that different from us directly sucking peoples souls It cant just be that theres no danger… The souls that Bitto bring are of high purity In other words theyre concentrated… We shall begin sucking souls, a practice that was considered taboo by our tribe That energy will be gradually stored up in our bodies With this, our abilities should leap to more than ten times our current level What What did you say! More than ten times… Is that true Of course This is the truth With this power, we will fulfill our long-cherished wish Ill go first Burn this into your mind! The moment that our tribes laws and history change! I have no feelings of pain or regret… All I feel is joy and power! Wonderful! I see… The collected souls are concentrated within the Bittos body I never thought it would produce this much power… Thats not too bad… Ill pass… Are you serious! Mabashi…! You’re not planning to do that as well Are you So you’ve chickened out You baby! Thats not it! Im asking what you think about breaking our tribes laws! Say, Sawatari… What is it, Mabashi I know Long ago, you sucked many living souls…! That was quite long ago… The side effects! Thats why youve aged so much! Thats why it was a taboo! How annoying! It doesnt matter if it means we gain power! Its not as if were going to die! What did you say…! Calm down, everyone Lets not say things thatll ruin Kariyas historical moment Please allow me to— Shut up! The laws are one thing, but things like this are… Stop, Mabashi! There are always controversies in the world Theres nothing wrong with asserting your opinions It doesnt matter… S-Stop… Mabashi, the next time you accuse me of something, you do it at the risk of your life! Then you can say whatever you want! Didnt I tell you before Right now, I am the law of the Bount tribe! The Stealth Force…was defeated They couldnt have… Not all of them, but a few have… It seems that their stomachs were pierced by those monsters Furthermore, the monsters that the Bounts released removed living human souls and escaped… How cruel… The way they do things isnt beautiful… Captain Hitsugaya, what are they planning to do Gathering information is the job of the Stealth Force Were going to the World of the Living Yeah… You four will go I have already spoken to the Captains committee Why us A monster has appeared Thats our specialty Even if it isnt a Hollow… Then our targets are those monsters No Were targeting the Bounts Excuse me… What is it Thats pretty messy work, isnt it… Unlike the other lieutenants, I dont like ugly things Why was I chosen When I asked Zaraki, he said you had the most free time… N-No way! What about it N-Nothing Is that so… I have the feeling that theyre planning something even worse We cant leave it to just Ichigo Kurosaki and Abarai Im counting on you! Yes! URAHARAS SHOP Its not bad for last minute preparations… Its wonderful, store owner! Now then… Im very sorry for interrupting you Not at all So what did she say This is a message from Madam Yoruichi “I will be investigating in Soul Society for a while Be careful of the Bounts movements” I see… So how are things on the other side Various posts are gathering information on the Bounts But they’re still uncertain All right Thank you for your help I will excuse myself now… I have to return to Madam Yoruichi immediately… But… What is it I cant believe that Madam Yoruichi lived in a rundown shack like this… What did you say Calm down… Im sorry… But its pretty comfortable here… Keep in mind that if something happens to Madam Yoruichi, you wont get away easily! My, my… Id like to avoid being chased by the Punishment Force… Hey! Ururu! Jinta! Sorry its late, but… Could you go out for me for a bit Okay…! But to call this place a rundown shack… Excuse me… You should go in your room It would be bad if you were targeted… Thank you… Umm, are you all right You look pale… Im all right… Urahara is calling you… Y-Yes… I’m counting on all of you tonight as well Lets all split up and be on the look out! Someone who is fighting a monster should exhibit elevated Spiritual Pressure… All right… Will they really come out Nothing will happen if they dont Its pretty tricky now… Say, why are you two like that Protecting Orihime is the duty of the Hikoboshi, who would be me, Kurodo! I wouldnt be of any help in a fight as a stuffed animal… Its dangerous for her to go by herself… Thats not fair! Then Ill go into a gigai as well… Lirin, thats enough! Were going! Ooh… What is this… Its amazing…! How is it, gentlemen Its better than I imagined, Kariya! This isnt bad I feel as if Ive become younger by a hundred years, easily… What a feeling! Even though this is a doll I created, this is definitely a great achievement that marks the coming of a new age for Bounts! This is still just the beginning If we continue to absorb this, an even more wonderful world will open itself for us This is addictive! I think I shall have some more… Well, this was worth taking the effort to research…! Mabashi! Whats wrong Theres nothing to be afraid of I dont want to do this! Master Kariya, will you allow me to treat his wounds Theres no need for that Huh… Hell be cured… in an instant… S-Stop! Let go! I… Bitto! S-Stop… I told you theres nothing to be afraid of… Welcome, Mabashi, to the new world Lirin, any sign of them Nothing at all… I wonder whats going on… Cant Urahara finish that sensor already… I give up… Ive always been curious about it, but… Huh What kinds of things do Sado and Noba talk about when theyre alone together Who knows… Its probably, “What should we have for dinner” or “The weather is nice today” Oh yeah, maybe something like, “Its delicious if you top your ramen with chocolate” That would be you… Really I cant imagine them having a conversation… Do they even talk CONVERSATION FAILED Ichigo that bastard… Where in the world did he go…! The same with Sister! How could they leave me behind… “Guh” You bastard! What do you think youre doing! Why, if it isnt the mysterious critter from Ichigos place… Mysterious critter Dont underestimate me! What are you doing here I was just taking a walk! A walk Thats right! I just wanted to get a bit of the night air! You were left behind, felt lonely, and chased after Ichigo, didnt you! H-How could you say that! I was worried about Sister… I was so worried… So I wanted to help her a little… H-Hey! Im not finished talk…ing… Roar! Zabimaru! Someone’s Spiritual Pressure just increased! Its Renji! It seems hes fighting…! Renji… Lets go! Where are you going Revenge…for her Thats not it… You need to recover your Quincy powers in order to do that… Thats a thorny path The Bounts said earlier that they needed a Quincys power And afterwards, they said that they had no need for a Quincy… Didnt they Which do you think is true Which do you think Who knows… Did you ever think about what would happen if you were able to recover your power If I wasnt there, she might not have died… Was that the case I have to find the truth With your pride as a Quincy at stake Yes… Thats the kind of tribe we are… Hes young But thats not bad at all… You kid! Youre all right now! Stay still! Damn! These guys really are targeting the souls of living humans…! Ill slice down every one of you! Master Kariya… What is it… A Soul Reaper is destroying the Bitto How impertinent… He’ll soon learn what happens when you damage a Bitto Hey, you dont look like you have any wounds… You cant even hear me, huh Wh-What is this What is this! Dont leave my side! Bring it on! 100 or 200… Ill crush you all!

Ow… Come to think of it, I cant sense the Good-For-Nothings Spiritual Pressure anymore Did he die You shouldnt say that… Lets take a look! Hes probably that way! Jinta, are you actually worried about him Ow…! Dont be silly! Who would worry about such a big eater! Your face is red despite saying that Shut up! I just want to see him looking stupid!

Im Go Koga, What in the world did you do to Keigo I dont plan on talking… Sorry, but Im going to crush you! Zeig Dih, Dalk! Hello! How are you! Wonderful! This feeling is enchanting! Did she always look like that Somethings a little different about her… My bodys tingling… Im flushed! Look at me! Youre my type… I want to chase you rather than be chased… Ichigo! Its heavy! Sh-Shes… Oh my Are your hands numb It seems that Ive changed… This body… Ill let you have a good taste of it Ichigo! Oh my That bandana matched you Im sorry! Shes faster than before… Not only that, but shes become heavier and tougher… Are you finished testing him, Dalk Yes… Youre pretty good! But I dont have the time to be fighting with you! Ive got to save Keigo! Oh, how wonderful! How manly! I cant feel his Spiritual Pressure anymore! Whats going on Hes either fainted or lost his fighting spirit… Or… Or Hey! Inoue! Kuchiki! Wheres Renji I dont know… He should be around here… We suddenly couldnt sense his Spiritual Pressure, but… Could it be that Renji is… Wheres Kurosaki I had him go in the direction of the Bounts Hes using Store Owners handmade sensor… I dont know if he found them… Lirin went with him You should join Ichigo! What about you Im going to search for Renji Something out of the ordinary must have happened! All right Look out! Whats this! Aim a little better! Im terrible with details! Isnt it better to kill two or three of them at once Why not Whether you slice them or crush them, its the same thing so long as you defeat them… Youre right… Leave this to me and go! But… Ururu, go to where Sado is! Jinta, Ill leave Renji to you! Huh Me Youre his friend, after all! Were not friends! Here she comes! Scatter! Hado 33! Sokatsui!

If I may speak out, make that three You two… Youre going to tell us where Kariya is! And what you plan to do! I wonder about that… This feels good! Sorry Did I hit you Crap! You have a bad habit of toying with your prey Really Were fighting for our lives I should let him taste extreme fear and pain Its too tragic not to know when youll die You guys sure like to talk! Treating me like some minor character… How manly of you! Well then! Accept my feelings! Get out of the way! More, more! Oh Dont touch Keigo! Are you all right! Ill save you soon Dont worry! Ichigo… You… He can see Soul Reapers, huh That means that quite a bit of his soul has been sucked out… He cant be saved Im going to take Keigo with me! Its pointless Even if you returned his soul to him, his body wouldnt be able to take the load What do you plan to accomplish by collecting souls with those strange bugs You see it now, dont you This is the power that I received from the souls that the Bitto concentrated… We plan to absorb more of this And attain the ultimate power to achieve our goal Ichigo… Run…away… Keigo! Oh my I guess he didnt have enough Getsugatensho! Keigo…I’ll…get you right away… Thats pretty good… But not good enough That was a good attack… But it wont work against us Im enjoying this This is fun! She said to join Kurosaki He went to where the Bounts are All right All right You children… Run away quickly! They wont fall for my hallucinations forever! Whats wrong I have to save Keigo No! His soul was already sucked out! We cant save him even if we go… I cant save anyone if I cant save Keigo right now Not even myself! Thats right There is no one who can save another… Thats either arrogance or an illusion What! I wont forgive you if you run away before Im finished… Ichigo! Im not letting you get away anymore! Youre not getting away… What! You fell for it! Take this, and this! Oh my… is that it Good bye What! Whats this! Dont refer to someone as “this,” you idiot! Who are you Who am I Dont ask me stupid things! Im me! I thought you were just a regular Soul Reaper, but… Ichigos the one whos regular! Im not soft like he is! Id like to say that this doesnt involve me, but it would be a problem if Im crushed Im going to crush you! Oh my Does that mean that you fight a little better Want to test me Of course! Too slow! Dont treat me like Ichigo! He doesnt even compare to me! No… Y-You…! Again! Youre going to interfere with me again! Youre weak! If you chase me out right now, youll die! Dont you understand Ichigo… You need strong feelings in order to use strong power What…did you say You dont have enough of that Thats why you cannot control your power Shut up! Unfortunately, you gained power imperfectly Because of that, you will destroy yourself in the near future… Before that happens… Zeig Dih, Dalk!

Rukia! Keep it up! Hado 33! Sotatsui! Anyway, we need defense! Oh! Sorry! E-Everyone, are you all right We were able to defend ourselves this time, but we wont be able to keep taking hits Ritze! Draw out more of Rukias power! Understood! Huh Why! Nice--! Look out! Ritze is drawing out Rukias power to the limit She plans on using it until her body falls apart! At this rate, Rukias body is in danger! Santenkesshun! No--! Dont! Please! Stop! Kuchiki… Open your eyes… Orihime! Orihime! Santenkesshun! I reject! Kuchiki! You fool! Dont waste time! Slice your opponent with the Kotenzanshun! But… We are the embodiment of your will! We cant do anything unless you make the decision! Aagh… Shes coming again! No! I cant! I cant do it! What are you talking about, fool! Ow--! Shut up! Do you want to die! Are you all right Yes… But… How does it feel, knowing that you have to hurt your friend to survive! Ow--! No ows, you idiot! How long are you going to fight defensively! Huh! But… But, were talking about Kuchiki! I cant fight Kuchiki! Hado 33! Sotatsui!! Lets take turns Ill carry him Thank you, but… Hes my friend He has nothing to do with this… But this still happened to him It seems that the Bounts are attacking living humans at random You dont need to feel responsible I do! Were friends I cant let Keigo die! Never! Sorry… Im not your enemy Right now, our enemy are the Bounts Theres no point in us arguing We were not exactly friends, but… Ive…also lost an important person So its not as if I dont understand your feelings Besides that, Im not as weak as I look Lets go… If you want to save your friend, it doesnt matter whos carrying him Youre right Orihime, are you all right! I-Im all right… I cant get enough! I cant get enough of this! This is a bad wound! At this rate… Im all right… How is everyone Were not all right! My wound wont stop bleeding This is horrible! Use your Kotenzanshun! Use it while I still have power! I went to save her… Kuchiki… In Soul Society… Kurosaki, Ishida, and Sado as well And the Soul Reapers…everyone… We tried to save Kuchiki We were injured…very injured… but we didnt give up I couldnt do anything, but… Even so, I wanted to save Kuchiki So why, oh, why did this happen Sorry for repeating the same thing over and over… But…Kuchiki is my friend I want to eat lunch together… And study together… So…I… I cant use my Kotenzanshun on her Then lets do this What I have a plan URAHARAS SHOP Urahara! This is… Store Owner! Who are you-- Third Squad Lieutenant, Izuru Kira Urahara… Please… Save Keigo At any rate, come in How is he This is dangerous… His souls power is quite weak I know! We might be able to save him if we directly inject Ichigos spiritual power into him! Tessai! Do you have a reishi injection tool Of course! What number Number one…number three… And as a backup, number six! Understood! I shall bring them immediately! Come to think of it, wheres Abarai Hes in the next room receiving treatment Abarai is tough and hell probably recover quickly, but the child that he saved… Number one, number three and number six are prepared! Thank you very much! Ill begin working on joining them! I have a plan If attacking Rukia is not an option… How about directly attacking the Bount controlling the doll controlling Rukia Thats right! Lets do that! A nice plan of mine Thats no good! Bounts are human! I cant attack humans You cant be worried about that! If we dont defeat this Bount here, well be killed along with Rukia And the whole world will be thrown into chaos! But… It doesnt have to be fatal! We can just deal enough damage to make him unable to use his doll, catch him, and heal his wounds afterwards! Are you finished with your strategy meeting So what are you going to do Orihime! Tsubaki! You finally feel like doing it, huh! Deal with them, Rukia! Quickly! What are you doing! Quickly! Yes! Tsubaki! Kotenzanshun! I reject! Fools! Why do you think that Im defenseless!

Thirteen Court Guards, Ninth Squad Lieutenant, Shuhei Hisagi A Soul Reaper, huh! So what about it! Ive come to destroy the Bounts Oh, is that so Then try it! If you can! Go! Rukia!

If the host dies, there are many other humans I can attach my doll to! Thats it! Ill put her in your body next! Go, Rukia! What are you doing! Go quickly! Ino…ue… Kuchiki Youre fighting Ritze! Hold on! Why are you resisting! Why you… Theres no way she can do that! Kuchiki… Inoue…do it! Fire…at me! Inoue… No way What are you talking about Kuchiki I…cant do that Please…fire… at me! Well said, Rukia Kuchiki I cant! Its painful for her to be controlled by that guy and to hurt her friends To let her die while still holding on to her pride as a Soul Reaper, is the greatest show of sympathy towards her Kuchiki also wishes for it No way… Fire at me… Kuchiki! Stop! Kuchiki Jeez! Its all right now! Ive regained control! Giving me unnecessary trouble! Kuchiki… Ill put you to rest right now Orihime! Orihime! I can go at any time!

This trip to the World of the Living is an order from my captain! Doesnt that make me the leader Im going to complain about them to the Captain when I get back! Isnt… Thats… It sure is nice…to be young I think Ill take my time and have a taste for the first time in a while Why do you suck the souls of living people Who knows Stop attacking people! I…want more power What do you plan to do when you gain power What Ill do… I cant tell you… Hey there! Its been a while! How have you been, Chad Rangiku… Why are you here Well… Im really glad I met you! Its seems that youre having a bit of trouble here My captain suddenly told me to come to the World of the Living I just arrived You know how Lieutenants like me cant come to the World of the Living too often… Its been so long, I dont know whats going on at all But the World of the Living sure is great… There are so many interesting things going on Umm… Rangiku What Oh Are those two friends of yours It seems like theyre looking at me Im Ururu Noba… Im Rangiku Matsumoto Lieutenant of Tenth Squad Pleased to meet you! Pleased to meet you A pleasure So what are you all doing here A Bount A Bount Yeah… That old man No mistake Its true, Soul Reaper Lady Really Oh, well I guess Ill show you…some proof Baura, lets go! Is that your doll Thats right What kind of joke is this His Spiritual Pressure…disappeared Noba… Do you sense anything Jump! What…was that Whale A shark It looks like a rockfish It doesnt matter what kind of fish it is! Theres no response! Behind you! Rangiku! Noba! Ow…ow…ow… Thank you! Whats with that! Im thanking you! Look this way… Hey, you! Hes bashful Youve escaped death Let me introduce him This is my doll, Baura You called me out on a nice night It feels good It talked Dolls have their own minds Humph…I see Baura can control space He can create special alternate dimensional spaces and swim freely within them It seems that boy over there has a similar ability Even so His power is outclassed Are you sure about that What an arrogant boy! Shall we show him our difference in power, Baura Were the ones who are going to show you our difference in power! Growl! Haineko! Baura! Okay, Boss Come back! Rangiku… Why That Soul Reapers judgment was correct If she didnt return that ash, Baura would have eaten it all She would have lost her Zanpakuto What! It seems his mouth is also connected to an alternate dimensional space Just when I thought I was going to get a Soul Reapers Zanpakuto Yes, Ms Rangiku Matsumoto What can I do for you Freeze the space up to 300 meters around me! And soul protection! Understood Help Kira and Shuhei in the same way! Yes! But we have a report that Lieutenant Abarai charged into battle without soul protection and was injured while protecting a human Renji! Whats wrong It seems that everyone is having a difficult time The space around here has been protected by the power of Soul Society Now we can let loose! I see… All right! Hado 4! Byakurai! Its pointless to attack him while hes in a dimensional space! He went your way! Youre being pesky! That girls pretty good! This way! He sucked in the attack Its useless from the front What should we do Noba, Ive been wondering, you know when hes going to attack He creates ripples in space, when he surfaces from the alternate dimensional space Can you predict in advance I only sense him right before he appears Which means we can only manage to just barely dodge How does he know where we are He is probably utilizing something like sonar radar Sonar radar I sense a subtle wave of spiritual pressure from within the ground Then cant we trace that to find where he is Its too weak We cant do anything He chases us by swimming through the ground It seems all right if were in a high place Lets think of a plan in the meanwhile Yes! Ururu! Ururu!! Im so glad that youre safe Ururu! Chad! This way! Where is he Hes not behind us Whats with him Does that mean that it doesnt matter if its high or low, but it works, as long as theres a wide surface Thats right One down The little lady is safe Bauras belly is connected to an alternate dimensional space Im having her stay there for a while But… she cant live there for long periods of time What Bounts usually only eat souls But only Baura and I can engulf, dissolve and absorb an entire human body You bastard… Give Ururu back! Youre next! Im going to devour you into Bauras space one by one Go, Baura! Okay I wont let you! Roar, Haineko!! It doesnt matter! Just swallow them! What! Diving into the ground was your specialty, wasnt it Y-You bastard! And… you should watch your head! What! Blasted Soul Reaper Shes making a fool of me! They havent gone that far Were going after them, Baura! Okay Is it really safe here It should be safe He cant make any exits in space if he doesnt have a space wide enough Is that so I sense enormous energy when he moves through space He cant physically open it up in cramped spaces Chad! I wont tell you not to worry, but this is not your fault My power is… It should be the power to protect someone At this rate… Find out why you have those… big strong fists Ill hit him for you Ill risk my life to protect it if its something youd risk your life to do At this rate…theres no meaning to it Chad…you… Now lets go save Ururu Calm down What were you planning to do Do you have some sort of plan I would take her place Out of the question! Theres no way that hed release Ururu because of that! They only think of humans as food! Weve got to think of a plan Umm… What I can suck him into my space Tell me more! He has an alternate dimensional space within his body Ill extinguish his energy by surrounding him with my power If I do that, I should be able to move everything hes swallowed through space Is that possible It should work in the same way that alternate dimensional spaces are created by spiritual energy Its possible Hmm… Thats the only method, huh All right What should we do I want you to lure him in front of me without him noticing All right Ill be the decoy Wait! Ill be the decoy! Support me from the back! But… Then youll be in danger! Chad! Who do you think youre talking to A-All right… All right! Then, lets go! Come on! Both of you, stop wasting time Come on all ready! Hey, Gramps! Youre nearby, arent you! Come out already! Im right here! Your attacks are predictable! Hold on, Chad! Stop! I cant tell where he is! Wh-Whats wrong, Baura! What! You fell for it! Boy! Curse you youngsters! Do you know how many souls Ive sucked in order to gain this power! I wont lose to the likes of you! What! Noba! No problem Thank goodness… Are you all right Wheres Ururu Yeah… Immediately Whats wrong, Noba! Noba! Noba! Dont come near me… Could it be! What! Noba--! Get a hold of yourself! Noba… Youve been quite entertaining, but youre 100 years too early to be sealing us away Shall we put an end to this already Sky blue dreams shine and flicker, dancing away into the sky The flowers glow and fade away The sky falls silent, as a pair of dreamy fireworks (Hanabi) lit up I will sing my piercing love to you Can you hear my voice Blooming in an instant are fireworks (Hanabi) Sky blue dreams shine and flicker, dancing away into the sky Blossom away in full bloom, high above Protect and keep those feelings thriving Strongly, at least till the very end These flowers will glow and fade away Im hungry… Why dont we all go out to eat after we defeat those Bounts I want to eat a sashimi meal Ill have a fried fish meal I want something refined, like boiled fish and a drink! How can you eat fish after fighting someone like that No problem No problem The Golden Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers after these messages!! Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! Golden!

Its no good! I guess this means hes not letting us get away Flash Step… Its no good… I cant go that far with my current, limited Spiritual Pressure Its difficult to fly while carrying the both of them… What in the world should I do-- Rangiku You could manage if it was just you Leave us behind and run! You can use us as decoys You could manage if it was just you… I cant do that! Stop saying silly things and just think about getting away! When he attacks, were going to run as far as possible with my Flash Step! All right… Made you look! Damn! Noba! You did it in that condition… No problem Weve bought ourselves some time, but it wont be long before he catches up to us The Spiritual Pressure thats clashing across town… Its probably… Shuhei and the others Weve gotten quite far away from them It seems they lured us out With Noba in this condition, it looks like its impossible to neutralize the enemys power Were going to immobilize the doll and catch it Then were going to make it cough up Ururu Dont put it so simply Its because of Noba that we can tell when hes going to appear Its hard enough as it is to dodge… We cant make an aimed counter attack in that instant We cant deal any damage just by attacking it haphazardly If we at least knew when hell appear, I could attack his belly where his scales look thin We need someone to be a decoy again At any rate, its dangerous for us to stay here Lets move Yeah! Noba, well leave your gigai here Gigai Noba is a mod soul created for anti-Bount use This body is a gigai that Urahara made Is that why he could tell where the Bounts were Rangiku, could you take out Nobas Gikongan, Soul Candy A Soul Reaper can do it, right Chad… Im all right… Mod souls wont die… as long as…their pills arent destroyed But…! No problem… I can still move through space with this body Noba… Maybe… Maybe we can still manage If we can combine my kido with Nobas Bount tracking power, we may be able to catch that Bount What But it might use up the rest of our spiritual power Its all over if we miss What must I do Noba! We were created to defeat the Bounts Countless souls have already fallen victim to them Ill do what I can All right We have one chance Noba and I are going to use kido to drag him out We cant move during that time, so youre going to attack Blow him away with the same attack that surprised Captain Kyoraku!

Oh… Im back U-Ururu… Curse you kids! Thatll be enough for today Well finish this later! Dont say whatever you like! Baura!

DEPARTMENT OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT This is it! This is it! This is the Bount data! I dont know who hid it, but it wasnt anything that I couldnt handle! But this is really interesting! I never knew that the Bounts had such a secret I wonder if I can get my hands on a Bount and do research on it I think its easiest if I go to the World of the Living, but… Theres no time for that And the Soul Reapers who have gone to the World of the Living to watch the Bounts… There isnt enough time to get one of them to help me, either I wonder if theres something I could do This is… I see… So this is why they needed a certain Quincy! A person with special abilities who can bind his reishi, deny their unification and force that to become power That man could do it… Nemu! Yes, Master Mayuri Take research material Q141 with you and go to the World of the Living right now! Yes, Master Mayuri Q141, correct And once it is delivered into that mans hands… Damn!

Calm down, Renji Shut up!

Hell be saved Its all right Ichigo… Hanataro saved me in Soul Society… when I thought I couldnt go on any longer Lets trust him Were going to focus on fighting We cant continue to let the Bounts do whatever they want! Ive gotten pretty soft if youre lecturing me! Hey! What did you say! URAHARAS SHOP Kurosaki, can I talk to you for a moment The Bounts are stronger than anticipated Yeah… I know Can you win without using your Bankai Well… I cant use my Bankai yet, but… How should I put it… It feels like… I can almost do it Ill manage I see I understand Ill leave it to you What are you doing in front of the enemys hideout What were you going to do if they found you! Its all right They already have Its frustrating, but the Bounts seem pretty formidable Lets go! Im not very good at working in groups I see… But… Its hard to believe, but its true I wouldnt call you here if that wasnt the case Captain Kurotsuchi cant fool me No matter how hard he tries to hide it… A blatantly destructive movement is in the works Just like last nights ruckus There is a traitor… among us Soul Reapers Could it be… Aizen I cant say that there isnt a possibility, but I dont think hed help the Bounts Then… We know how many Soul Reapers have left us Well soon finish investigating them That aside… I have a favor I want to ask of you I know that of the four great noble families… the one in charge of compiling Soul Societys history is the Kuchiki family Records of the Bounts… Do any exist Sorry, but could you check All right Kon, are you coming, too Shut up!

But I… Can you hear me My name is Ugaki Im a Bount My dolls name is Gesell Pleased to meet you You bastard! Whats the meaning of this! Please, listen to what I have to say We are absorbing countless souls which have been gathered by Bitto And what happened We were able to amplify the power of our dolls and ourselves to an unbelievable degree! We wont let you leave those strange bugs around! How insulting to call them strange bugs! Theyre the new doll that was born from Yoshinos life Weve gained the concentrated extract of living souls and have evolved even further But even so, we are still sad! We are human! Were not monsters, but humans! Despite that, humans treated us horribly just because we had slightly different abilities Rejection! Persecution! We have no method of leaving descendants The total number of our tribe is decided We can only decrease in numbers You cannot understand this pain I dont understand! Renji! Its not as if we cant sympathize with your situation! But that gives you no right to take other peoples lives! I cant forgive you!

Whats wrong, Gesell! My Wabisuke multiplies the weight of whatever it cuts If I cut it twice, it doubles that, if I cut it once more, it doubles once more Ive sealed away that arm! What! Curse you! He has one more arm Kira! Yes! You stupid Soul Reapers--! Looks like Ive got to call Gesell back in order to escape that ability, huh Return, Gesell! Weve returned the favor Hisagi! Kira! Are you two okay! Abarai! Kurosaki! Go on ahead of us! Ayasegawa should be there! Well find a different route and catch up to you! But… That guy was probably the guard dog to this hideout!

Are you all right! Yumichika! To think I let him… do this to me It seems that things have become quite ugly Its Zaraki Squads style to lose only when you die I cant face my Captain and the others like this Oh Youre still breathing… Soul Reapers are pretty persistent, arent they You bastard… Where are you hiding! Come out! Damn! If he wont come out, then well defeat his doll and drag him out! Ichigo! Could you leave this to me Teamwork isnt so bad… Urahara taught me that direct attacks arent the only means of fighting, and I understand that But… Ive been thinking that lately, Ive become used to those situations and Ive been letting my guard down What are you talking about I remembered… The way we do things, fights are one-on-one We lose when we die If Im going to die, Im going to go all out! Renji… I couldnt save a single child At that time, I might have thought that someone would come to save me URAHARAS SHOP But… I only put that kid in danger It seems that Ive become soft ever since Ive come to the World of the Living If I dont show more spirit right now, I cant return to Soul Society!

So theyve arrived… What should we do The situation has changed Ugaki, finish this at once! I understand So youve come out That fighting spirit is quite impressive! I never expected you to confront me, knowing that youll die How foolish Its easy for me to finish you off Fine I will respect your feelings and crumble your snake with Gesells power This is the end!

I would have preferred if you were buried along with Gesell What! Well, thats fine It seems itll take a little longer to get what I seek Th-This is impossible… Why! You bastard… Did you intentionally collapse the area around him! Who knows The foundation loosened due to that redheaded Soul Reapers attack Whatever the case, the wall fell on its own What do you mean, valuable tribe! You used one of your allies as a pawn to slow us down! I didnt plan to Its just that things are going slightly faster than planned We have to prepare to leave the World of the Living Leave the World of the Living!

What was that just now! It sounded like it came from the back Do you suppose its Ichigo and the others Judging from the volume, it sounds like a fierce battle I cant stay here Ive got to go on Kuchiki, you shouldnt push yourself yet! But… Whats wrong, Sado You… What did you say! Long ago, Soul Society performed a certain experiment Were not sure what its purpose was… But its clear that at the time they only thought of humans as test subjects The name of the one who was responsible for this great crime is in the records Anyway, that began because of his madness There was a sudden, giant explosion Something created by that unexpected phenomenon mutated certain souls in the cycle of rebirth And those with different abilities began to appear in the World of the Living during a certain time period all over the world Those are the Bounts At first, we worried about our differences Everyday we worried that those around us would notice But it was not something we could hide Though we were human, we were called demons and monsters We were forced to live in a world of darkness And when Soul Society learned of our existence they kindly gave us a hand But that was just a part of their plan Without that knowledge, many of us tried to live with the Soul Reapers This tunnel is a capital where our many comrades lived in secrecy to escape persecution Its pretty big, isnt it Thats how many of us there were But now there are only a few You understand, dont you They used dirty tricks to try to erase us from history We will never ever forgive them… Soul Society… The Bounts wish for the annihilation of Soul Society! This is the truth I dont understand Soul Society did something to you… But… No matter what horrible things happened to you, you shouldnt take the lives of your fellow… Humans! I cant forgive you! Getsugatensho! You had this much power left But this is it… What! Bastard! Its useless You dont have the power to defeat me Living souls have given me even greater power We Bounts can keep growing stronger Soul Societys Soul Reapers are insignificant! Theyll soon kneel before us! Damn! Is this it No… I… didnt come all this way… by myself I wont… let it end in a place like this! Zangetsu… Zangetsu Is that the name of the zanpakuto Heh… Shut up… What…are you doing I hear that a Soul Reapers zanpakuto is like the alter ego of that Soul Reaper Would you consider it a partner How about being killed by that partner Bastard… Im going to finish you off with this blade Say… Zangetsu… What are you doing What are you talking about Show yourself… What…are you doing! Zangetsu! Old Man… Are you prepared I really might have been relying on you too much Ive had my Bankai if things got bad Ive even been told that by Urahara, so I must have thought that somewhere within my heart A Bankai is… the extreme readiness that involves blades and pain Dont be afraid, Ichigo! Your blade will dim if you have hesitations You once gained power with an unwavering heart I will ask you once more… What are you preparing to do Why are you fighting For whom do you want the power I remembered… I wanted to become a Soul Reaper in order to protect those important to me I was able to get a hold of my Bankai by swearing on my soul… That I was prepared to shorten my life Zangetsu…lend me your power! The power to protect everyone! I am your power… Trust your own power! Yeah… You! What did you do! Here I go! This is what Im prepared to do! Bankai! Tensa Zangetsu! A…Bankai! Master Kariya! Dont make a fuss, Ichinose! Concentrate on controlling the Senkaimon! Hell come soon! I understand Stand! I can see you… Its past here! Yes Lets hurry! Dont rush in! You dodged that well Hmm… Indeed, its worth being boastful about Lets end this now Fine… What the--! Ishida… – Kurosaki! – Ichigo, are you all right! Inoue! Chad! Rukia! But… Ishida… that look… I cant remain a burden to you forever Your Quincy powers have returned Not completely Ive heard that… this is a battle accessory which was passed down between some Quincies several hundred years ago It has the power to control reishi! Oh Dont miss this time, Quincy! I didnt miss that earlier shot Ishida… Hirenkyaku… It seems your power has really returned Ichinose! Are you prepared yet! Yes… Here you go… Mache sogleich das tor, fur unsere bount auf! – What do you plan to do! – Dont move, Kurosaki! What are you going to do! Its opened, Ishida! No…it hasnt opened yet So what are you going to do, Quincy Are you all right, Inoue Th-Thank you, Sado Oh What is Ishida going to do I wonder if Ishida is going to destroy that gate – Ah! Its as I expected of him! – Thats a good idea! – Give it your best! Im with you! – Ishida, do it! Whats with…this odd feeling Ishida, you… Sorry, Kurosaki… Let me do what I want to I thank you, Quincy boy Now we can finally go Wh-What are you talking about--! It means that the path to Soul Society has just opened What! – So you did know…Quincy – Yeah… The Soul Reaper who gave me this Quincy power told me Also about why you were persistently chasing after me I see… A Bount who gains concentrated souls can open spaces to different dimensions But one must convert their body to Reishi in order to go to Soul Society Unfortunately, we dont have that power But there are a few among the Quincies who can freely control reishi If we use the arrow of the person who has that power as a conductor… Reishi conversion is possible Then…that thing earlier was… Yeah The Kojaku arrow I released earlier passed through the Senkaimon to make it into a reishi conversion gate that would convert them into souls Ishida! Why are you helping them! I believed that you would come… Like the Bounts, Soul Society is an enemy to the Quincies But I was really disappointed when I learned that you had lost your powers But Yoshino supported you in a good way Im grateful to her She not only got us Bitto, but was able to lead your Quincy powers back to me And youve regained your Quincy powers Now lets walk together, the Last Quincy Dont get the wrong idea, Kariya! Im letting you go to Soul Society so I can settle this with you there! So youre avenging Yoshino How silly… Cant you see the bigger picture Im going to defeat you! On my pride as a Quincy! Well…thats fine too Master Kariya! It seems its time… Quincy! Soul Reaper Boy! Follow us if you want to! Well be waiting on the other side! Ishida! What do you think youre doing! Ichigo! Ishida! Yoruichi… I was too late… – Kurosaki! – Ishida! What in the world happened! Ishida…youve done a troublesome thing Why Why did you do it Kurosaki… Indeed, youve regained your Bankai power but would we have been able to defeat him if we continued fighting Wha--! Well… We dont know that unless we try! It would have probably been difficult! Yoruichi… This… This is all I have… to defeat him! Indeed… This is a Quincys power But I cannot defeat him…Kariya, with this level of power That tool forcefully gathers the reishi that exists in the air and forces it out Since theres little reishi in the World of the Living, this is probably the best you can do But what would happen in Soul Society where everything is made of reishi I knew what was going to happen if I tried to settle this here But if we go to Soul Society… Like I said earlier, that kind of thinking is shallow! Quincies and Soul Reapers arent the only things that become more powerful in Soul Society! Bounts also get stronger! What do you mean, Yoruichi! If they go to Soul Society, where all matter is made of reishi… they can absorb all the reishi they want! What! – This is awful… – And Ishida, do you know what kind of thing that Quincy tool is Yes It forcefully brings out a Quincys power Its power isnt stable I dont know when itll stop working But… Even so, I need this power! What you did may lead to the destruction of the world! What are you doing, Kurosaki! Ishida, why are you taking your time! Lets go to Soul Society! Kurosaki… You should do what you wanted to do! Well cover the rest for you! Jeez Youre all so hopeless Thank you… You all… Well, weve come this far It cant be helped We have to finish this by mobilizing all of Soul Societys Soul Reapers That may be the best thing to do Soul Society was the one who created the Bounts Soul Society needs to take responsibility, even if it has to see blood or become wounded Hey! – Renji! – Youre safe! Of course I am! Dont just kill me off! Where are the Bounts Youre too late Weve failed our mission… What an unbeautiful end Damn it… We can pay them back in Soul Society! Lets go! But how Sado and I… Dont worry Theres the Senkaimon that the Bounts left We can probably use it if we adjust it a little Oh! I see… Hold on a second Hello, Captain Its me! How are you Whats going on! Hold just one second! Were going, too! There arent Bount sensors there, are there Youre right…well be counting on you! I-I guess Ill go back home It doesnt matter, but youll be home alone! Home alone No! Sister! Please take me! Oh, Ive asked captain, so its all right to go! Please dont leave me alone! All right! Lets go to Soul Society!

Dont make a fuss! If I recall… There was a Bount who could control a person like a puppet… Theres a high possibility that the Bount took control when he came into contact with him… If thats the case, there may be others… Is there anyone else who encountered the Bount Yes! We were around East Street Two… What are you doing! Hold him down! Protect the Captain! Captain, well take care of this! Captain, take care of your wounds! How many of them are there! Whats going on!

This is just like the time Rukia was being controlled! Damn! Thats good, Ritze… Thats the spirit! Keep that up! This strong Spiritual Pressure…and… What Yes A number of Soul Reapers have fallen into the hands of the Ryoka and are attacking their allies Whats the meaning of this They are being controlled by a Bounts doll… It is the work of a Bount whom I met in the World of the Living Is there a way to regain control It’s inside their bodies, so its difficult to defeat only the doll… The puppets should be brought under control if the one whos controlling them is defeated… At any rate, I must get that Bount… Who’s there! A Bount! I came to take a look when I sensed a strong Spiritual Pressure… Youre a captain, arent you Plus, youve also been injected with the Bittos poison, haven’t you So this is your doing… If I condense a living soul and leave it alone… Itll rot What! Youre going to die soon Dont look at me like that Theres no way to counteract the poison, you see… Just as I’d expect from you, but the poison will work faster if you move Its disadvantageous for me to drag this out… In that case… Kill all enemy with your venom! Suzumebachi! Youre not getting away! Why you…! So this is the Homonka… I know about it I’m supposed to die if I get hit in the same place twice, right But…is time almost up Youre going to die soon! Im going to hide and take my time watching you until then Why you…! Just die, you idiot! Wait! Hisagi! Yes Its as you say The puppet seems to be completely fused within the body… Yes… Theyll probably go out of control once they regain consciousness… Lets move them to the Squad 4 barracks Huh I want Captain Unohanas opinion There’s no one else who can do anything for them in this condition Yes! Move these people to the relief station! Yes! This is a request from Squad 7’s Captain Komamura, isnt it Yes! Theyve been knocked unconscious for the time being… But we dont know how many people have been contaminated Wed like you to tell us… how to deal with this This is… Whats wrong His mind and body are being strongly controlled Extraction on the scene is probably impossible So what should we do At any rate, bring in those who are being controlled by the doll Lets stop their movement Yes! Its an unreliable method, but the only thing we can do is to give it our best Make preparations Yes! Damn… Its painful… I cant see…in front of me What in the world should I do I never thought that… I was so helpless… What should I do…Madam Yoruichi Thats it…thats it! Captain! Dont bother with me! Defeat your own enemies! Come on! Put the next one in this bed! Hey! That patient goes in that room! Look sharp! Captain… I cant send orders to some of the Ritzes Why Curse those Soul Reapers Are they knocking out those who Ritze is attached to Its pointless… With my increased power… I can multiply Ritze as much as I want! Go, Ritze! Understood! Understood! This is simple… Come to think of it, its almost that Soul Reaper’s time… It might be good to make her feel a little more despair… Go somewhere else! Bakudo Number One! Sai! Renji, thats wonderful! You can even fight with Kido! Yeah Im using this because I cant use Zabimaru… Wait a sec… You were subtly making fun of me, werent you About what Is it really so unusual that I can fight with Kido! I am a Lieutenant! Yes! I found you Hey… So this is where you were… Are you still alive Youre almost dead, arent you… I was thinking of hiding until you died, but… Then…why did you come out I sensed that the Soul Reapers were sealing away my Ritzes one-by-one… So I was thinking of hitting them with someone strong Are you thinking of using me I cant stand Ritze being harmed What are you looking at Are you thinking of hitting this spot once more Do you want to kill me Its impossible! Wait! The Punishment Force! Captain! Are you all right! Oh Therere still a few left This is unforgivable! You desperately rushed here when your captain was in danger How touching… Captain! Well take you to the relief station at once! But I wonder if theyre really your allies… What! Ritze! Yes! Too bad… All of your henchmen already belong to Ritze! Get her! Whats wrong with all of you! How does it feel to be held back by your own subordinates You scum! Youre sure good at talking despite not being able to move Im going to take your body Im going to enslave it with Ritzes power until you die! Why you…! Its useless… Ritze! Yes! Too bad Good bye, Captain Im going now! What! Homonka: Second Strike! Why you… How are you able to move! Who do you think I am I detoxified your poison already Thats… I was trained to be in the Punishment Force since I was young So I am already able to resist most poisons And I also know a way to build resistance to a new poison Fight poison with poison… using Suzumebachi Then why did you act as if you couldnt move It was all or nothing There was no chance I could return my subordinates back to normal if you didnt come after me My precious subordinates! This is it Dont underestimate me…Ritze! Understood! I still have Ritze… If I kill you, this poison… Whats wrong Are you shaking so much that you cant move Huh How foolish… Damn you! Ritze, get her! Yes, yes! Yes, yes! Whats this! Hey, Ritze, stop that! Not me! That woman! Kill that woman! Understood! Understood! Ritze! Why! Your doll’s power is a double-edged sword… I hear that it rebounds back to the controller if his power weakens Ritze, stop! Stop! Its useless… Suzumebachis poison is already affecting your body Wh-Whats this Whats going on The dolls presence has suddenly disappeared! Astounding! Whats the meaning of this! It seems that someone has defeated the controller… Its all right now Mabashis Spiritual Pressure disappeared… In the end, you were just too naive How pathetic So it was Mabashis Spiritual Pressure that disappeared… The enemy is pretty good… Now then, that person hiding over there Isnt it about time you came out Oh How did you know I tried to copy you and hide my Spiritual Pressure… Even if you hide your Spiritual Pressure, anyone could find you if youre that bloodthirsty Sorry… I was searching for Ichinose… Where is he Who knows His Spiritual Pressure disappeared long ago… Do you suppose one of your allies did it Hmm… What a waste… It cant be helped, then Ill settle for you Im going to make you pay for embarrassing me Well, well… You underestimate me… Well, fine… Its my job…to erase Captains… You always lament on how boring this town is …Searching for a place in the sun The melody you hum is that rusty, same old song …Rejecting any new song Youre anxious because somewhere in your heart, you believe in the future Baby, its you; That pain will eventually become a memory Youre the only one Dont think, just feel, let your whole body tremble; future is you!!

" I want to live in a world of peace Without conflict, like the one I dreamed of I cant be patient any longer There are things I must say At the evening bus stop on the way home I Wave to those sunken shoulders, Bye Bye Bye Got to show your Fighting Pose, Oh! Oh! That world I dreamed of Is peaceful every day, without any conflict But in reality, there are troubles every day And sometimes I regret, these Rolling days Lies probably have little meaning ~All my loving Otherwise, how can I go on A Sweet Love I dreamed of Where lovers search for a hideaway But in reality, the days we cant meet Go on; but we still believe, these Rolling days We may stumble, but Way to go!! Yeah!! Yeah!! A mud-caked Rolling star!! It was Mabashis Spiritual Pressure that disappeared… The enemy is pretty good… Now then, that person hiding over there Isnt it about time you came out Oh How did you know I tried to copy you and hide my Spiritual Pressure… Even if you hide your Spiritual Pressure, anyone could find you if youre that bloodthirsty Sorry… I was searching for Ichinose… Where is he Who knows His Spiritual Pressure disappeared long ago… Do you suppose one of your allies did it Hmm… What a waste… It cant be helped, then Ill settle for you Im going to make you pay for embarrassing me Well, well… You underestimate me… Well, fine… Its my job…to erase Captains… Baura Oh Boss, is he the next opponent Thats right… Hes not like the small fries youve been fighting until now Hes a captain of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads Okay It seems like Ill have fun today Is that the doll that you use My doll Baura Whats so funny Sorry I was just thinking that the Bounts are really interesting indeed Do you know the source of your power It comes from Soul Societys ancient technology What about it It was a technology that was deemed dangerous and sealed away because of a single accident How regretful… Even I dont have any complete data left But… Heres a proposal Would you like to be my research subjects What! To be honest, in the beginning, I never cared about the Bounts, but… I became interested when I was looking at various data I wanted to do… my own research Its all right Ill try to make it as painless as possible Ill even forget that you used me to return that Quincys power Unfortunately… I refuse Our goal is the destruction of Seireitei To do that, I must remove those in our way Baura! Okay My, my… Oh well… Then… Im going to make you regret that! Thats nice Spiritual Pressure But it doesnt matter how strong your Spiritual Pressure is Ive received reports If I recall correctly… Youre a mole, arent you You can only appear from large surfaces like the ground or walls To try that on me in the World of the Living is one thing, but its pointless here Tear him up Ashisogijizo Now then… Come quickly Im over here What is this I never heard about…this ability Dont underestimate me! Ive got you! You barely dodged that… Why you…! Didnt you know… We Bounts have gotten stronger by absorbing large quantities of high-quality reishi since coming to Soul Society The ground isnt the only thing that’s Bauras space now This sky, which is filled with reishi, is all Bauras space! Theres nowhere for you to hide You call yourself a captain, but this is it… How boring… This is… The elevation of a Soul Reaper captains Spiritual Pressure… Did someone fight a Bount That temporary fight amongst Soul Reapers was also the work of the Bounts… Damn! Curse those Bounts! Please hold up My, my… How dare you do that to me! Jeez… How annoying! Oh You have an amusing body… Shut up! Youre just an experiment subject! Dont talk so big! Im going to make you shut up, right now Baura! Okay! Dont think that Ill fall for the same trick twice I would have brought Nemu if I knew this was the case It would have saved me a lot of trouble if I had used her as a decoy… He always hides himself in an alternate space when hes moving… But he always shows himself when he attacks and engulfs everything around him In that case… This place is just right Come on Come out Bount! I found you, Bount! When you appear from an alternate space, you have to swallow everything in your way! With this many obstacles floating in the air, I can sense your movements! What! Tear him up Ashisogijizo! Its over What! Thats pretty good… Humph! It seems that it was a bit shallow Why you… Fine… If Ive come this far, I can finish you off easily afterwards Whoops, as an experiment subject, I cant finish you off… Ive got to keep you somewhat alive Will it go that well What This world is full of reishi Its a problem if you forget that we Bounts are invincible here This power… Its like the reishi subordination of that Quincy We Bounts absorb reishi like this to heal our wounds Unfortunately, it doesnt matter how many times your attacks hit me Sooner or later, youll run out of spiritual power and youll be the one lying here face down! Whats this! Whos the one wholl be lying face down Ashisogijizo paralyzes the limbs of whomever it cuts… It only cuts off the signals from the brain to move limbs Movement is the only thing it takes Unlike anesthesia, the pain doesnt go away at all Boss! Dont move! It seems that Ashisogijizos power is good against Bounts… With this power, it doesnt matter how much you recover by absorbing reishi This is a new discovery Now then, well continue this at the research facility Baura… Boss! Its useless to do anything Do it! Okay What! He ran away! But Ashisogijizos effect wont wear off, no matter how far apart we are Dont think that you can get away Boss, are you all right Dont worry about me I just absorbed a large amount of reishi These wounds will soon heal But his zanpakutos effect is remaining… Curse that Soul Reaper! I cant disappear here… Baura, counter attack! Okay Just you watch, Soul Reaper! Now then… I wonder how long itll take for him to come after me when he senses my Spiritual Pressure… Im already here You were pretty slow I never thought… you would come this quickly… Hmm… Thats a good expression I was going to finish this all at once as soon as you appeared, but Im glad that I held back I was able to take a good look at you How did you find my location My, my Oh well… Ill tell you if you insist… Id received a report that when the lieutenant of Squad 10 fought you… She was able to track your whereabouts using the Kakushitsuijaku In other words, as long as I have your Spiritual Pressure data… I can track you even if you hide in an alternate space And Ichigo Kurosaki chased you using a mod soul which could sense Bount Spiritual Pressure So I also developed something like this It cant be… Thats right This sensor doesnt function without the proper data I cant tell the locations of all the Bounts, but… your data has already been input It was very tough to receive information from those who returned from the World of the Living With that last battle, Ive made the final adjustments to your Spiritual Pressure record Were you targeting me from the beginning Do you think that it was a coincidence that you met me in Seireitei, as wide as this place is Your body, which has aged from absorbing souls, makes for a great experiment subject Curse you! Now thats enough talk… Lets go to my research room Ill be able to find out more things about Bounts if I study you Its useless to run away Your Spiritual Pressure is completely recorded in here Im not the one whos cornered Its you! Baura! Okay This is… Byakurai! This is the absorbed spiritual power of the Soul Reapers who attacked us before now! What! I never thought that it could move this fast! Baura! Okay! Whats this I sense a Bount! Someone is fighting a Bount! Where Umm… Around that big building! Shishinro, Repentance Cell, huh-- All right Lets hurry! Were just trading blows… You Bount… I cant wait for you to revive Im going to finish this before you inject yourself with that drug! Go, Baura! O-Okay… Why you… Youre getting cocky for an experiment subject! I wont forgive you! Bankai! Wh-Whats this Konjiki Ashisogijizo Konjiki Ashisogijizo turns a deadly poison made from my blood into mist and scatters it Theres nowhere for you to run! A poison…you say Baura! Suck in the poison! Okay, Boss! Baura! Im going to give you all my spiritual power! Okay Im going to suck everything in! Dont get cocky! I was going to keep you alive and make you my experiment subject, but thats enough! Youre finished here! I wont die here! I broke my tribes laws and sucked tens of thousands of human souls… I got this body as a result… Despite that, I never stopped trying to suck more souls in order to increase my powers… All for the sake of becoming the leader of the Bounts! Not Kariya! I am most worthy of leading the Bounts! I wonder about that Go! Konjiki Ashisogijizo! Die Thats… Konjiki Ashisogijizo… Whos having such a flashy fight I thought I told you that theres nowhere to hide Baura! Baura! It seems like you had the ambition to become the leader of the Bounts But it looks like you wont be able to do it W-Wait! Ill give you Bount information… How pathetic… I… I… I… Im no longer interested in you I… Aww… The poison has already spread throughout his system… Oh well… It seems like I wasted my time… Ive used up all the hojiku-zai I had on hand I guess Ill return to the Department of Research and Development How pathetic! Isnt there anyone good around here Damn! Get her! Nieder! Leave it to me! The Quincy boy, huh You always lament on how boring this town is …Searching for a place in the sun The melody you hum is that rusty, same old song …Rejecting any new song Youre anxious because somewhere in your heart, you believe in the future Baby, its you; That pain will eventually become a memory Youre the only one Dont think, just feel, let your whole body tremble; future is you!! Baby, its me; Youre never alone, Im right here We should be as one; Even if you stumble, I don’t mind I want to tell you now about the thing called love Ishida, sorry to interrupt you while youre fighting, but could you do something about that uniform What are you talking about! This is the ancient Quincy uniform! This fashion sense feels like a breath of great history Dont you understand how fabulous it is! I try to but… The Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers Golden after these messages! llustrated guide to Soul Reapers! Golden! Captain Hitsugaya! Kira!

DEPARTMENT OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT It’s a fine day today I leave it to you Understood Lieutenant, what could it be I dont know… But something with immense energy is coming this way Lieutenant! It seems the ryoka has invaded Were going to intercept them! What the heck is this Spiritual Pressure Its different from before! Yeah… Its difficult to tell because of all the battles happening around us, but one of the Bounts’ presences disappeared But this is a different one!

So youre luring me in… Thats pretty interesting You just dont learn Why dont you give up on revenge already This isnt revenge What about you Why are you doing this There is no meaning to this battle Huh What are you talking about For that matter, arent Quincies and Soul Reapers supposed to be enemies Why are you allying yourself with the Soul Reapers Im not allying myself with the Soul Reapers… I just want to stop pointless battles Youre not making any sense… I will put an end to this battle on my pride as a Quincy! Well, fine If you want to die so badly, then just do as you like Rantao…you know about Ishidas artifact, dont you How long will it hold up I dont know It may become useless today… It may be tomorrow… If it goes off accidentally… It may blow away everything… within a radius of several thousand meters… I made up my mind… Ill do this, no matter what happens… I cant allow them to roam freely!

So what are you going to do, Quincy Boy! With that kind of attack, I can only dodge at best… At this rate… If youre not coming, then I will! Thats a pretty gentle attack Damn! What a time for me to lose power Compared to before… its definitely unstable If it’s like this, there’s no point even if it hits… My power went negative on my third attack… Thats why it hardly had any power… When I release… When my energy becomes positive, thats when I have the power to destroy my opponent… But… when that energy swings towards positive… This arrow will be triggered and blow away everything around it… Of course, it will also blow away the person who fired it… Whats wrong, boy! Whats with the long face What are you brooding about! Can I do this Is it possible for me to control this arrow No! Ive got to do this! That should… What! This is my true form! I boast perfect protection in this form! Your attacks are now meaningless! Your attacks are now meaningless! It seems that arrows power is different every time… In other words, he cant control it But if I didnt come out just now… it would have been a bit close Stop with the blasé explanation! Damn… Just when I was able to fire at high power… No Dont give up I mustnt forget this feeling… And keep on firing… Come on! Thats good! Damn! Hit… Hit… Hit! What a fool… Using a weapon that he cant even control… Come on, come on, come on! Say… Say… If you really want to fight me, If you really want to fight me, bring a better weapon now, won’t you bring a better weapon now, won’t you Really What a fool… Youre naive… Where…are you going!

Youre… This man…Hes dangerous… I know… I know that a lot better than you do… Kariya! What do you plan to do with this crest you’re talking about! Defeat me if you wish to know Damn! Whered he go He ran away! Hey! Tell me! Where is the crest that hes searching for! Im very sorry… I dont know Even if we dont know where it is, we can just follow Kariyas Spiritual Pressure… I see! All right Lets go! Its resonating! It seems like its in this room… Where is it Kariya! Bankai! Tensa Zangetsu! I wont let you do as you please!

Ichigo! Kariya! What did you do! In this moment, I have gained the ultimate power What Ultimate…power For eons, I investigated and researched ancient records, And I had Ichinose search for it… He was able to track it to the Department of Research and Development… The name of this original crest is the Jokai Crest It is a crest that can purify and erase everything Jokai Crest… This is where the soul experiments that created the Bounts were done What! When the experiment was canceled after the accident… The incredible energy that made up the entire foundation of the experiment in the Jokai Crest was sealed away… And now… I have become one with that energy… Do you know what this means It means that I can blow away Seireitei at any time by releasing the energy of the Jokai Crest What! Like I’d believe something like that! Believe what you like! I never said that anyone should believe me! Those eyes…hes serious! R-Really So what are you going to do Its fine if you attack me, but Ill release the Jokai Crest when you do… Attack me if you dare! Tell the foolish people of Seireitei… Ill give you a one-day grace period Until then, tremble in suspense! Hey! Wait! Ichigo! Chad! If what he said was true… I wonder if he died Oh my It seems that way Well, we were able to come here, thanks to that kid… Ill thank him for that at least… Where are you going You always lament on how boring this town is …Searching for a place in the sun The melody you hum is that rusty, same old song …Rejecting any new song Youre anxious because somewhere in your heart, you believe in the future Baby, its you; That pain will eventually become a memory Youre the only one Dont think, just feel, let your whole body tremble; future is you!!

This time, my power has dropped… You said that this battle is meaningless, but I never wanted battles to mean anything to begin with! What! Then why do you fight! What is your goal! Kariya said that he was going to exterminate the Soul Reapers of Seireitei… But… I dont care about that I just wanted to run amok… Long ago, it was great I risked my life in battle to get what I wanted… I was satisfied But the world changed… Whats wrong with the strong killing the weak! Ive been thirsty for a long time! I was so thirsty that nothing could help me! But here, I can proudly display the heads Ive taken without reservation! Im surprised you can stand Thats good… Youre making me excited… Now then, Im going to finish you off There are an increasing number of injured among the Squads… How are the captain of Squad 2 and the Punishment Force Yes They are recovering, but most are exhausted and are in no condition to be moved Hmm… That cant be helped… Squad 8 Captain Shunsui Kyoraku Yes… How much have we confirmed from Squad 12’s report Its troublesome… We have confirmed an enormous sealed facility… deep in the basement of the Department of Research and Development What Its something I cannot overlook The Jokai Crest, a sealed-away power that we never knew existed was stolen from us and has fallen into the hands of the Ryoka… According to Soul Reaper substitute, Ichigo Kurosaki, who battled at the scene… the Jokai Crest was used as the source of power for past soul experiments If it accidentally goes off, it can instantaneously turn Seireitei into ashes But the Jokai Crest was sealed away far before… the formation of the Department of Research and Development Even the part about Rantao, the one labeled as the great sinner… We dont know how much of it is true with just this information… Indeed… But whatever the reason, its also true that Central 46 of that time… completely sealed it away and had its existence erased from the records I cant say that the immense power that the Ryoka spoke of was fake Whatever the case, I want to tell everyone to do their best to track the Ryoka Yes! Yes! Jokai Crest Thats right I never thought that such a thing existed… Yeah… Now we can blow away Seireitei Everything will be decided after one day! It feels good Kariya, you dont have to go that far! Are you worried about me Its all right I wont die that easily No! Im saying that this is outrageous! Several of our comrades Spiritual Pressures have already disappeared… Its enough, isnt it! If you have that much power, you should use it to make the Soul Reapers kneel before you… Its no good! Why! Our goal is revenge But even so, what good will it do if everyones dead! Whats the point in that That’s the way it should be Kariya, you cant mean… Ive been thinking about this since the first time we met… Youre a blade that cannot be controlled… The Bounts went through hardships and got carried away with your spirit… Thats why I was following you until today, but… If youre going to use the Jokai Crest, then that changes things… If it is the source of our tribes power, as you say, then we shouldnt use it as a weapon I like that serious side of you, Koga… Kariya, dont do it… Thats like spitting on the heavens! Ive been with you for a long time Im really grateful to you Ka…ri…ya… Oh my I thought you were just a regular kid, but… You have a pretty determined look… A Quincys arrow is only released in the name of Justice Justice… Justice, that is, for those youve sworn to protect… Theres nothing difficult aside from the basics I have just taught you Everything, from there on… depends on your heart Heart… Quincies release arrows with their hearts… in the name of Justice Master… Ill give it a try… Ill release an arrow with my heart… In the name of Justice Thats pretty impressive… To think you’re powers would increase at this point… But it seems that youre reaching your limit… Please… Hold up! Its my turn! What! Yes! Whats wrong What are you doing! Oh my It’s because you carelessly returned me! Its not my fault! What was that just now Could it be It seems like you didnt do that on purpose… It went off by accident In that case… Please…hold up! Youre already at your limit! Dont you understand that my defense is impregnable! This is the end… Why! Those dolls make their own decisions while youre fused with them Thats why you had superhuman abilities But its different when you undo your transformation You cant attack when youre defending You cant defend when youre attacking Thats why… whenever you change forms, you have to change back to your original form with your own will When my Kojaku accidentally went off, you were sure you had won and carelessly undid your fusion You couldnt react at all to the second arrow that appeared In other words, a small time lag is created there Thats your only and greatest weakness But how did you fire that second shot My master told me… “An arrow is not fired, it is released…” And a Quincys arrow is released with the heart… I lose… It was fun… SEIREITEI LIBRARY My, my… Someone whos faking sickness shouldnt be coughing for real… Did you discover anything A little… But the data is vast… So what did the enemy say Hes given us a days grace period Come tomorrow… Boom! I see… Take a look at this… Its a summary of the Jokai Crest Its author is Rantao… Why is something like this here The person called Rantao is incredibly clever People want to know secrets… They especially want to enter places where the secret might be located… The most targeted places in those cases are official information storage facilities But its pretty difficult to find if its turned into a document and hidden amongst lots of other documents… Oh I once confirmed with Captain Hitsugaya that the Bount data disappeared from here I thought that there might be something important here It seems that the person who erased the data didnt notice the documents on the Jokai Crest… And… I found the Jokai Crest document by accident… But I think theres something else… Something else The important part isnt written here The writer divided the information among several books and scattered them throughout these numerous books… Whoa… Are we going to search through all of them We still have time until tomorrow Uh…um… Thanks… You came to help me, didnt you My, my… Youre welcome… Master… Youve done your best, Uryu… Why Youve fought enough… You released a wonderful arrow on your pride as a Quincy… No way… I still… People have limits at times You fought to that limit for now Its enough Rest well from now on… I cant do that! I…I still… A heart of vengeance makes a persons heart tough But at times your obstinacy can dull your blade… Take the time to think about that… Master… Ishida! Ishida, did you fight a Bount Yeah… I was able to defeat her… What about you Kariya… That bastard said that he was going to blow away Seireitei by tomorrow What! Dont push yourself… Youre going to stop Kariya, arent you Im going, too!

Are you all right! Get a hold of yourself! I-Im very sorry… We tried to capture him, but… The Ryoka suddenly…released his doll… Im going to call the med squad right now Itll be all right The enemy is still nearby! We’re going after him! This fighting style seems to belong to the Bount that Kira fought in the World of the Living Hes powerful… Be careful! Yes! Yes! Captain Hitsugaya! Rangiku! Renji! Well, well Everyones together! Abarai, why are you here We followed the Bounts Spiritual Pressure The Bounts Spiritual Pressure Oh, thats right! We had you around! I’m around indeed! That’s my job! Whats the meaning of this Oh, you weren’t told about it, were you, Captain This is the mod soul with the Bount sensor that Ichigo and the others… were using in the World of the Living Pleased to meet you… A mod soul Why is it in something like this Well, itll take a while to explain… Are Ichigo Kurosaki and the others using this to search for the Bounts Yes… Hes a lot more useful than he looks! How rude! All right Abarai… Sorry, but could you lend him to me Huh What! Youre going to carry him Buddy-buddy! Its not as if he doesnt match you No! Matsumoto, youre going to carry him! Aww, how boring… Umm… I don’t mind lending him to you, but what should I do Sorry, but take care of my injured squad members Yet again, I can’t fight Dont rush, dont rush… Oh This time Im with a lady! Well now, it sure is more thrilling than being with a stuffy man! Well, excuse me! Oh Are you jealous Is this way all right Yes! There is no mistake! What should we do Surround him! We dont know how much they learned about Soul Society… But were probably more familiar with the geography Understood Squad 10, calling all groups! Squad 10, calling all groups! The Bount that were tracking is currently at North District 2 Center Street Number Two Target is heading south! Groups 1 and 2, change course and head around through East District 6! Groups 3 and 4, take a detour and close off all roads! All other teams are to hurry from North District 3 to the target! All squads begin the siege! The encircling net is getting tighter Say, what should we do Oh my… His Spiritual Pressure! Whats wrong It suddenly weakened! What! Where is it That way! Its in the direction of East District 7 Hey! The Spiritual Pressure didnt disappear, did it Yes! It just weakened and is on the move! Could it be Why are we walking down here Im going to rust… We can buy some time by doing this I want to let loose more! Im still not satisfied! Thats good enough Right now, we have to search for Kariya We cant leave him alone Oh my, how unusual… What You referred to him without a title! There are times like that Did you get into a fight Its not that simple! Then what Its a difference in the way we live… Hide! Oh! Did you find him No! Be careful! Right! Their hands have reached down here as well… What are you going to do Are you still going to run around No We will break through, no matter what And for that, we must strike! How is it It seems that hes going through the underpass As expected of a captain, even if youre small! You take notice of things that others wouldn’t! Once hes noticed, hell probably surface… It would be great if we could track him in the underpass Groups that are investigating the West District, go to the underpass as backup! This is Group 3! Changing course to the northwestern roads! Going as backup! Weve discovered the Ryoka’s doll! Where! West District 6 Street Number Three, the third road heading from the north! All right! Lure the target to a wide road and wait for backup! Lets go! Yes! Oh my… I was just getting excited about this How worthless Group 3! Someone answer! The Spiritual Pressure disappeared again It seems that the battle ended… with our loss No need to say unnecessary things! Yes… All squads, dont be rash! If you encounter the target, restrain yourselves! Tell them to be sure to wait for backup! This is Group 6! We have arrived at South District Street Number Four! Any sign of the Ryoka No… There it is! Ive captured the Bount’s Spiritual Pressure signal! Which way Umm… Its that way, so… its around the area of South District Street Number Four… What! Thats the place were communicating with right now! Group 6! Target confirmed! Hes in your area! Understood! Hes nearby! Dont let your guard down! Right! Requesting all groups to South Street Number Four as backup! It seems theres a butterfly for each of the teams… Dalk, I want you to crush those butterflies All of them at once! My, the poor things… But fine Ill try! Captain! The Hell Butterflies! What! This is Group 7! The Hell Butterflies are… suddenly… Woah! It seems that he has discovered our means of communication! Our communication with all groups has been cut off! Please respond! Lieutenant! Hello, boys! Lets play! Dalk! Here I go! This is horrible! Hey! Are you all right! Hes still breathing! Over there and over here, too! At any rate, they havent been finished off… Why is that! Take care of them! Captain! Mod soul! What about his Spiritual Pressure Yes! Its headed this way! I see… Captain, what are you going to do He knew we were moving as an organization… Thats why hes probably waiting Waiting for the commander to come once all of the subordinates have been defeated… Are you planning to go alone Thats right Matsumoto, take care of the rest! All right Please be careful Good luck Are you the captain Yeah… You’ve sure done it I held back I dont like laying my hands on young people… Then I’ll thank you for that But Im not going to hold back!

Sorry… I lost… No… You did well Thank you Im glad that I was with you Its different from the report… What I heard that a Bount will disappear when he loses his doll, but… Why What is it There were various roles within our tribe My role was to train the young people to become full-fledged Bounts There were some who grew up well and there were those who didnt I just remembered something from long ago… What is this all of a sudden And thats not answering my question! Yeah, thats right The reason why I havent collapsed is because… Dalk still isnt dead! What! Whats that Its Dalk This is her core She lives within this steel As I expected of a captain of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads It seems I cant go on further without using my full strength I have something that I must do Ill eliminate you if you say youre going to get in my way Thats your own reasoning! Quite a bit of Dalks power remains in this ax Im going to pump my Spiritual Pressure into it and strike you! Lets go, Dalk! This is--! This Spiritual Pressure… It seems this is where the real battle starts Then Ill get serious, too! Bankai!! Daiguren…Hyorinmaru! As I expected of a captain of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads However… I cant lose just yet! You still want to continue I must go after Kariya… You’re body cant endure the reishi youve gathered Then Ive got to settle this before it breaks! Lets go, Dalk! This is it, huh I lose… What were you planning to do once you caught up to Kariya There wasnt anything I could have done Whatever the case, that is a dispute between Kariya and me! Where were you planning to go A future with no wars… You always lament on how boring this town is …Searching for a place in the sun The melody you hum is that rusty, same old song …Rejecting any new song Youre anxious because somewhere in your heart, you believe in the future Baby, its you; That pain will eventually become a memory Youre the only one Dont think, just feel, let your whole body tremble; future is you!!

Yeah!! Yeah!! A mud-caked Rolling star!! Oh! It’s the captain! The captain is back! Captain! Captain! Captain! I’m fine I brought down the Bount The South District is frozen over from my Hyorinmaru It will melt shortly, so go and retrieve the Bount Is it still alive No I don’t know if there’s a corpse, but we can’t leave it there Eventually, we’ll have to give it a burial Yes sir! Is Matsumoto back Yes sir! She’s with Lieutenant Abarai of Squad 6, getting medical treatment for those who were injured Also, one more thing… What is it The Substitute Soul Reaper is here, too What! Captain… Welcome back, sir What of the Bount I managed to take care of it Yo, Toshiro I’m using your place You’re doing it on purpose, aren’t you How many times must I tell you It’s Captain Hitsugaya! What’s the big deal It doesn’t matter It does matter! Besides, why are you here We happened to run into Rangiku while chasing after Kariya Yes! Ishida was hurt and we needed a place for him to rest, so it was perfect timing…! Since we don’t have a home base in Seireitei It was a stroke of good fortune that we met up with everyone Sorry, we came uninvited like this Anyway, that’s the story I know it’s an inconvenience, but can you let us rest here a bit I guess I have no choice Ishida… No… I’m okay Are you in pain I was the one who brought the Bounts to this world Whatever injuries I incur, I’ll take full responsibility Inoue would know how to treat a wound like this It can’t be helped Orihime is outside the walls of Seireitei Due to the Bount invasion, there are injured all across Seireitei Squad 4 has their hands full But I’ve sent word, so someone should come in time You’ll be all right You can’t fight, but your life is in no danger That won’t do! I…came here to fight! Don’t be hasty We’ve gotten word that Soi Fon and Kurotsuchi have taken down one Bount each Counting the one I brought down, Kariya’s the only one left I must hand it to you, Captain! That metal doll gave us so much trouble, yet you beat it so easily! It wasn’t easy Not only that… During the battle, that Bount was definitely acting strange He was even going easy on his attacks against the squad members… What happened to Kariya He seems to have gotten some unknown power I think he called it the “Jokai Crest” He said he’s gonna blow up Seireitei with that power Kariya’s actions were unusual even for that other Bount If only we could’ve stopped him then… It’s over No use mulling over it By the way, what happened to Ichinose We received word that Captain Zaraki brought him down Kurosaki! Everyone, are you all right! Please wait! Inoue! Kira! Jidanbo’s injuries are taken care of, so I came after you guys It just so happened that Squad 3 members were guarding the gates So I brought her Thanks Sorry to put you right to work, but can you tend to Ishida’s wounds Yes, sure Inoue, thank you… I don’t need to get back to 100% Just…can you do it quickly Hold on! Rangiku Ishida, weren’t you listening to what’s been said I understand how anxious you are, but calm down a bit! Yes, yes, yes! Rest is essential in a battle, too Everyone’s been on the move since last night! You’re right If something happens, we’ll get word right away It’s no use getting anxious And who’s available now Yes, sir! Mainly Squad 11 Since Squad 11 is without its captain right now, they hadn’t received orders They weren’t involved in the afternoon confusion, so they’re the healthiest squad around right now That’s right, I hadn’t sent any orders to Squad 11 Dammit! I wanted to fight the Bounts myself I hear there’s only one left! Same here! I wanted to pay them back for what they did in the World of the Living And the captain just left and hasn’t returned It seems he fought with a Soul Reaper named Ichinose who sided with the Bounts He’s probably quite happy and sightseeing in the Rukon District Ichinose, huh I owed him some payback That bastard…! Well, the last one standing is a bigwig I’ll find this one with my own hands for sure! Reporting! Seireitei… The North District… There’s nothing suspicious in any of the blocks The other squads are exhausted from the afternoon skirmish If we find him now, we get to do whatever we want! So find him, no matter what! We have an urgent message from Captain Kyoraku of Squad 8 and Captain Ukitake of Squad 13 Wasn’t Captain Ukitake in poor health Yes I’m sorry, but he went to the Central Library in order to find data on the Bounts Hmm… Well, no matter And what is this urgent message The data Rantao left behind has been discovered It has an entry about an explosive power that was sealed in the Jokai Crest I see Which means… that man, Kariya, wasn’t lying According to the data, in order to totally draw out the power in the Jokai Crest… a short period of time is necessary after activating the Jokai Crest And how much time is that About one day… So that’s what Kariya meant when he said everything will be decided in one day Yes, sir… Hmm… To think he’d even use that as a part of his tactics We must not let down our guard against him We must take this Kariya into custody quickly I will send directives to each squad It seems we don’t even have time for a captains’ meeting Yes sir! Tell Captain Ukitake and Captain Kyoraku to continue checking the data Understood, sir! Captain Soi Fon’s recovery was slower than expected, so she is on standby at her quarters I see Captain Kurotsuchi’s ability to return to battle is also very questionable Captains Kyoraku and Ukitake have secluded themselves in the Central Library to gather information What of Captain Komamura He is guarding General Captain Yamamoto All right I understand the situation Good work Thank you If you’ll excuse me… Isane! Rangiku! Make sure you taste my cooking! I’m still on duty…! Are you saying you won’t eat my cooking! Who’s there! You’re…! Rantao! A gun that fires kido How did you find me A Bount sensor Right I’m the one that knows the most about Bounts Why haven’t you given that technology to the Soul Reapers Because…I intend to settle everything by myself! Interesting thing you have there It looks like it packs a punch, but it’s not enough to bring me down What’s the matter That mark… Impossible…! After the konpaku experiment failed, we were sent to the World of the Living Shortly before our arrival, there were reports in the World of the Living about a large number of humans possessing strange powers They were Bounts The Bounts were confused about their strength, yet they tried to live among the normal humans But due to their strength, they weren’t able to remain friendly with humans for long periods of time And finally, they began to be persecuted I tried to get close to the Bounts in order to save them… Because they were victims of our experiments Do not fear me I am your friend I rounded up the Bounts and advised them to stay together and hide I will return to Soul Society and make arrangements so that you will be under the protection of Soul Society Is that possible… Yes It’s true that this will not be an easy task It will probably take several years before protection of the Bounts becomes a reality I understand We will wait here until you return But something totally unexpected awaited me when I returned to Soul Society The Central 46 of that time decided that everything regarding the konpaku experiment as well as its by-product, the Bounts, would be buried in secrecy Why are you going to turn your backs on the Bounts! We acknowledge that the konpaku experiment was inhumane If you believe that, why won’t you save them They possess amazing power! If we ignore them, they may even become a danger to Soul Society! Bounts who cannot control reishi cannot pass through the Dangai, Precipice World They will never be a threat to Soul Society However… That is not the case in the World of the Living Our duty is to regulate the balance of konpaku There is a possibility the Bounts threaten that equilibrium You don’t mean the Bounts will be… Do you actually believe such a thing can be allowed! No, we don’t We must live with the burden of our mistake and strive to never repeat such a mistake again! I cannot…I cannot turn my back on the Bounts! Take them all into custody! Kill any who resist! What! In order to save the Bounts, I went to the World of the Living without permission There are still comrades further inside! All right! I’ll do something Go on and get away! Thank you! Hey you! Are you all right Who are you! Aren’t you…Rantao I… Rantao… You belong to the Bount Investigation Unit! The Investigation Unit has already returned to Soul Society What are you doing here! She’s running away! Where do you think you’re going! After her! She’s a traitor! After her! After her! I will distract the Soul Reapers, so you must escape during that time Huh If you go outside, there are sure to be other Bounts Run away with your comrades But then you… I’ll be fine… Take this The Bounts have much more power hidden within them This will help to draw out that power I’m really sorry You’ll be forced to endure suffering now, but I’m sure one day… So you must live! Over this way! Don’t let her get away! Now! Run up those stairs and get outside! In the end, I was captured and taken to Soul Society And Seireitei held me solely responsible and put a seal on the case Subsequently, the Bounts took advantage of the powers hidden in the item I gave the boy, and perfected the method of controlling dolls With their new power, the Bounts planned their revenge and tried to attack Soul Society countless times However, they were rejected each time by the Soul Reapers and their numbers dwindled to almost nothing… and even the record of their existence was erased from Seireitei But I have never forgotten the Bounts Then you came to Soul Society You are that boy… Don’t you remember How you got that mark That mark is sure to have appeared when you activated a certain item The one who gave you that item was me! I have lived to save you There is no Soul Reaper remaining who remembers the past! Soul Society has changed, too Now, I can… What a thing to bring up now! It’s not a lie! If you use the power of the Jokai Crest which was sealed in the Seireitei…! The power of the Jokai Crest I absorbed that energy into my body long ago Impossible! I’ll use that power to destroy the Soul Reapers What! This Spiritual Pressure is coming from Rantao! Is she in a battle The only Bount remaining is Kariya So Kariya is sure to be where Rantao is! Whatever action you planned is too late The only Bount remaining is me Even if it’s only you, I will save you! So stupid! You created Bounts I intended to deal with you after you had seen Seireitei destroyed and repented for what you had done But you can die right here!

Yeah!! Yeah!! A mud-caked Rolling star!! Whatever action you planned is too late Even if it’s only you, I will save you! But you can die right here! Who is that A Soul Reaper What! Don’t worry She came from a place called Soul Society in order to save us Soul Reaper… What are you doing Huh! Well… Err… You’re a very young Bount, aren’t you Y-Yes I understand it’s very rare for Bount powers to awaken in a young child like you Everyone has hope in you Huh Do your best We intend to do all we can so that you can live free of worries Oh… Y-Yes… Shortly thereafter, the Soul Reapers returned to Soul Society to plan our salvation We were left behind to continue building the city, waiting patiently for the Soul Reapers to return one day I was very young, but I helped the grown-ups around me The adults placed all their hopes on the Soul Reapers But their hopes were cruelly dashed What! Hey, hang on! Take them all into custody! Kill any who resist! R-Run! Don’t let even one get away! Get them! You find him! No! Find him! Do not let him get away from us! You there! Are you all right She’s that Soul Reaper from before, but… I will distract the Soul Reapers, so you must escape during that time Huh If you go outside, there are sure to be other Bounts Run away with your comrades But then you… I’ll be fine Take this… The Bounts have much more power hidden within them This will help to draw out that power I’m really sorry You’ll be forced to endure suffering now, but I’m sure one day… So you must live! Lady… Now, hide… That’s the last time I saw that Soul Reaper I somehow managed to escape from that cave And together with the Bounts who survived, I began a life of wandering once again But we were like food thrown into a den of wild animals We Bounts who possessed spiritual power became ideal prey for the Hollows Pursued by Hollows, my despair and bitterness towards the Soul Reapers grew steadily stronger Who are you… I feel power growing inside me That was my first experience merging with a doll There had always been Bounts who could naturally summon the power to control dolls Together with them, I fought…and fought… and fought my heart out By utilizing this power, we could readily confront the Soul Reapers I realized that with this power, we could create a paradise for Bounts But the attitude of other Bounts towards me gradually changed And when I realized it, I was alone Even so, I stayed with my comrades Until that time… On that day, the Bounts had decided to use the strength of the Quincies… – …to go to Soul Society – What are you saying! Stop! It’s already decided Going to Soul Society means… you’re clinging to the Soul Reapers! We don’t have to do that! We can create our own paradise in this world with our own strength! The existence of Bounts in this world is abnormal Even if we use our power to build a place for ourselves, it is doomed to eventually fail It’s better that we return to our original place For Bounts, Soul Society is the paradise Not one of them listened to my pleas And the fighting began… But, in the end, the Soul Reapers hindered this plan Unable to find a meaning to this battle I got hit from a blast and was injured, and before I could do a thing, the battle was over I gave up on the weak Bounts But…I couldn’t forgive the Soul Reapers from Soul Society! I gathered the strong Bounts who survived and swore to destroy Soul Society Activating the dolls used to come accidentally… so I set out to refine and perfect its use and began classifying the Bounts In that process, many Bounts lost their lives But the ones remaining were truly committed to attaining strength And I rose, in order to destroy Soul Society To think I had forgotten all about you who had given us false hope and eternal suffering I wonder if it’s due to the power of the Jokai Crest But it’s over For the weak Bounts who clung to your words For Soul Society who used us mercilessly I will turn everything into nothing! You are…the Quincy! Kariya, your opponent is me! Kid… What can you possibly do now! What! Amazing That Quincy has completely mastered that artifact What’s the meaning of this Didn’t you reach your limit with that thing in the battle with Yoshi This ancient artifact amasses reishi quickly, and multiplies it in order to assist a Quincy with weak spiritual powers Simply put, it accumulates reishi even if the wielder does nothing Until now, all I did was attack and adjust the outgoing power Doing just that is sure to make it reach its limit Unable to handle the load of reishi, it would eventually discharge spontaneously However, there’s another method This artifact can be used solely as an amplifier with me using my own power to adjust and control the reishi Then the stress on the accessory itself is lessened and I can still battle, even in this state Extreme battle conditions made me realize this He mentioned that he uses that artifact because he lost his own spiritual power But to be able to do this much in such a condition is… What’s so funny! With so much power, why do you side with the Soul Reapers Aren’t Soul Reapers enemies to the Quincies Don’t get the wrong idea I am not an ally of Soul Reapers I’m here to stop this senseless fight Humph… Such noble words Yoshino lost her life in order to bring you down She said, “Kariya hates not only Soul Reapers, but Bounts too” “Someday, his all consuming hatred will end up destroying the Bounts too” Yoshino understood that what you were doing was totally meaningless to the Bounts But in the end, no one was able to stop you Perhaps it’s all too late Still…I will stop you! I wonder if you can I will! It’s over! Don’t underestimate me! The quality of the reishi in Seireitei is much higher than that in the Rukon District As long as I have this power, your attacks are useless! A crack in the artifact! It seems the stress placed on that bow isn’t completely erased No problem I just have to bring you down before this bow breaks Can you do it I have all the reishi within the Seireitei Same here In order to release a powerful arrow, you need to have some aim And on the other hand, it doesn’t have much power for any other kind of attack And it seems you don’t have much time left If things keep going like this… What’s the matter Your attacks are becoming crude! This is it, Quincy! Kariya! What! Wh-What is this Spiritual Pressure! Why you…! Rantao! Now! Shoot now! Why you--! Hurry! But…! Never mind me! Shoot! Right now, I’m momentarily intercepting the power of the Jokai Crest as an intermediary to increase my Spiritual Pressure! I cannot continue this for long! There’s no way I can do such a thing! Shoot! Don’t let this Bount add more… to his sins! Yes, that’s the way Why you--! Let go! Rantao! Rantao! What about Kariya He’s still alive You…purposely lessened the force Don’t worry, I’m going to inflict the final blow right now No! This is…her Spiritual Pressure is going out of control! Is it a reaction to the earlier power No… If I don’t do something, Rantao’s body will disintegrate and… That’s it! This artifact controls reishi… Rantao! Hang on! I can use this artifact… to remove the spirit energy that’s going out of control inside you! You…mustn’t do that! Your artifact is nearing its limit The remaining power… must be used to destroy Kariya Never mind me! I used this power fully prepared for this So…! Rantao! So hurry! Otherwise, Kariya will recover Now… Now is your only chance! Wh-Why you--! Quincy! Rantao! I can’t let you die like this! Quincy… I’ve reached my limit We can’t stay here Let’s go somewhere safe Do you think you can run away It seems you’ve lost the perfect chance to kill me You managed to escape death, but this is it Die!

" I want to live in a world of peace Without conflict, like the one I dreamed of I cant be patient any longer There are things I must say At the evening bus stop on the way home I Wave to those sunken shoulders, Bye Bye Bye Got to show your Fighting Pose, Oh! Oh! That world I dreamed of Is peaceful every day, without any conflict But in reality, there are troubles every day And sometimes I regret, these Rolling days Lies probably have little meaning ~All my loving Otherwise, how can I go on A Sweet Love I dreamed of Where lovers search for a hideaway But in reality, the days we cant meet Go on; but we still believe, these Rolling days We may stumble, but Way to go!! Yeah!! Yeah!! A mud-caked Rolling star!! This is…  Her Spiritual Pressure is going out of control! Rantao! Hang on! I can use this artifact to remove the spirit energy thats going out of control inside you! Ive reached my limit Its not safe here! Lets go somewhere safe! Do you think you can get away! You managed to escape death, but this is it Die! Looks like you’re in a bind Kurosaki! Brat! Ishida, are you all right You dont need to worry about me… What about you, Rantao Im all right… Ishida, take Rantao and get away from here… Sorry, but Im going to take on Kariya! It seems like thats our only choice… Yeah… Bankai!! Here I go! Stop! Getsugatensho! Are you all right Thank you… Ishida! Inoue… Thank goodness… Youre safe… Huh What happened to your artifact It broke… It broke Wasnt it supposed to explode if it broke Yeah… As I reached my limit, I realized how to use the artifact for just amplifying reishi… That way, it wouldnt explode when I surpassed my limit because it was already empty I see… Did you understand that Not at all! It doesnt matter as long as hes safe! But listen! Stop going off on your own! Everyone was worried about you! Okay…sorry… Are they there! Yeah, theyre all right! Wheres Ichigo Kurosaki Hes fighting Kariya Captain! Yeah I know We cant let Ichigo Kurosaki handle this burden on his own Were going, too Wait! Who are you Oh… This is Rantao… Rantao! The exiled engineer, huh She created the Bounts Youre a Thirteen Court Guard Squads Captain, arent you Yeah… I want you to do something for me… At this rate, Seireitei will be finished! Huh What do you mean You know that Kariya has absorbed the Jokai Crest into his body, dont you Yeah… Weve already researched that The Jokai Crest is definitely powerful… But hell need time in order to use its full power In other words, hes probably buying himself time right now… Yes… But the Jokai Crest power thats in Kariya isnt a big deal Theres a different power we need to worry about… A different power “Jokai Crest” is the general term for giant reishi-generating devices we used to use There were probably, at least, several dozen within Seireitei One day, a Jokai Crest went out of control during an experiment… When it exploded, it annihilated about a tenth of Seireitei… The leaders at the time took this very seriously and sealed away all of the Jokai Crests that were in Seireitei What! Theres more than one! If Kariya blows up the Jokai Crest that hes absorbed into his body… It would probably set off all the other Jokai Crests… That is Kariyas true goal If all of the Jokai Crests explode, their destructive force would be unfathomable… Why are such things in Seireitei! Because theyre dangerous, and dangerous things need to be kept in sight! I see… “People often know little of…” whats happening in their own backyards,” right! Not quite… What should we do We just have to seal each Jokai Crest with kido once more Many years have passed, and their current seals have weakened Theyll react to Kariyas explosion Captain! All right… Well arrange to have them re-sealed immediately Do you know where the Jokai Crests are Here is… Rantao! Im all right… I told you before, didnt I Im fighting with my Spiritual Pressure sealed away Im overextending myself… Ive just reached the limit to which I can be active… Sorry, but I leave the rest to you… Matsumoto, lets go! Yes! What will you be doing We… Were going after Kurosaki! Kurosaki is fighting We cant just run away Besides, Ive got to heal Kurosakis wounds! Inoue… Ishida, let me carry Rantao Lets go once weve taken Rantao somewhere she can rest Thank you, Sado All right, now that its decided, lets go! Were finally drawing towards the conclusion! Lets see this to the end Everyone… All right! Lets go after Kurosaki! I commend you for keeping up with me this far… I told you… Im going to settle this! Do you know what kind of place this is Yeah I know Far better than you… This place is perfect for settling this Yeah… Flash and Burst! Nijigasumi! Youre… SEIREITEI LIBRARY What! Rantao gave us this Its a copy of a map that shows where the Jokai Crest seals are My, my… After all that’s happened, who would have thought that there was still such a thing left It seems that we stayed up all night for nothing… Captain! Nows not the time to be saying that! Have you told the General Captain Ive sent Matsumoto to see him We should get some orders soon… Whatever the case, to seal this many Jokai Crests, we need to mobilize all of our remaining captains, lieutenants, and high-ranking officers… Whatll we do about Kariya Ichigo Kurosakis gone after him Captains, lieutenants, and squad members of all ranks of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads, this is an urgent report! The ryoka are after an ancient item known as a Jokai Crest Weve confirmed the existence of several The Jokai Crests need to be sealed away immediately Issuing a level one precautionary warning! Everyone is to head to a Jokai Crest seal! We shall use hell butterflies to lead you there You too, Lieutenant Matsumoto Go to a Jokai Crest seal Yes! Given the nature of the circumstances… I shall directly lead everything Captain Komamura, assist me Understood Excuse me It seems like the fight on Sokyoku Hill has begun Yeah! All of the Soul Reapers in Seireitei have been mobilized… It seems that Ichigo Kurosaki is the one fighting the ryoka… We should start preparing to evacuate Lets ask Lord Byakuya for instructions Yes… Ichigo… Youre still alive! Master Kariya… Theres something I want to ask you What is it Where are Koga and the others They died Died Yeah… They all died Is that so… Hey, what are you doing Stop! I said, “Stop!” I cant do that! What are you doing Youre all worn out… What are you doing, Ichinose If you… If you told me to destroy Seireitei, I would have no choice but to do so… I have abandoned this place… My heart would not hurt if it disappeared Thats what I thought… I saw my respected captain in you… Thats why I served by your side But… Weve come to serve justice Why do you stand before us! How stupid! Is that really your goal Relying on people and loyalty are different things Dont talk as if you understand! Come on! Kenpachi Zaraki!! During my battle with Zaraki, I remembered something I had forgotten… I wanted to turn the Thirteen Court Guard Squads… Seireitei into something even slightly better than what it is… That was my wish… My captain and I wanted the same world… Thats why I worked my hardest by my captains side My ideal will not change even if he is gone But the emptiness of my captains death changed my desires into revenge Master Kariya… Youve gained the power to change Soul Society I shall kneel before you once more if you will use your power to rebuild Seireitei… But… If…If you will only use it for revenge… I will stop you! Nothing can be born of revenge Now that Koga and the other Bounts are dead, the only one who can stop you is me! Master Kariya… Ichinose… I cant do that Youre not getting away! You cant stop me with your power Thanks for all your help… Thanks to you, youve allowed me time for the Jokai Crests power to spread through my body… Kari…ya! Kariya! You bastard… Do you know what you just did What are you trying to say You killed your comrade! He served by your side… What about it “What about it”! He was your enemy… Why do you pity him I dont pity him! But Im saying that I cant forgive you for killing your comrade so coldly I never thought of them as comrades They were pawns I used to achieve my goal You bastard! Im going to settle this with you now Zeige Dih, Messer! Wh-Whats this! What is that What fierce wind! And I can sense Kariyas Spiritual Pressure rising rapidly! Lets hurry! I didnt think there was a need to show you my doll… But it seems Im almost out of time This is my doll, Messer! You cant come near me anymore! Youve sure got confidence What are you doing Renji… Why are you here I couldnt find my captain, so I came for him directly Anyway, you… Renji… I want you to do something for me What is it Take me to the Sokyoku… You… You always lament on how boring this town is …Searching for a place in the sun The melody you hum is that rusty, same old song …Rejecting any new song Youre anxious because somewhere in your heart, you believe in the future Baby, its you; That pain will eventually become a memory Youre the only one Dont think, just feel, let your whole body tremble; future is you!! Baby, its me; Youre never alone, Im right here We should be as one; Even if you stumble, I don’t mind I want to tell you now about the thing called love Soon Soon Ill be filled with the Jokai Crests power and I will wipe Seireitei from this world Theres nothing anyone can do to stop me anymore! Kariya… Ill stop you! I wont let you destroy this world! The Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers Golden after these messages!! – Illustrated guide to Soul Reapers! – Golden! Here Yeah Kurosaki and the others should be resting here Everyone sure has it hard… All right, Ill use my soothing powers… I have a message – The Substitute Soul Reaper has… – No… – …begun fighting the Bount – You cant… – Return to your command posts – You cant… – All right – You cant touch that… Stop… Hey, everyone!

Yeah!! Yeah!! A mud-caked Rolling star!! I see… You reduced the damage done to you by releasing all of your Spiritual Pressure and surrounding yourself with it I’m finally starting to get your attacks… So… Counterattacks are aimed at the openings that enemies leave when they attack… What good is that if I dont provide any openings Defending yourself with Spiritual Pressure, huh My, my… Im not used to this… My coat is all in tatters I see… It really does seem to minimize the damage done to one’s body My attacks are only counter strikes! In that case, Ill show you… Messers true form! Thats… My power is wind Wind can generate static electricity through atmospheric friction… …and create lightning! Its useless! No matter how fast you move… You can’t outrun lightning! I got you! Whats wrong Is that it You bastard… Fine… Im going to finish this Soon, the Jokai Crest within me will fill up with power I never told you this, but theres more than one Jokai Crest What! If I unleash my Jokai Crest, itll trigger all of the Jokai Crests, and Seireitei will be reduced to nothing Why would you do such a thing! Whats the point of killing your comrades, the Soul Reapers and yourself! The Bounts are a rotten tribe They were given so much power but they wouldn’t let go of their ties to the Soul Reapers And the Soul Reapers are even more rotten They selfishly created the Bounts and used them for their own purposes I couldnt forgive any of that I will drag all of them down with me Soul Reapers, souls… Im going to destroy them all! Are you crazy! Im completely sane The world is the one thats crazy But thats enough… Soon, this world is going to end What are you talking about! I wont let you…do that! Ichigo! Wait! Let go of me, Renji! This is Ichigos battle! Dont interfere! But… Hes proved to be Captain Kuchikis equal in combat… Believe in him! Im not going to let you destroy everything! My, my… What can you do in your condition Shut up! Just a little longer and everything will end Oh well Ill finish you off before the world ends Crap! I dont have any energy! I cant move my arm… Move… Move… Move! Itll move Ichigo… A black Getsugatensho… Wh-Where did you get that power! Thats your inner power, huh But it seems even that power has dried up I have a powerful ally known as reishi… I cant absorb it! Why Why cant I absorb reishi anymore! Can it be…! She did that so I couldnt absorb reishi, huh Youve done it, Rantao… It looks like youre not invincible anymore Were on equal terms now! Its a little late… What! The time is near… Just a little longer… Just a little longer and Ill be filled with the Jokai Crests power At that moment, Ill unleash the Jokai Crest and everything will be over I wont let you! Ill defeat you before you unleash the Jokai Crest! Can you do that! I will! In that case, Ill show you how incredible the Jokai Crests power is! What! Im going to detonate one of the Jokai Crests nearby All right, its here! Sentaro, take care of it! Yes sir! Captain! Yes… The information that Rantao gave us was right Seal this up quickly! Yes! Theres no time… I hope we make it! There are too many locations Who knows how much time itll take to seal all of them Silence! I wont listen to such nonsense! It is the duty of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads to defend Seireitei! We will do everything in our power to stop the ryokas plan! Youre going to detonate a Jokai Crest Dont worry Detonating one of the Jokai Crests placed within the court wont affect the others Now learn the power of the Jokai Crest! Bankai, Senbonzakura Kageyoshi What! Byakuya… You bastard! It looks like I made it in time… Yoruichi! Sorry, sorry… It looks like Im late Ichigo! Right now, Ukitake and all the other Soul Reapers are sealing the Jokai Crests in Seireitei Huh! But its taking time… Will they be sealed Will the Jokai Crests be activated… Or will I defeat him, huh I get it! Whatever the case, its a race against time… What are you going to do, Kariya Its obvious… Im going to defeat all of you and accomplish my goal! Im your opponent! You bastard! Dont do it, Byakuya When he unleashes his Jokai Crest, we have to seal it away with my Shunko and your Senbonzakura! Well be too late if we’re fighting him as well… Though I dont know if we can completely seal it away Is that all your power can do Shut up… Damn! I used up too much power compressing the Jokai Crest I guess it cant be helped… This is odd Kariya cant absorb reishi anymore, but his attacks arent getting any weaker… No… Instead it seems like theyre getting stronger… Why… I see! Ichigo! Just a little more! Hes already out of spiritual power! Right now, hes fighting using the power of the Jokai Crest in his body! What about it How silly This is a gamble… The Jokai Crest will activate in just a little while Will my body hold up… or will you defeat me Heh! I told you that from the start! Im going to defeat you! I will! What can you do when youre panting like that Whats wrong Are you finished I wont hold back anymore! Can you handle this! Thats… Ichinoses zanpakuto… Over here! Hes over here! What happened to the ground! Is Ichigo all right Kurosaki! Everyone… Kuchiki! Renji! Ichigo! Kurosaki! Abarai, Sado, help Kurosaki! We cant interfere No… We shouldnt interfere… Kuchiki… He probably considers the Bounts similar to himself… Ichigo is a Substitute Soul Reaper, but he isnt a Soul Reaper Hes human, but not a normal human Until he gained his Soul Reaper powers, Ichigo wanted the power to protect those close to him… He got the power he wanted, and from that point on he was burdened with two worlds – the World of the Living and Soul Society He has a burden we cannot understand… But Ichigo bears this burden and tries to move forward… Could we do the same thing Bounts are also people who are not people… They suffered in two worlds… Kariya can only be stopped by Ichigo He bears the same burden Then…the only thing we can do is to trust him and watch Dont worry Hell win! Yeah… Youre right This is it! Im going to hit you with all that’s left of my strength! Then Im going to settle this, too Lets go! The Jokai Crest is backed by all of the Bounts! Can you withstand it, Ichigo Kurosaki! And what have you ever done for the Bounts! Youre the one who treated your comrades as pawns! I wont lose to someone like you! What do you know People hate those who are superior to themselves Your friends arent any different! Over time, friends who you trusted will come to fear your power and distance themselves from you Whats the point in protecting them! There is meaning! There’s no reason to it! I protect them because I want to! Id risk my soul! Your soul No! Hes activated it! Byakuya! Were going to seal it! Byakuya! Whats wrong! At this rate hes going to unleash it! Byakuya! Nothing matters anymore! Im going to end everything now! Kariya! It looks like its over… Im a little disappointed I wont get to see whether you walk down the same path that I have… Kurosaki… I… You idiot… Chad! Are you all right, Ichigo… Kurosaki! Ichigo! Kurosaki! Everyone… Ichigo! Ichigo… I was so worried about you – Ichi…Ichigo… – Kurosaki! Ive got to heal your wounds! No You can do that later In the end, he disappeared on his own Are you saying that he was planning  to do that from the beginning Who knows But he probably wanted to bring  his never-ending life to an end You always lament on how boring this town is …Searching for a place in the sun The melody you hum is that rusty, same old song …Rejecting any new song Youre anxious because somewhere in your heart, you believe in the future Baby, its you; That pain will eventually become a memory Youre the only one Dont think, just feel, let your whole body tremble; future is you!!

Ive finished  sealing a Jokai Crest! Captain! I sealed away three! Correction! I sealed away ten! Actually, it was fifty! -Kuchiki, were there -It really was 100! -that many -Actually, it was 200! -Captain, dont take them seriously  -No, no, it was 300!  Sorry, but hide me for a while!

Yeah!! Yeah!! A mud-caked Rolling star!! Are you better now Renji… Yeah… Inoue completely fixed me up Well, you dont seem like youd die even if you were killed Shut up Inoue healed Rukia as well, right Shes taking pretty long to recover… Idiot… Did you forget Her current injuries arent the only reason why shes been weakened Rukia didnt have enough time to recover her spiritual power when the Bount mayhem occurred, and she was sent to the World of the Living She needs time to recover I see… So are you finished cleaning up Yeah… Damaged buildings need to be repaired and the wounded need to be healed There is still damage, but it looks like were pretty much finished It seems that Seireitei has officially acknowledged the Bounts’ existence and the reason for their creation Yeah… That bastard, Kariya, wanted to erase the Bounts existence, but instead, he left a big impression As usual, you talk as if you know everything… What! Come on… This happened because you sent the Bounts here! What! You were with us, too! I… I defeated Gesell, remember! Zabimaru is still damaged because of that! Isnt that because youre weak What…did you say! Dont get so mad! I just let the truth slip! You just let what slip! Dont get cocky just because you got a little better! Besides, youre just a substitute Youre not like a real Soul Reaper! Dont get carried away! Got it! I said Im sorry! No! I cant forgive you! Shut up! Im worn out! Your strange meekness is even more unforgivable! What are you doing – Umm… – Umm… Youre pretty noisy You havent forgotten where you are, have you Sorry… Ichigo Kurosaki If your business here is done, go back to the World of the Living immediately You do not belong here I got scolded because of you! Did he come out after he was done eavesdropping on our conversation Shut up… You fools! Hey, youre up Of course! I cant get any sleep with you guys raising a ruckus! You two don’t think of me as an injured patient, do you! How peaceful Yeah… But man… I never thought that I would come to this world twice You meddle too much! Yeah Probably… Whats this Say something! There arent any Bounts left… It was a battle that left such unimaginable suffering Yeah… Kariya… was too hung up about the Bounts past He probably couldnt stand things repeating themselves over and over again Repeating Yeah… Its not easy living forever… He saw the state of the Bounts get worse countless times over a thousand years To him, history wasnt a line that stretched forward It was something that revolved around and around in a circle He wanted to break that cycle Revolving, huh It’s revolving Im being transferred No, no! Were not transferring you or anything extreme like that! Youre being stationed in the World of the Living! You went there to support me when you joined long ago! Over there! Umm… Look, she doesnt remember! She erased it from her memory because it was such a bad experience! Right, Kuchiki! Umm… Huh! Shut up! Go bury yourself in the yard! What! Im not some potted plant! Umm… Youre being stationed within a four-kilometer radius around Karakura Town With your skills, this mission shouldnt be difficult Captain Ukitake! C-Captain! Thats no good Youve got to get some rest! No… Im feeling good today Even though its only a month, I thought you might be anxious being stationed by yourself for the first time I came to see you off Thank you very much! Dont That sounds so stiff Have you informed Byakuya Oh! No… Not yet… Oh… No… Captain Kuchiki would probably tell me not to inform him about every little thing… So I was going to leave without informing him… I see… All right Thats fine if you think so Ill tell Byakuya Go with peace of mind! Yes! Thats right… That was the beginning of everything Until I met Ichigo, I thought that the future was a line that stretched on forever I still believe that I hereby appoint Squad 11 Sixth Seat Renji Abarai to the position of Squad 6 lieutenant Congratulations, Abarai! Y-Yeah! Oh, no… I humbly accept this appointment, Lieutenant Hinamori! You dont have to do that That sounds so rigid… Anyway…arent you glad Youve gotten one step closer to Byakuya Kuchiki Ikkaku… Isnt it about time you talk to Rukia Even if shes become an aristocrat, youre a lieutenant Youre more than equals You held out for 40 years Its about time you restore your relationship with her Before, you used to run around the Rukon District together In that case… You should hurry Kuchiki is supposed to be stationed in the World of the Living for a month Oh no! Abarai, hurry! No… Ill be officially promoted at the appointment ceremony a month from now When she comes back, Ill surprise her by telling her that Im a lieutenant It’s revolving If fate is a cog, then all we can do is believe that whatever is turning it is flawless, as we move ahead… in the direction of the force of the fixed cogs Then…a blade is swung And so fell the sword of fate… Where am I Youve regained consciousness Youre…Yoshino! Shes not Yoshino… Shes Rantao… Rantao… This is Rantaos hideout Why am I here I carried you here, so the Soul Reapers wouldnt find you Werent you with Ichigo Kurosaki and the others Why did you help me Who knows… What about Kariya He died I see The Jokai Crest is backed by all of the Bounts! Can you withstand it, Ichigo Kurosaki! People hate those who are superior to themselves Your friends arent any different! I protect them because I want to! Id risk my soul! Kariya! If the fate of the Bounts is to die out… then I just have to accept that I see Anyway, you should stay here until your wounds heal Rantao… I no longer have anything to do… I dont plan on returning to Seireitei after all this time I want to listen to the story of the last Bount… Well then, Im returning to the World of the Living Ive left the rest to Ukitake Theres no need to worry Sorry, but… What is it Thank Ichigo Kurosaki for me for stopping Kariya All right Ill tell him… Huh All right! No ones noticed me! Here I go! What are you doing O-Oh Its just you! Dont surprise me, you bastard! You bastard… You were trying to sneak into Rukias room Whats wrong with me wanting to be with her! She and I are of one mind and body! Ive devoted myself to her! Just what in the world are you talking about Youll be sliced up by Byakuyas Senbonzakura if you go in there Shut up! Besides, you guys neglect me way too much! By the time I finally caught up to you, everything was over and I lost my chance to play an active role! An active role You wanted to be useful Why do you think I came to this world! All right… I understand Lets go! The Senkaimon is just about ready What! What about Sister Shes injured, so she has to stay here to recover, of course What! Then Im going to stay by her side! Let go of me, Ichigo! Theres no point in leaving you here! Crap! If only I were more powerful… I could pound the Bounts and the Soul Reapers… and make Sister adore me Power, huh He gained that power and was swung around by it In the end, he had to destroy himself Kariya wanted the power to change fate What I wanted was… Revolving… Ichigo! Did you see! Did you see this! Its the new Bad Shield Series! Bad… What is that What! Hey, hey, hey! You said before that you enjoyed watching the DVD of the TV version! I forgot What! I like this series! Shut up! I wasnt talking to you, Mizuiro! Its cool, isnt it! I like Stanley Ashford… – It doesnt just revolve – …the guy who plays Ricky! – It revolves…and whenever… – Julian, who plays Mille… – the sun touches the moon… – is a much better actor – It seems that Mille dies in “2” – Really! …the world changes itself into something new Umm… Then whats your favorite snack Gotsubukko No way! Then you like baumkuchen as well, dont you Oh, yeah, I do! Okay! Heres what your fortune says…! Youre a perfect match… for me--! Youre leading her on with those questions! Hey, what are you doing! Huh! Later, Tatsuki! Oh! Im going home soon, too Sorry, I have somewhere I need to go! I see… Then see you tomorrow! If there is something that doesnt change… Im sure it would be my helplessness Ah… So, boy, you really came… Sorry… She disappeared Yeah I can see spirits I can touch them I can talk to them But thats it That airplane… Its gone to waste Thats all right… It was just something in my closet Sometimes they just disappear like this I dont know why they disappear Sometimes they leave behind bloodstains that only I can see and somewhat painful feelings No matter how much I train my body, I cant protect them Whenever I think about it, my heart feels like a blade It’s revolving Oh! Mister! Over here! Sorry! Im late… Three dogs and six cats passed me by today! I see… Did they say anything The brown dog was really cheeky! He kept peeing on the telephone pole, no matter how many times I told him not to! Look! I brought you flowers! Wow! Theyre beautiful! There we go! Huh Whats wrong Will you come back tomorrow It’s revolving… Yeah, all right! – If fate is a cog wheel… – Ill come back tomorrow! – We are… – Thank you…mister… grains of sand crushed between those cogs Its all right Dont cry anymore! – There is nothing we can do – Got it! We just want power If it’s something we can’t easily protect, we want to grab a sword beforehand The power to crush fate surely resembles a swinging blade Is my strength the power to crush fate Or will I be consumed by my power like Kariya was Theres no point in thinking about it… This power is for protecting everyone! Thats fine, isnt it Whats wrong, Ichigo Ukitake… Why are you spacing out Well, I was thinking about why Kariya wanted to gain power Kariya probably thought of history as a circle He was probably trying to sever it with force… I dont know if thats right or wrong… But…even if things repeated themselves… It wouldnt be that bad if you had friends there…right Its not something that can be answered so easily Is history something that revolves or stretches ahead of us Even if its something that revolves, should we try to break that loop… Or be content with it Ichigo, everyones here! Kurosaki-kun! Ichigo! We came all this way to this unknown world, Soul Society… It truly is sad, but its almost time to part You can stay if you want to Youre being mean again! Its almost time Let’s go home, Ichigo Yeah… Revolving, huh Thank you, Ichigo Lets meet again… We tremble in awe of that which cannot be seen Whats this Such a cruddy little town And so fell the sword of fate once again in the name of a mask You always lament on how boring this town is …Searching for a place in the sun The melody you hum is that rusty, same old song …Rejecting any new song Youre anxious because somewhere in your heart, you believe in the future Baby, its you; That pain will eventually become a memory Youre the only one Dont think, just feel, let your whole body tremble; future is you!! Baby, its me; Youre never alone, Im right here We should be as one; Even if you stumble, I don’t mind I want to tell you now about the thing called love Hey, howve you all been! Its Kon! I didnt appear much in Soul Society, but Ill play a big part when we get back to the World of the Living Sorry But with the new main character of Bleach, me, appearing in the next episode, you don’t have any appearances Who the hell are you! My name is… Oh! The Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers Golden after these messages! Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! Im back… Hey! We just got back! You sure are late, Captain Yeah, we got lost in Kusajishi… It was really fun! So where are the Bounts Ichigo defeated them I see… All right! I guess Ill fight Ichigo now! Captain… He already returned to the World of the Living What! That bastard… When I see him again, Ill kill him without even greeting him! Ichigo… You were right not to see him before you left Dont spy on others!"

Finally, and this is most important… Anyone who meets a ryoka is to kill him without hesitation! Hey! Its coming this way! Have any of the squads left yet Lieutenant Omaeda of Squad 2 left with some squad members! Any others Squad 7’s Lieutenant Iba also headed to the Rukon District! All right! Keep gathering information! Well gather all reports from all the squads! Dont let any information leak! Yes! It sure is quiet… Well, itll get loud soon… There they are! Im first! No, Im first! Youre taking us on in broad daylight Youve got some guts… Kariya, can you leave this to me Yeah, this is perfect… Test it out Zeig dih, Dalk! Hi! How are you! Oh my The air here is delicious… It feels good! Oh Bounts sure use strange techniques… Humph You wimp! Cant you fight with your own power! That bastard is absorbing reishi! Who are you! Dont look at me as if Im some monster… Im still human Just better than your average human Get him! Dalk, crush them! All right! Im feeling really good too! Hey! How dare you underestimate us! Hey! Isnt there anyone else! Ive become really strong! Someone, save me! Thats no good… Its just a waste of your strength… Omaeda! I dont like attacking people who are unarmed, but I have no choice! What! You call yourself a Soul Reaper Know…your place! How do you feel This is great… Theres an unlimited amount of highly pure reishi here I see… Then lets go… Call the Med Crew! Yes! Everyone else, to defensive positions Ascertain the extent of the damage! Lieutenant Omaeda! Get a hold of yourself! Captain Hitsugaya! Its Squad 7s Lieutenant Iba! Is he all right Thankfully hes conscious! Captain! Sorry Im late Ive just returned Matsumoto… Im very sorry… I couldnt complete my mission I allowed the ryoka to invade Soul Society… Im the one who dispatched you… Im responsible Dont worry about it… Yes… What have you found out I dont have anything to report… But…It is difficult to pinpoint the location of the Bounts Even now, the only Spiritual Pressure that could be detected was that of the two Lieutenants… Tsk--! This is troublesome… We will continue the investigation! Yes! Matsumoto, welcome back to the squad! Yes! Were back again… Yes… Did you sense that Spiritual Pressure earlier Yeah, it seemed like some Soul Reaper was fighting the Bounts But you didnt sense the Bounts Spiritual Pressure, did you Its the same as the World of the Living, huh Why are you in deep thought This is an emergency situation… Thats right! That shot of both of you from behind Ugh…how disgusting! Youre not lovers! What are you talking about, Lirin! Humph! I dont know why, but it feels bad! Now now, calm down Well lose to the Bounts if we fight! Thats right I dont care! Kurosaki! Kuchiki! Bad news, bad news! Whats wrong She moved Huh Kukaku loves to move, as usual… Yoruichi, do you know where she moved to I think I have a feeling where she might be… There she is! We finally found her! How nostalgic… You think so Yeah… Thats odd… She always changes its design when she moves, but… As usual, she displays her complete lack of aesthetic vision… Just like your pictures… Silence! Ow! This is usually Kons role… Hm Where did Kon go off to Huh! Wha-! Come to think of it, he isnt here… Thats odd… I was sure he came with us to this world… What Kon is lost What should we do Should we search for him Well, hell be all right! Hes bursting with energy! Yes Thats right This voice! Ichigo--! Sister--! What is this! We came all this way to the ends of the earth! Who got lost! Me! Crap! This place has been sealed! You cant enter! Whats this Hello What happened Whats this! Theres a strange small animal! Huh! Huh! This has got to be a monster! Y-Youre mistaken! Im a Mod Soul… Whats that That strange small animal has got to be the one that destroyed this house! I-I wouldnt do that! Or rather, I cant do that! Catch him! I wont die here! Im going to live! Im going to live! I wont lose! GUY BURSTING WITH ENERGY You idiot! It hurts, it hurts! Yoruichi told me that there was something strange… happening in the World of the Living So I dispatched you there because I thought you could be of some use to her! Its just like you said! And you say you forgot because you were occupied with your job at the convenience store Are you kidding me! Youre the same as always… Sorry, I couldnt be of any help… You know what convenience stores are Is that a problem Huh Bastard… You were making fun of me! No, I wasnt… Im in a really bad mood right now! Ichigo, dont say unnecessary things! Wh-What did I say! Im going to straighten you both out! Get over here! Kukaku… Your mouth can get you into trouble… And The man called Kariya, the leader of the Bounts… said that he was going to have revenge on Soul Society… The old Department of Research and Development created them… Despite that, there is almost no record of them in Soul Society… What do you mean! “Put a lid on anything that stinks…” That’s what probably happened… I dont know how the Bounts are going to get their revenge… But you probably already know that it wont be easy to get into Seireitei since its surrounded by a wall… So you want to investigate what they are thinking and what theyre doing Yeah Sorry… I know that there are a lot of people, but for the time being, could you let us stay here The Rukon District is big But itll be somewhat easy to move if we stay here Koganehiko! Shiroganehiko! Are we good with food With our body and soul put into it…! We can feed up to thirty people! All right… In a way, the Bounts were allowed to invade… because of my stupid younger brothers mismanagement… Wh-Why! Big Sis, I didnt… Yes… Its all my fault… Its a cramped house, but use it as you like! By the way, how are you going to find these Bounts – Tada! – Tada! Leave that to us! What are these strange things Theyre Mod Souls that Urahara created to detect the Bounts Spiritual Pressure Ooh… Mod Souls, huh! I never would have thought of putting them in a doll… I expected Urahara to do something interesting No…well… Thats not something to be surprised about! One more thing… I have something to ask of everyone… What is it Could you collect information on someone called Rantao Rantao Whos that Yeah… Ichigo… Kariya told you about the history of the Bounts’ appearance, didnt he The lead researcher who created the Bounts long ago Thats Rantao What! Are you saying that this person called Rantao is still alive! Yes… Its been more than 1,000 years since he was expelled from Seireitei… But its been rumored that he lives in the depths of Rukon District… All right! Then we may be able to learn something about the Bounts if we meet this guy Yeah… All right! Then lets have dinner! Koganehiko! Shiroganehiko! Youre ready arent you! Yes! This way to the dining room! Come to think of it, I havent eaten anything for a while Im hungry Sorry for the trouble Yoruichi… What is it Do you have anything else to tell me About what Dont play dumb… Tell me everything you know Why aren’t you going to Seireitei Its not just because its convenient here, is it Theres a Soul Reaper whos aiding the Bounts… He not only has the ability to hide his Spiritual Pressure… But he has the power to turn invisible Hes already broken into Seireitei Oh Theres no mistake in assuming that this Soul Reaper, Ichinose, sealed the database… of the archives in the Department of Research and Development And he probably manipulated the data… so Mayuri Kurotsuchi would become interested in the Bounts… Kurotsuchi fell for a simple trick… He prepared the Quincy power and called the Bounts to Soul Society… I see… In other words… Youve chosen to hide somewhere where that guy, Ichinose, cant predict your movements… Soi Fon is secretly strengthening Seireiteis security, but… Taking into consideration everything that happened… It would probably be difficult to stop him from breaking in Probably… Also, Im someone who once left Soul Society… Its too much of a pain to enter Seireitei after all this time… If anything, Id say thats the real reason… Im just going to do things my way… Can we win I dont know… Well, thats fine I love trouble! KUKAKU SHIBA Ill help you out! Thanks… Well split up from here Use Lirin, Kurodo, and Noba to search for the Bounts Whoever finds them will inform everyone with weak Spiritual Pressure Is that clear! Yes Rukia, what are you going to do Now that Ive returned, I have to return to my own squad Im quite late, but Im going now I see All right Dont do anything rash, Ichigo… Yeah… How silly! Huh Im going to find the Bounts first! Im not going to lose to the likes of… to the likes of Rukia! I wont lose! Whats…with her This is a form of jealousy… Yeah… Jeez, I dont know what shes thinking… Of who No, well… Hey, Ishida! Theres no time to waste Ill search for them by myself Leave me alone for a moment… Ishida! Im all right… All right, Kurodo! Yes! Take care of Inoue! Just leave it to me! Inoue, dont push yourself too much I know All right! Lets go! The dustiness of Rukon District hasnt changed at all… Aw…jeez! Why am I so pissed off! Im so pissed off about being pissed! Jeez!

I-Its begun! Here we go! She got me! Im going to get you back! What! Oh, Rukia! In your current state, youre no match for her! Why dont you run away! You cannot defeat me!

We were able to learn new information concerning the Bounts from old documents owned by the Kuchiki family Therefore, I shall report it here Oh At one time… There were many experiments performed here in Seireitei which are now forbidden… It was well before the establishment of the Department of Research and Development… Rantao, a scientist known as the Evil Researcher, became the leader of these experiments The experiments involved eternal life But an unexpected accident happened… that affected a portion of souls in the cycle of rebirth A mutated strain of humans with abnormal abilities were born in the World of the Living… Those are the Bounts… And after the accident, Rantao took responsibility and was banished from Seireitei The Bounts were purged so as not to cause harm to the World of the Living… Cause harm to the World of the Living, huh Well… It sounds as if some superior wanted to conceal this in order to defend his own interests Kyoraku! It doesnt matter… Whatever the case, this is the result of what we have created… It seems the Bounts really came to Soul Society for revenge… But… Whatever their reasons, we must annihilate the Bounts In regards to this event, at the moment… Soul Reaper substitute Ichigo Kurosaki has entered Soul Society from the World of the Living Well now… He sure works hard… Ive come to inform you! Just now, Bount waves and Squad 13s Rukia Kuchikis Spiritual Pressure have been detected! Open the gates! Hurry! Were headed to East Rukon District Area 43! Kuchiki, were going now! Kurosaki!

Weve got no clues even after walking around this much… I wonder why the Bounts broke into Seireitei to destroy the Shishinro, Repentance Cell… They probably wanted all of Soul Society to know that theyve come here What do you mean Is that something like an announcement of a crime They took the time to do that Are they stupid They want revenge… It would be a problem if no one noticed Well, we never knew what they were thinking to begin with They seem to be enjoying their crimes… Chad!

The Bounts who came to Soul Society have defeated two lieutenants of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads who tried to fight them They then disappeared into the vast Rukon District Meanwhile, we used Kukakus home as a starting point, and split up and began searching for the Bounts It’s not easy finding the Bounts since they have the ability to hide their Spiritual Pressure At that moment, the female Bount Yoshi appeared before Rukia as she headed to Seireitei to rejoin her Squad The Thirteen Court Guard Squads sensed their Spiritual Pressure and headed to their location But that was just a trick in order to destroy the Shishinro Repentance Cell, a symbol of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads Rukia was thrashed around And when Rukia was about to be killed, Byakuya Kuchiki saved her During that time… We received information that Kariya is hiding in Kusajishi, the worst area in the Rukon District We headed to Kusajishi to find out if the information was true, but… So youre…Jin Kariya… Yeah… It seems like youre just doing whatever you like… Are you here to avenge her It doesnt matter I just have to kill Soul Societys enemies, no matter who they are… Youre not going to take a stance You, too… You can come at me whenever you want I see… I see that Bounts have speed equal to the Flash Step You grazed me Im going next! Ive got you! I hear that the Bounts control puppets… That thing I cant see is your puppet, huh Well…I wonder… Then I just have to cut you down along with your puppet As I expected of Byakuya Kuchiki… Youre far better than the rumors say you are Im glad I met you… What Byakuya Kuchiki, the current head of the Kuchiki family, one of the famous four great noble families… And said to be the strongest in the familys history It’s natural for someone with my level of skill to want to challenge you And… Your strength is satisfying enough… What do you plan to do My plan, huh The invincible Thirteen Court Guard Squads, which protect Soul Society Youre the most famous of all of them… If youre defeated… The people of Seireitei will be shocked Stop talking nonsense… Im serious… Theres no way that I would come here if I werent convinced I could defeat you But youre far more naive than I heard you were… When my comrade tried to finish off Rukia Kuchiki… I’m told you were desperate to protect her Furthermore, youve come by yourself to avenge your younger sister I never thought that you would fall for such a cheap taunt… How silly… I thought I told you, “I just have to kill Soul Societys enemies” Well, thats fine… Whatever the case, youre going to die here as part of our great plan There is no use in talking… Youre the one whos going to die here Scatter, Senbonzakura So this is the famous Senbonzakura… Its a beautiful technique… But seems it wont work on me And now… Allow me to attack Come to me, greater winds… Come into me, greater strength… I thought so… The thing you were controlling earlier was… The wind! Wind Tanz! Die Hado 33! Sokatsui! Hado 4! Byakurai! The Senbonzakuras thousand blades have been split so small that it cannot be seen When they dance, they catch the light, which makes them look like countless flowers falling… But… My doll is wind… There is wind in this world… In other words, there is a limitless amount of air If I gather it, it can create a power that rivals your blade! Its simple number theory Senbonzakura, Kido, and direct attacks from zanpakuto… Theyre wonderful attacks, but they cant cut me Soon, youll be the one on the ground You think so Stop acting tough… The reckless valor to face the Senbonzakura bare-handed… I commend you for that… But…I can cut off your head in a single swipe at this distance Ill cut off your head before you can Now, we cant separate from one another Wind Tanz! Scatter, Senbonzakura One arm is but a small price to pay if I can defeat Byakuya Kuchiki Are you insane Getsugatensho! Hey, Byakuya… Why are you having a tough time after turning down help Heh! What pathetic guys! G-Ganju… Now now, Ganju hasn’t done anything, remember Bonnie was the one who defeated them Oink! Oink! Dont worry about the details… Besides that… That Spiritual Pressure just now was…Ichigo… Yeah… Its Kurosaki! Huh Wheres Ishida He was here just now… He probably headed in Kurosakis direction! Wait! Huh Lets leave it to those two! But… Its all right… Ichigo and Uryu wont die that easily! Ganju… Besides, we need to know whats going on in Kusajishi first Hey, you! Eep--! I-Im sorry… I want to know more about those skilled newcomers who appeared in Kusajishi Y-Yes… It was a guy called Kariya… I thought so… So what is he doing H-He says that hes going to turn Soul Society upside down and is gathering people… Say what! Do you know anything else R-Right now, theyre at the gambling house bookie’s place He said that if we go, something good would happen… Thats all I know… I see Thank you! Ganju, what are we going to do Weve just got to go… But if theyre gathering people, itll be dangerous… Indeed… Oh well… I guess Ill talk to him… By “him,” you cant mean… The Bull of Kusajishi! Brother! That’s dangerous! What do you plan to do when you meet him! Shut up! Its faster to hear about Kusajishi from guys from Kusajishi! But if Bull is with the Bounts… Its all right! Bulls not the type to be coaxed by the Bounts! And Kariya says that he wants to fight with you Fight against who The guys from Seireitei Are you guys serious about attacking that place! Its not worth risking my life over… No… We can win How can you say that! We have a plan What kind of plan I need your approval in order to tell you… Will you fight with us All souls should be sent to Soul Society equally… But, in reality, this world is ruled by a part of it The power of Seireitei There shouldnt be poverty in Rukon District… This place, Kusajishi, is a place where you never know when youll die… And where blood is washed by blood… We had similar experiences in the World of the Living No, in a way… We lived in far worse conditions… so we understand your feelings Dont you want to see the light of day Dont you want to live your lives the way you want… Without looks of scorn from the rest of the world Well… Of course! Everyone wants that! Right! Kariya is going to turn Soul Society upside down! He will! Come with us to a new world! Fine… But I want proof that youre serious Anythings fine Show me how serious you are Ichinose… Draw your zanpakuto! Huh Try and cut this arm What! Wh-Whats this We are invincible You have nothing to worry about… Were going to kill Seireitei itself… Along with you, were going to dissolve Soul Society into the shape it should be! Lirin… This is dangerous, so stand back… Ichigo, what are you going to do Its all right! Whats with that! Im worried about you! Sorry… Humph! Ichigo Kurosaki Hey… You appeared pretty quickly Yeah… Byakuya, are you all right How unnecessary… Heh! Shut up! Ichigo Kurosaki… Ill treat you as an enemy if you interfere Whats this Soul Society is filled with good reishi It raises the power of us Bounts We Bounts are invincible as long as this world is filled with reishi Youre healing your wounds by using reishi, huh You bastard… Here I go Bankai!

Damn… How is he able to keep up with me Im not nearly as fast as you are, but… you could say its my years of fighting experience Theres that What I know which way youre going to move I know… It seems that your wind defense cant protect you against everything No matter how good your defense is, its possible to harm you… if I use an attack thats more powerful Youre better than I thought But…you still wont be able to defeat me I told you… Soul Society is filled with concentrated reishi We Bounts are immortal here Then prove your immortality What the hell! Wh-What is it this time! What Youre…! Huh Huh! Why! Thats the face of that old lady, Yoshino! It cant be… I finally found you What Who…are you My name is Rantao What! No way! Rantao…you say! Yes Rantao… The creator of the Bounts who was exiled from Seireitei! Youre still alive Wait a second! Are you really her And…that face… The attitude of the Soul Reapers has changed quite a bit, hasnt it What So vulgar What! Isnt it enough proof that I know about the Bounts Huh Im the only one who knows about the Bounts other than the Soul Reapers of Seireitei All the information on Bounts, except for a small section… should have been destroyed Youre…a Bount, arent you You know that Im the real Rantao You can feel it, cant you I knew youd come some day Ive waited for a mind-numbingly long time Indeed… It took a long time to get here We Bounts have suffered a painfully long time And…are you the one who forced this upon us! Youre much more emotional than you look… And more short-tempered than you sound… Are you going to kill me Wait! There are a lot of things I want to ask you if you’re really Rantao I cant let you die here! Who said I was going to kill her here What She has to watch us achieve our goal What happened as a result of her actions… Im going to kill her… after I destroy Seireitei You bastard! Byakuya! I told you… Ill kill anyone whos an enemy of Soul Society Youre not getting away! It seems that I can also break… your so-called wind defense! Kariya, lets pull back for now Koga… Dalk! Cause a disturbance! Oh my There are so many handsome men! But Im sorry I cant play with you today! Lirin, do you know where they are Its no good… My sensors couldnt work properly in those explosions! Damn! Hey! What Arent you going to chase Kariya He has already disappeared into the distance Are you saying thats its pointless to go after him Until the next time Jeez Oh well… So… Are you an enemy Or are you an ally There are more people than I thought thered be… Ichinose, at this rate theyll continue to double in number… and will quickly grow into a huge crowd! I guess this means there were a lot who were dissatisfied with Seireitei… Huh Where did Kariya go I dont see Koga anywhere either Theyll be back soon Ichigo, someones coming! What Ishida! Kurosaki! Youre safe… Wh-What! Yoshino No… Its Rantao, the one Yoruichi talked about What! That outfit… A Quincy What in the world…is this A Soul Reaper and a Quincy, huh Thats a pretty amusing combination If youre going against the Bounts, Im not your enemy Then could you tell us about the Bounts Before that… Im going to tend to your wounds My home is nearby We can talk there There, there All right, Bonnie, stop Stop! I think… He should be somewhere around here… Ganju, what are you going to do Well, just watch Whats this Hes the Bull of Kusajishi What do you want, Ganju Hey! Its been a while That hurts! Deal with it! Im almost finished! There Youre healed O-Oh! My wounds are healed! Of course they are Dont underestimate a technician! So…what should I begin talking about How much do you know about the Bounts You were using human souls to do experiments to create a life that never dies I heard that from the leader of the Bounts, Kariya Kariya…I see That man earlier, hes the Bounts… Yeah… The success rate of our experiment should have been very high But there was an accident during the experiment… that affected the cycle of rebirth Thats what created the Bounts, wasnt it Thats right… The Bounts had no place in the World of the Living Even so, they tried to rely on Soul Society, but… Soul Society didnt allow that Allowing Bounts in would mean accepting their existence That would mean admitting that they had created a subspecies as a side effect of the experiment… After being refused entrance… the Bounts tried to force their way into Soul Society And…thats when the Quincies became involved Soul Society took that chance and nearly annihilated the Bounts The ones who managed to escape or were living elsewhere during that battle… are Kariyas group right now If youve gathered that much information, what were you doing until now You created the Bounts Couldnt you have gone to the World of the Living and done something Youre so concerned about the Bounts… As a researcher, didnt you feel attached to the Bounts even if they were created by accident! My Soul Reaper power was sealed away when I was exiled from Seireitei… This includes going to the World of the Living… I cant even escape this place What was that power you used to get between us After many years and much research… I was finally able to get back enough Spiritual Pressure to fight However…Thats also limited… But why were you the only one exiled from Seireitei The ones from Seireitei who exiled me… were relieved to learn that the Bounts didnt have the reishi conversion ability Did they think that everything could be settled in the World of the Living I predicted that the Bounts would use any means they could to come here Thats why I suggested we publicize everything and accept the Bounts And this is the result… You… Quincy Ive caused you a lot of trouble Kariya used your power to come here, didnt he Y-Yes… Thats fine… But why The Bounts used the Quincy power Does that mean you are the Bounts’ ally since you helped them But from what I can see, you seem to be their enemy Whats the meaning of this Well… Well, a lot has happened… Ishida, right Do you know what kind of tool that is What That artifact is…incredibly dangerous If you use it recklessly… I know But I have to use this power to defeat Kariya No matter what happens… You say that youre prepared I see… But be careful Make sure that you dont cause trouble, not only for yourself, but to those around you as well H-Hey! Im all right… But… Didnt you think I looked strange Strange Im quite older than most Soul Reapers What! In other words, I did things to myself as well… in order to wait for the Bounts to come… Sorry, but Im going to rest for about half a day… Half a day! Thats right… Wait! I still have things to ask you… When I recover Until then… It looks like she fell asleep… Jeez I was still talking… She says shes a lot older than she looks It cant be helped… So what are you going to do Are you going to go back to Kukakus home No, we still have things to ask her when she wakes up Were going to rest here, too That sounds like the best thing to do How was Byakuya Kuchiki Not bad… I think fighting him made for a good declaration Was that your true goal Youve been inquiring too much lately, Koga… Thats probably because Im in high spirits Ichinose! Yes! Where are the other three They are watching the movements of Seireitei as planned I see… Its almost time Yes Yes Dont wanna lose! Dont wanna cry! Cuz I wanna keep laughing! MOVIN! MOVIN!

" Woke up with yawning, its dawning Im still alive Turned on my radio To start up new day As goddamed DJ chattered How to survive Amazing news got over On that air wave Tonight, Love is rationed Tonight, Across the nation Tonight Love reflects world wide Almost another day Shes a shooting star Good-night, good-night Shes a shooting star Good-bye… Tonight, Love is rationed Tonight, Across the nation Tonight Love reflects world wide Almost another day See you some other day Ive come to inform you! We have confirmed strange movements in Kusajishi! Strange movements Someone has gathered a large number of thugs to cut the trees in Kusajishi Forest Captain! Is it the work of the Bounts On the surface, it looks like a bookie of one of Kusajishis countless gambling houses is behind it, but… Is there someone else pulling the strings Yes! I also have information concerning that! What should we do This is the clue weve been waiting for Well probably need to investigate Then have someone do a search… No, Matsumoto--! Were going to Abarais place! Renjis place Abarai has had the most contact with the Bounts… I want him to come with us Ive received a report from the reconnaissance guy So what are Kariyas movements Yeah… Theyve gathered an impressive amount of people in a short time… It seems that theyre gathering ruffians from throughout Kusajishi… Theyre pretty tough, but they dont have spiritual power They cant win against Soul Reapers even if they gather in large numbers But theres no way that theyd fight seriously against Rukon District residents, would they Its a huge burden to fight while continually holding back! I see… Indeed… The Bounts are few in number to begin with… Theyre going to think of more than one way to fight Seireitei So what are you going to do Were going to stop them! Theyre a disorderly crowd to begin with Were going to make it easier for the Soul Reapers to fight them by breaking up the crowd! This is the part I have to consult you about, Brother! When did I become your brother! Think nothing of it! At any rate, we dont have time! Could you gather as many of your allies as you can Ganju, why are you so passionate about this A friend of mine is working like mad to do something about the Bounts… I want to help him! A friend Ganju, could you mean Kurosaki Ah, the beautiful power of friendship! No one is ever really alone! Helping each other is more important than anything! Shut up! Oh my! At any rate, he had a terrible time with the Bounts! I dont want to let him die! Tales of friendship, huh! Im amazed you can say that without feeling a bit embarrassed! Well, fine… I never liked that bookie… I, Daiji Hirasako, the Bull of Kusajishi, will help you! So, the Bull of Kusajishi wasnt your real name… Why do you need to go by that name Because its cool! Yeah! They’re so alike… Hey! Conboy! Max! Lady! Yes! Yes! Gather up some sturdy guys! Weve gotten quite good at repairs… Ryoka invasions have become more frequent Everyones probably become more skilled… But nothing is resolved, even if we finish repairs… Who in the world destroyed it, and for what purpose Do you suppose it could be a diversion A diversion The Bounts probably created a diversion upon coming here… But theres no point to it if its repaired… Jeez You sure are naive… This kind of distraction also causes mental shocks… Right now, Seireitei is in complete chaos… Everyone must have become lazy to allow invaders into Seireitei so easily… Wait… Diversion Whats wrong Did you figure something out It cant be…! No… I just remembered something important I have to do! Excuse me! A-An exploding egg… What kind of dream did you have! You sleep too long It looks like youve finally awakened Now lets eat Rantao… Umm… Id like to continue where we left off yesterday Sorry about yesterday I fell asleep half way… Umm…about your face… My face We met a Bount in the World of the Living who had a face that looked very much like… No, exactly like yours… Yoshino Soma… That was the Bount’s name Whats the meaning of this Thats right Thats also what Ive been wondering… The Bount called Yoshino is probably a copy of me Co… A copy! In the experiment to create immortal souls that produced the Bounts… We didnt use normal souls… Theyre not normal souls We created artificial souls that were based on our own, and experimented on them… Artificial souls The experiment for eternal life… Even though it was mathematically possible, still there was a moral problem using human souls So we created artificial souls based on our own souls Then… The artificial souls went through a sudden mutation in the accident during the experiment… and were incorporated within the cycle of rebirth… Thats what the Bounts are Thats right… We created artificial souls based on Soul Reaper souls Its expected that they have incredible power I see… So the Bounts can use Dolls like Soul Reapers use their zanpakuto, right Yes… Afterwards, artificial soul research grew and the gikongan and mod soul technology was developed Then… The Bounts are like my distant relatives I see… Lirin and the others are able to have Bount sensor abilities because theyre based on the same technology… I thought that since they dived through the cycle of rebirth, the features of the Soul Reapers they were based on would not directly surface themselves, but… This Bount called Yoshino resembled me, huh Yes… So what happened to that Bount Kariya killed her… At any rate, we have to stop the Bounts as soon as possible Kenny… Are you going to meet Maki Yeah… The captain of Squad 10 has been able to track them… Im going, too! I also want to see Maki! Gentlemen! Take a rest and listen to me for a moment! First, I want to pay tribute to your courage! This is your fight! You were controlled and discriminated against, even though you are also from the Soul Society Today, you will be released! You are free! We shall now commence an attack on Seireitei! In order to do that… we need your help! I wish you the best of luck! I thought so… What is the matter, Master Mayuri The one who snuck into Seireitei and did the destruction was… Maki Ichinose Take a look at this, Nemu! Yes, Master Mayuri Lately, there havent been Soul Reapers passing through, but… the Senkaimon has been opening and closing frequently This is that record… Ichinose has been coming in and out The gate will open and close when hes passing through the Senkaimon even if hes invisible And no matter how skillfully he hid himself… he wasnt able to completely erase his Spiritual Pressure as he passed Of course, this was something only I was able to notice Hes been breaking into the database… and making alterations and hiding information But that wont work on me Maki Ichinoses Nijigasumi has an ability to use light refraction to make him invisible And the Bounts have a special technique to hide their Spiritual Pressure… If he had that technique, there is no way that he wouldnt use it This means that Ichinose made himself invisible… and was coming into Seireitei and creating diversions There may have been other times when he broke into the database and made alterations… Im going to make a search with this pattern in mind I thought so I never thought that he could break in this often without anyone noticing… What! Whats wrong This is… It cant be… It cant be! Take a look at this! This is… This is the data we retrieved after it was erased! Yes, Master Mayuri I looked at this and thought of… drawing the Bounts to Soul Society by using the Quincy power, but… Was it Ichinose… who showed me this data! They were using me! They had the Quincy use his bow to go to Soul Society! How dare they…those Bounts! Ive found their location Theyre gathering deep in Kusajishi Forest According to our information, theyve gathered an incredible number of thugs… Though thanks to that, the area around Kusajishi is said to have become pretty quiet So…what should we do Since weve come this far, weve got to go The thugs are still residents of Rukon District Try not to harm them if you encounter them Roger Renji… Is your zanpakuto all right Huh You used Higazekko in the World of the Living, didnt you Your zanpakuto hasnt recovered, has it Its all right! I dont have to use my shikai on the likes of thugs… But whatll you do if Bounts come out Well… Well, when that happens, you can run to Seireitei as a messenger How mean… Lets go! Are you going Yeah… Inoues Shunshunrikka just informed me that… the Bounts are doing something in the Kusajishi Forest Weve got to go Rantao, what about you This shouldnt be the only thing that the Bounts are doing I have something I have to prepare just in case… All right… Lets meet again afterwards Yeah… Oh yeah! Hm I have one more thing I had to ask you What is it Rantao… You know about Ishidas artifact, dont you How long will it hold up, in actuality I dont know… It may become useless today… It may be tomorrow… If it goes off accidentally… it may blow away everything within a radius of several thousand meters Well, theres no reason to get scared at this point Ive just got to do what I can! Hey! Be careful… The preparations for a surprise attack on Seireitei are on schedule Good work Master Kariya What is it, Ichinose It seems that several Soul Reapers are approaching this location Theres also a captain… Im thinking of remaining here to deal with them If we deal with the Soul Reapers now, things will be easier later Ill leave it to you Yes! Anything for you Captain! It seems theres no mistake The Bounts are beyond here But it sure is strange… There are much fewer people here than I thought What should we do At any rate, lets split up and move on! Be careful! Right! Right! I found one… Who are you Maki Ichinose Are you the Soul Reaper whos helping the Bounts I am no longer a Soul Reaper… I am a comrade of the great Master Kariya! Where are the Bounts! I dont need to answer you Then Ill force an answer out of you! Come on!

Why are you here Right now, Ganju and the others are… Youre not good enough! At any rate, dont let any of them get away! We came with Ganju and the others to… stop the people gathering in the forest… For some reason, there seems to be only a few people! Whats the meaning of this! Whats wrong, Chad Theres a guy who can control space just like Noba… That old man! Its too late! Master Kariya and the main force have already headed to Seireitei! Are you a Ryoka So what if I am! Hm Who are you A Bount… Go Koga… Sorry, but could you let me in I cant let you pass! Then Ill have to force my way in… Zeig dih, Dalk!

Im not going to let you get to Master Kariya Not letting us get to Kariya, you say How can you be so confident when youre against this many of us Matsumoto, I’ll be fine here… Go on ahead! Captain! I dont think that Seireitei will fall so easily But the Bounts have raised their power abnormally by absorbing reishi Understood Lets go, Renji! Roger! I thought I told you  Im not letting you go! Flash and Burst, Nijigasumi! What is this all of a sudden Isnt it a bit early for mid-day sun Its so bright! What! This is… Ichinose! Captain Hitsugaya! Abarai! Why are you here Thats what I want to ask… I thought that Ichinose swung at me, but it turned out to be you What What in the world is going on! Dont move recklessly! Well end up attacking each other! What, what Seems itll be dangerous to move This is…Ichinoses zanpakutos power Thats right My Nijigasumi is a zanpakuto of light… The light that Nijigasumi releases… reflects and refracts the air around you and creates this space An illusion created by light reflections But…hes a Soul Reaper… Hes different from the Bounts Even if we cant see him… I cant even sense his Spiritual Pressure! Can he travel through space like Noba No, its different… I never sensed him opening up space Could it be that he erased his Spiritual Pressure Thats… The cave that the Bounts were hiding in had a special mineral that shut out all Spiritual Pressure Huh Is he using that… Damn! At this rate… Matsumoto! He’ll keep attacking us if we dont move! Youre going to die here Everyone, be careful! Its useless… Wha--! What happened! You! Hey Its been a while, Ichinose Zaraki Itchy, we found you! Yachiru! Jiggly, its been a while! How are you Im great! What about you Ichigo… When you come here, Yeah Im great! visit my Squad first Well give you a warm reception Oh, no, well, next time… Zaraki! Hey… It seems like something interesting is happening He blew away his Spiritual Pressure with his enormous Spiritual Pressure Thats crazy… Captain Zaraki! The Bounts are headed to Seireitei We were stopped by him, and… Oh Kenpachi Zaraki! Ichinose… Youre with the Bounts now, right Whats wrong with that! The head of the Bounts Was he called Kariya Thats none of your business! Heh! Youre the same as usual… So, what are you going to do Youve got to stop these guys, dont you I wont interfere if thats what youre going to do What! Zaraki, you bastard! But if youre going to remain here, Ill fight you if you want me to Indeed…If I really care about Master Kariya, then I should help the charge on Seireitei by… drawing in as many Soul Reapers as I can But… But… Oh Master Kariya… Im very sorry! You look a little more determined than when I last saw you Kenpachi Zaraki! I will cut you down! All right… I was just getting bored Ill take you on Show me how much youve improved Wow! Kenny and Maki, give it your best! Shut up! Youre making me lose my concentration Step aside for a moment! Okay! Hey! Say… Let this be between Kenny and Maki, okay Is it all right Yeah I think that Maki would like it that way All right! Lets go! Yes! Well leave this to you! Now then Shall we begin Come on Attack me! Dont underestimate me! Hey, hey, hey! Did you think that you could cut me at this level Whats wrong Is that it Im not finished yet! Whats this Heh! How silly! Dont fight blandly! This is the end! Zaraki! Hm Flash and Burst! Nijigasumi! My Nijigasumi makes all things invisible when it shines There are no shadows to hide in wherever it shines! So nothings changed at all He repelled it with his Spiritual Pressure! Did you think that you could defeat me at this level Didnt you improve your skills by leaving Soul Society! Youre not a challenge… Im going to finish this! Makis Spiritual Pressure changed… Youre still hiding something Dont hold back Show it to me! Kenpachi Zaraki… This is where the real fight begins! Flash and Burst! Saigyoku Nijigasumi! Kenpachi Zaraki… This is where the real fight begins! Flash and Burst! Saigyoku Nijigasumi! Oh Whats with that Spiritual Pressure How interesting! A good reaction! Youve gotten a little better! So you can do it if you try You bastard! Your attitude hasnt changed at all! Why did the Thirteen Court Guard Squads allow someone like you to be a captain! As its name indicates… arent the Thirteen Court Guard Squads… supposed to defend those theyve sworn to protect! Why do you fight! Where do your loyalties lie! This again, huh Why do I fight Because its amusing, of course! I dont need a reason! You really dont have any right to call yourself a captain of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads! I have a problem with the way Soul Society thinks And Ive returned with Master Kariya, who also feels the same way Ill risk everything for Master Kariya! I’ve gained this power solely for that purpose! Stop rambling! Take me down with force if you dont like me! What! Whats this This is Nijigasumis true power Saigyoku Nijigasumi! Disappear… Kenpachi Zaraki! Kenpachi Zaraki is dead Nijigasumi receives my Spiritual Pressure and creates limitless beams of light Those beams erase and engulf all shadows Kenny isnt dead Indeed He seems to be breathing still… The light that engulfed Kenpachi Zaraki will soon be compressed into a high-density beam and he will perish There is no way to escape Kenny wont lose How pitiful… Now, the compression has started Where am I I dont know why, but its hard to move… I dont have enough… Spiritual Pressure…eh Where are you going Im going to Master Kariya What about your showdown with Kenny He wont return Kenny is alive Hes dead! Ill cut you down, too, if you interfere! Dont just write me off! It cant be! This is impossible! What! How did…you… Well, I just released the Spiritual Pressure I was holding back for a bit Impossible… Are you saying that you suppressed… the Spiritual Pressure of Nijigasumi with even greater Spiritual Pressure Thats a Kido-type zanpakuto, isnt it What…about it Its just like you Well, I commend you for making me use even just a bit of my full power Even if it was a makeshift technique… A light that erases and engulfs all shadows You idiot… The idea of shining light on everything is impossible to begin with Youll always create shadows wherever you shine light How can someone like you… someone who has no noble goals… have so much power! As opposed to my captain who gave everything for justice! Why you--! Dont you understand that there is nothing in Soul Society we can trust! Weve come to serve justice Why do you stand before us! Its because of people like you that… People like… How stupid! Noble my ass! Is that really your goal Doesn’t someone else give you everything Dont talk as if you understand! Thats why I say that youre no good Relying on people and loyalty are different things Its no fun fighting guys who dont have their own goals Then…then why did you fight me! Was it to have fun making me a laughingstock! Heh! If you wanted to achieve that Kariya guy’s goals… then werent you supposed to stop Ichigo and the others first But you chose to face me Wasnt that your own choice Your power is the power you gained through hatred in order to kill me… Hit me with all of that hatred This man… Could it be… Kenny… Maki… Did you make up your mind Master Kariya… Im sorry… I, Maki Ichinose, may not be of any use in the very end… Even so…forgive me… Come on! Kenpachi Zaraki! Captain… It still wasnt enough, huh Kenny… I went all out… Lets go home! Yeah… You always lament on how boring this town is …Searching for a place in the sun The melody you hum is that rusty, same old song …Rejecting any new song Youre anxious because somewhere in your heart, you believe in the future Baby, its you; That pain will eventually become a memory Youre the only one Dont think, just feel, let your whole body tremble; future is you!! Baby, its me; Youre never alone, Im right here We should be as one; Even if you stumble, I don’t mind I want to tell you now about the thing called love Kenny, shouldnt you return to Seireitei Yeah Theres no need to hurry Ichigo will become stronger if he fights the Bounts Ill defeat him when he does Thats so smart! Well, if thats the case… Good luck, Ichigo My stomach is suddenly sore! The Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers Golden after these messages! Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! Welcome!

What kind of joke is that We were going to… I said that your role is over What are you talking about! Werent we going to crush Seireitei together! Youre just a pawn Or, to put it another way, youre just a means to open this gate Seireiheki shuts out all spiritual power In other words, it is impossible to destroy it or pass through it using spiritual power You bastard! You were using us! Im just saying that youre of no use now From this point on, its my tribes battle Youre just in the way if you linger around What do you mean! No way! Weve been tricked!

They call themselves Soul Reapers Theyre pathetic The real battle is about to begin Dont underestimate the captains I told Mabashi and Yoshi to create diversions You two crush each squad captain one by one while Mabashi and Yoshi are causing riots What about you Our final goal is to completely destroy Seireitei Instantaneously They created us, and yet they tried to wipe away our existence Judgment must be passed upon the Seireitei for their actions But we need something in order to do that Im going to go and get that Are you saying that theres something with that kind of destructive force in Soul Society There is Where is it At the Department of Research and Development What is it Youll soon find out… Our final meeting place is the Sokyoku Hill Got it What is it If you have something to say, then say it No… Good luck… Go Jidanbo… Get ahold of yourself… Thank goodness! Ah…youre… Its been a while Whats this You saved me again It was nothing… Does it still hurt No, everythings all right! Ichigo!

Thanks, Jidanbo! Lets go! Hey! Are you all right! Im all right! Go quickly! His wounds have opened… Lets go, everyone! Hes trying his best in spite of his wounds! Dont let his efforts go to waste!

No way… Inoue, is that all right Yeah! Im all right! Leave it to me! Jidanbo, you can let go now Thanks… Take care of him, Inoue! Yeah! Orihime! Orihime! How could you! Inoue stayed back because she wanted to Take her feelings into consideration… But… Besides, theres a reason she left you with us What Lirin, how are the Spiritual Pressure of the Bounts Hmm… I dont sense any right now I wonder if theyre hiding it I see… But theyve come this far with a goal They cant hide their Spiritual Pressure forever Youre the ones who can sense the Bounts the best Well, thats right, but… We need your help! Kurodo, were counting on you! Hmm… I understand! If thats the case, then Ill trust Orihime and give it my all to search for the Bounts… I will find them… Man, once his mouth opens… …and crush he just doesn’t stop their plan Yeah… In Soul Society… Split up! Right now, we have to track the Bounts! All right! We will, too… Yes! Captain… A hell butterfly-- Thirteen Court Guard Squads… In accordance with special order level one, all captains are urgently summoned We will hold a captains meeting I repeat… Thirteen Court Guard Squads… In accordance with special order level one, all captains are urgently summoned We will hold a captains meeting At a time like this! Continue dispatching to the assigned areas! We can only keep searching until we find them! When you do find them, dont approach them immediately! Contact other groups and wait for help! Thats all! Yes! Aw man! Im not getting any hits at all! Just keep searching! Damn… Where did Kariya go! Ichigo, youre so hyped up! What good is it not to be hyped at a time like this! No! Calm down a bit! Huh Why-- My sensors dont work properly with someone whos worked up next to me! Is that so Yes! All right! How is it Not yet Really! You run a lot more roughly than Orihime Jeez! Stop complaining! Hey… Youre the Punishment Force, arent you Are you a Ryoka A Ryoka Who knows Forget that, I heard you guys are strong… Oh You want to fight, huh Zeige Dich, Ritze Ritze, go! Understood! Damn! Dont let him get away! Where is Captain Jushiro Ukitake of Squad 13 Hes sleeping It seems that hes not feeling well again… I see… Squad 2 Captain Yes! Tell me the status of the Punishment Force… I have already positioned groups throughout Seireitei Very good… A very quick response Yes! So what has the captain of Squad 10 done in comparison to the Punishment Force I heard that he was the commander for the annihilation of the Ryoka… But it seems that he allowed them to invade Seireitei He has some nerve, calling himself a commander… I wont make excuses It is all my fault Now, now It cant be helped that they got in Weve got to think of what to do next Captain Kuchiki It seems that you fought the man called Kariya… I heard that hes their boss I want you to reveal what you know to everyone He can control wind Wind Furthermore, he can control reishi and has a powerful regenerative ability Dont change the topic! I was saying that we should question the responsibility of the captain of Squad 10 Ive heard about it… About what About a Quincy tool… They were able to come here because someone gave them a Quincy tool that was in the Department of Research and Development… That was probably all a set up… What are you trying to say No, I was just thinking that youre good at ignoring your own shortcomings Think about other peoples  feelings a little I am also irritated right now! And I know how to take responsibility That aside, where did you hear about that! I have sharp ears… This is not the time to be quarreling! This is an order! The Thirteen Court Guard Squads are to spread out within Seireitei… and destroy the Ryoka when they find them! It is best if we deal with the Ryoka as soon as possible Therefore, from now on, each squad will take their own actions The Squad 10 captain will be relieved of his duties as temporary commander Reports are to be done quickly and immediately That is all Master Mayuri, are you  going out in person Of course! I hate being made fun of more than anything! Jeez Time was wasted on that unnecessary captains meeting! Dont think this is over, Bounts! Im leaving you in charge! Do what needs to be done! Yes, Master Mayuri Whats wrong! I sense a Bount! What! Where! Now it disappeared! Youre not just saying things, are you How rude! I was positive! Damn! Curse those Bounts for sneaking around! Guerrilla warfare is most effective when taking on an army with a few people Its reasonable The enemy is pretty good… What good will it do to praise them Excuse me… Anyway, lets hurry to the place where you sensed them! Which way is it! Yes, yes! Turn right at that corner! Aw, man! Its appearing and disappearing like an old flashlight! This is so annoying! Youre pretty hyped up despite telling me to calm down! Its fine if its me! It doesnt matter if Im the one thats hyped up! Jeez Thats so selfish… Did you say something Nothing! How is it I sense them Which way It disappeared… I sense them Which way It disappeared… Hey! Yo! Youre a Ryoka, arent you Whats with the scary faces You bastard! Ritze! Im coming! Whats this! Were moving on, Ritze! Understood! Mabashi is doing well Now then, I should go as well Reporting! It appears that group two and group three have met the Ryoka! Did they get them The information is complicated The result is unknown How irritating… Im very sorry Go ahead of me! Gather all groups at Seireiteis northern streets! I will follow shortly! Yes! Group two and group three, give me your reports… Group two reporting! The Ryoka we apprehended got away Group three reporting! We encountered a Ryoka at Western Street Number Five We were unable to apprehend him… What are you doing! A level one guard position has been ordered out! What good will it do us if the Punishment Force isnt functioning properly! Ritze… Its about time… Rearrange battle positions! Groups one and two are to spread out along the western streets! Groups three and four are to make a detour eastward and head for the main road! Yes! Do it! Captain! Who did that! Whats going on Hold him down! You bastard! Captain! Captain! Whats this What did you do! You always lament on how boring this town is …Searching for a place in the sun The melody you hum is that rusty, same old song …Rejecting any new song Youre anxious because somewhere in your heart, you believe in the future Baby, its you; That pain will eventually become a memory Youre the only one Dont think, just feel, let your whole body tremble; future is you!!

Well help you if youre having problems Right As they say, Even chance meetings are the result of karma, and One who is kind to others is sure to be rewarded Wh-Why would I want to be helped by the likes of you! Where are you, Ichigo Kurosaki! There you are Running away isnt any different than what Ive been doing all this time! Just watch! This is just the beginning! Make a turn there! What--!

I dont know where he is Hes not a kid Besides, we have a hands-off policy in our home Liar! You cling to your daughters! Yuzu and Karin are different! Or rather a special case! As different as night and day! Besides Even if you arent  interested in me, Ive come to kill you It would be a problem if you didnt fight me You came to kill me! Pretty big talk for a Soul Reaper! You dont think Im any normal Hollow, do you! Look! This is the true form of my power! Wh-What incredible size Hes as large as  those Menos I saw before Or larger Menos Dont treat me like one of those! We are An Arrancar Theyre a group of Hollows aiming to attain Soul Reaper powers by removing their masks Isnt that right Whats this  Youre pretty knowledgeable In that case, you probably know that you cant win against my sword A zanpakuto! Its incredibly huge Thats right! A zanpakutos size equals the size of ones Spiritual Pressure It is quite obvious that puny zanpakuto cannot beat my zanpakuto boy I see In that case Lets do this! It seems that even though you know the situation youre a fool who doesnt have any Soul Reaper common sense Let your death give you understanding! Impossible Ill teach you the basics Captain-level Soul Reapers all control the size of their zanpakuto If they didnt, theyd all be  swinging swords as large as buildings Just like you Remember this You cant tell how strong your opponent is by the size of his zanpakuto Only then can you talk to me about Soul Reapers, boy I met you at age 16 and we had an eternal love Beneath cherry blossoms petals gently fluttering downward That steep and sunny hill where I ran up to see you, And our shadows at the corner of the park, they are still unchanged even today You, me, and cherry blossom days, we dance and sway in the wind Holding in our heart the unseen future, we look up at the pink sky A lot of difficult terms appeared today I shall therefore explain to you what the Visored and the Arrancar are in the next episode If you would like to attend the Kisuke Urahara Talk Show Get an application when you buy  something at Uraharas Shop and send it to the address below You dont have to send one in! - Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! - Golden Howve you been doing lately Not good I changed my sunglasses, but no one noticed Sunglasses How dull Look at me!

Oh! That world I dreamed of Is peaceful every day, without any conflict But in reality, there are troubles every day And sometimes I regret, these Rolling days Lies probably have little meaning ~All my loving Otherwise, how can I go on A Sweet Love I dreamed of where lovers search for a hideaway But in reality, the days we cant meet Go on; but we still believe, these Rolling days We may stumble, but Way to go!! Yeah!! Yeah!! A mud-caked Rolling star!!

Yeah! Yeah! Yahoo! Did you get it Your revenge You came Urahara Its been a while, Mr Isshin Well It looks like your skills havent faded Im relieved Whats this Thats a pretty normal thing for you to say Of course! I would hate it if you blamed me if your Spiritual Pressure had withered away I see Dont worry I wouldnt blame you if it had faded along with my skills How is it, being a Soul Reaper for the first time in 20 years Not bad Do youfeel better Not bad I never hated that Hollow to begin with If there was something Ive hated for over 20 years It would be my weakness that night when I couldnt save Masaki That part of you never changes Youre just like your son Im not like him! You are! I say Im not! Then Ill leave it at that Speaking of your son, have you noticed Yeah As youve predicted theyve made contact The Masked Army The Visored The Visored What is that They called them the Masked Army THE MASKED ARMY VISORED Theyre an outlaw group of former Soul Reapers who tried to gain Hollow powers by using forbidden techniques Their whereabouts and aims are unknown This is troublesome The only thing that I do know is that the Visored and the Arrancar are not teamed with each other But theyre not our allies The Visored hate Soul Reapers as well Yeah But they made contact with your son That must mean Yeah Theyre preparing for some sort of battle Just like we are They have probably noticed the sudden change in the Arrancar So that Hollow really had its mask removed A broken mask An Arrancar BROKEN MASK ARRANCAR So now theyre going to read this as Arrancar Until now, weve detected the naturally occurring Arrancar from time to time But compared to the mock Arrancar weve confirmed up until now, this ones level of perfection was like nothing weve ever seen before Mock Arrancar didnt change for decades, but they suddenly jumped a level Its all so sudden You understand what this means, right This means Sosuke Aizen He made contact with the mock Arrancar and is trying to create a true Arrancar using the Hogyokus power According to my calculations, the Hogyoku was supposed to take another year to mature Of course, that power isnt complete That Arrancar was still incomplete He has jumped a level, but his Spiritual Pressure was impure He was probably a test subject to gather information on how well he could fight at this level Theyre at this level now, but the Hogyokus power is immense Aizen will probably be pushing his research so that they can be used in battle Hell lead those completed true Arrancar and a Menos army And come to crush the world What should we do Lets do what we can Whatever the case, this is the situation Enemy or ally, were all going to make a move The Visored Usand Soul Society Oh Someones coming in this direction This Spiritual Pressure Its your son Itll be troublesome to see him Come on, everyone Lets all go home - O-Okay - O-Okay I see All right Ill be there immediately Tsk! What a pain Thank you all for coming at such short notice! We shall now commence the Captains meeting! KARAKURA FIRST HIGH SCHOOL What was that Spiritual Pressure Theres no trace of anyone Damn!

Orihime is a nice girl who wont make a face even if you do something bad to her So an idiot like you clinging on to her without realizing that has no reason to live in this world!

You dont have to kill him Come here for a second, Hirako What Whats wrong with Ichigo Snapping like that Since when was he the hot-blooded type I-Ichigo Ow! That hurts What is it You dont need to get so mad Its not as if Orihime is your girlfriend Of course, theres no way that someone like you could get anywhere with a beauty like her Thats not it! Anyway, apologize to Inoue afterwards! You should do that! Like I just said, theres no reason for you to tell me that Hirako Why are you still coming to this school! Dont be unreasonable Its a students duty to go to school Didnt you come to our school to recruit me! In that case, you dont have any business here anymore! Why Did you really think that Id give up so easily Im persistent Ill hang around you until you say yes Its too late Once you become a Visored, you cant go back Whatever you may think, youre already on our side, Ichigo Orihime The big guy Four-eyes You think of them all as your friends, dont you Theyre not Theyre only your friends for now If you continue to be a Soul Reaper as you have been, sooner or later Your inner Hollowll swallow you up Youll lose your sanity Its over if that happens Your power will destroy everything Your friendsand your future Everything will get pulled in and crushed Youve already realized that, havent you Your inner Hollow has become so large that you cant handle it anymore Come with me, Ichigo Ill teach you how to maintain your sanity Ichigo!

So How many are we supposed to kill anyway One Theres no need to kill anyone else This place is overflowing with them and you wanna kill just one Here in the World of the Living Im told there are perhaps three who have the Spiritual Pressure to fight up to par The rest are trash It will be easy to search them out Im surprised Huh Theres a survivor Wh-What happened!

Long time no see well, maybe not You guys What have you done to my room light Huh! I thought youd see the light! Whats that Now, dont get all serious like that Lets try to enjoy all this, shall we That uniform is a dangerous weapon, Sister! Is that the latest fad No, hes always like this INTERNAL MEDICINE / PEDIATRICS KUROSAKI CLINIC The Arrancars are a group of Hollows that have removed their masks, and have gained the powers of both Hollows and Soul Reapers Until recently, they were few and imperfect but now that Aizen, with his Hogyoku, has come into contact with them, mature Arrancar have been born Thats what those two were the other day Youre with us so far Yeah, I understand If not for the sketchbook Id understand it better In the beginning, Soul Society planned to take a wait-and-see attitude until Aizen decided to take matters into his own hands On our side, three of our captains pulled out and went over to the enemy Besides, things were in an uproar due to that Bount incident But meanwhile, the Arrancars were completed quicker than we expected and they were sent into this world, so we couldnt sit back any longer And thats when we were quickly selected Who made the selections General Captain Yamamoto The Central 46 has been vacant since Aizen eliminated the leaders During its vacancy, the General Captain has the decision-making authority So, the one who knows you best, Rukia, was chosen No! I was chosen for my abilities! And out of the combatants they could mobilize, I was selected for being the closest to Rukia Then I was told to choose those other than the captains that I trusted most, so I asked Ikkaku to accompany me Then Yumichika said he had to come along and Rangiku, who heard the uproar, said she wanted to come because it sounded interesting Rangiku wouldnt be swayed, so Captain Hitsugaya was forced to come along to supervise And so were here Is this a picnic! Anyway Aizens definitely got his eye on you, Ichigo Kurosaki Aha! Its Captain Hitsugaya, the only one who refused to go up into the ceiling with us! Were you waiting up on the roof all this time Thats not good! You know how you stand out like a silver-haired elementary student Shut up! Its true that an Arrancar is born when the mask is removed from a Hollow But removing the mask of your run-of-the-mill Hollow wouldnt get you much of anything If youre serious about declaring war on Soul Society itll naturally be something greater than the Menos Greater than the Menos What That sounds like youre saying there are Hollows stronger than the Menos Yeah Well, more precisely, there are three classes within the Menos The first is the Gillian, the lowest class within the Menos, and they are many Their characteristic is that they all look the same The Hollow you banished in this world, soon after you gained the power of a Soul Reaper was of this kind I guess you could call them the small fry That onewas a small fry Theyre huge, but their movements are sluggish and they are no more intelligent than beasts It doesnt take much for a captain to kill one The problem begins with the next level The second class is the Adjuchas Theyre somewhat smaller than the Gillians, and there are fewer of them, but they are highly intelligent and much better fighters than the Gillians They control the large numbers of Gillians And the third are the Vasto Lordes They are the top class within the Menos They are equal to humans in size There are said to be only a few of them within Hueco Mundo, but Ill give it to you straight These Vasto Lordes are stronger than our Soul Reaper captains! The power gained by the Menos by turning into Arrancars is an unknown quantity But now that three of our captains have defected to lead the Menos, this is a fact If Aizen now has more than ten of these Vasto Lordes under his control Itll be the end of Soul Society We have returnedLord Aizen Welcome back Ulquiorra Yammy Now, tell me of your achievements in front of your 20 brothers I met you at age 16 and we had an eternal love Beneath cherry blossoms petals gently fluttering downward That steep and sunny hill where I ran up to see you, And our shadows at the corner of the park, they are still unchanged even today You, me, and cherry blossom days, we dance and sway in the wind Holding in our heart the unseen future, we look up at the pink sky In the next episode, I will hold a dinner show at my palace in Hueco Mundo You can look forward to Ulquiorras report on the World of the Living I am at your service, Lord Aizen Uh Where will it be held That is a secret Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! Tetsuzaemonfor a long time now I havent received any orders to go to the World of the Living I wonder why Well it takes a very serious situation to warrant sending a captain I have even prepared a gigai so that I can go to the World of the Living at any time Captain Komamuras gigai! I wonder why Well"

If Aizen now has more than ten of these Vasto Lorde under his control Itll be the end of Soul Society We have returnedLord Aizen Welcome back, Ulquiorra Yammy Now, tell me of your achievements in front of your 20 brothers Show me, Ulquiorra what you saw and felt in the World of the Living, everything Yes, sir Please have a look I see And that is why you decided he was not worth killing Yes Your orders were to kill him if he proved to be a hindrance to us How soft of you! I wouldve squashed those bastards with my first blow Grimmjow Whatever the reasoning, if kill him was a part of the order, it would have been best to kill him, of course! Right! I agree whatever the case, hes the enemy There may have been no reason to kill him, but there was even less reason to let him live And besides, Yammy! You were beaten up pretty bad! You may say he wasnt worth killing, but it just sounds like you couldnt kill him Damn you, Grimmjow Werent you watching The ones who beat me up were the guy wearing clogs and the dark-skinned girl You dont get it, do you Im saying I would have killed those two with one blow as well! Whats that! Dont Grimmjow Do you understand that our problem isnt this guy as he is now Huh What Lord Aizen is worried about is not this guy as he is now, but this guys rate of growth True, his potential powers were amazing But they were as unstable as they were great If we leave things as is, then theres a chance of him either destroying himself, or that we could bring him under our control Thats why I came back without killing him Thats why Im saying youre soft! If he gets bigger than you predict and turns against us, what do you plan to do! If that happens, Ill get rid of him Thats all Cant complain about that, can you Yes, well Thats fine Do whatever you wantUlquiorra Thank you very much Say, is that really going to get it out Oh Its out! This is it! Ugh It just seems so yucky The Soul Candy came out so easily It sure is made simply, or should I say poorly - Thats the Department of Research - Hey - and Development for you, very unique - Hey, I said!

Youre staying But where are you going to sleep Let me make this clear We dont have enough space to keep all of you! Huh! Not even me Y-Yikes! If you think about it, youre the last person Id allow to stay! For that matter, I have no idea why you would think Id let you stay in the first place! What are you doing! You may undo a button, but whats impossible is impossible! Not even if you lift your skirt a little! Damn! I will not give in to temptation! Im a man who never gives in to temptation! If thats the case, why dont you close your fingers Well, for now Ill have Orihime put me up! What do you mean Did you already get her permission Not yet, but shes the type that just cant say no Wha-- Inoue and Rangiku will be sleeping in the same room What a wonderful forbidden flower garden! How about a little mascot for your flower gard-! Do you want to come too, Captain You think Id go, idiot! You should come! Itll be fun For you, maybe Were going too You have somewhere to go Of course not No need to worry And most of all, I wont depend on you Ill find a place to stay on my own Youd better keep that wooden sword hidden! Well then, Ill be going to Mr Uraharas place Youre going to live off of him again Of course not! But Theres something I want to ask him about Is that so Be careful! So Where do you plan to stay Hey! Wait a minute! - Rukia! - Dont be a fool! This is the only place for me, of course! Are you crazy! My family has seen you! What excuse are you planning to give them! Listen to me, you! Oh I smell a Hollow Shall we take care of it Leave it Too much trouble Theres that Soul Reaper Kurumadani or whatever in charge, right Hm I guess so But for a Hollow, it smells a little funny Why do I keep worrying over it I feel stupid And you know, Kurosaki has recovered! And you know And I guess Kuchiki is really something I think Ima little jealous KUROSAKI CLINIC And so you see Ive lost everything my place to stay and my money for food Oh boy Please let her stay here, Dad! Youve got it, Yuzu! Thats exactly what I was thinking! Stay as long as you like, Rukia! No, no Keep that thumb hidden, will you Theyll catch on to your act Mother! Listen to me, Mother! I now have a third daughter! Of course, judging from the way hes acting, theres no sign he has any doubts Yeah It hit me in that instant! A uniform, depending on whos wearing it, can become a lethal blade! Like an invincible blade that can shred our steel armor of logic into nothingness Will you pipe down Ill leave you behind Huh! Wait! - You have no reaction at all - Ah, no I dont mean you! Hey! Hold it, will you Huh What is that Im really going to leave you behind, Mr Asano! Quit being so formal! I mean! I saw this really realistic monster up in the sky! Will you stop that, Mr Asano! Stop that! You want to stay over Here Thats fine, but Why - Great answer! - O-Ow! I knew youd say that!

And next time, I swear I will protect you Kuchiki isreally something, isnt she Kurosaki was so depressed for so long but she cheered him up She gave him a swift boot and made him perk up Im terrible, arent I I wanted Kurosaki to cheer up Thats all I wanted Or so I thought, but When Kuchiki came back and cheered up Kurosaki I should have been really happy, and yet And yet And yetI-Im jealous of Kuchiki Kuchiki is kind and gentle strong and pretty and she cheered up Kurosaki I really like herbut why am I so I dont feel like this in school, but when I return home and Im alone, Im a mess Oh This is so embarrassing! Im terrible Rangiku Ow-ow-ow! Silly girl Tickle-tickle-tickle- tickle-tickle-tickle! Please stop! Rangiku-san Ouch! Oh, I hit my head! Silly girl You should just be yourself You and Kuchiki both Ichigo is still a kid who cant stand up by himself Thats why he needs both you and Kuchiki Whats wrong with being jealous Why, youre trying your best to come to terms with your serious emotions, arent you Do you know Its so much easier to run away from those emotions; tossing them at the other person Youre standing firm, trying to deal with them Thats really cool, you knowOrihime There, there Let it all out, you! You can cry on my chest, anytime! Everyone here You didnt let anyone see you, I hope Of course not Grimmjow Yeah On the way here, I felt strong Spiritual Pressure from several sources It doesnt match Ulquiorras report Turn the Pesquisa all the way up! Just as I thought There are a lot more I guess theyve called for reinforcements from Soul Society If theyd nipped it in the bud, things wouldnt have gotten so complicated Thats why I say youre soft Ulquiorra! D Roy Shawlong Edrad Illfort Nakeem Capture all of them! If they show even a hint of Spiritual Pressure, capture them all!

I’ve had my fill! It was delicious, Orihime! R-Really Of course! It didn’t look all that great, but it tasted great Oh, I’m so glad! No matter how much I cook, there’s no one to eat the food so I thought maybe there was something wrong with my taste buds! Oh, yes! Would you like some ice cream, Rangiku Oh, that sounds good! Let’s see… If you put all kinds of toppings on it, it’s even better! What would you like – Delicious! – Delicious! What do you have in yours, Orihime Would you like to try it What a weird color! But it might be good! – Yum! – Yum! Have you captured them all You will show them no mercy! If they show even a glimmer of Spiritual Pressure, kill them all! Don’t let a single one escape! Let’s go! I met you at age 16 and we had an eternal love Beneath cherry blossoms petals gently fluttering downward That steep and sunny hill where I ran up to see you, …And our shadows at the corner of the park, they are still unchanged even today You, me, and cherry blossom days, we dance and sway in the wind Holding in our heart the unseen future, we look up at the pink sky The blade of your Tensa Zangetsu is as black as your heart Shut up!

Owww! At the present time, Rukia has the strength of a seated officer! Pyon However, if she is assigned a seat, the risk level of her missions will be much greater than if she were to remain in the rank-and-file Hence, a certain person did not want to put Rukia in the face of danger, approached the captains and requested that she be taken off the list of candidates to be assigned seats A certain person… Yes… Byakuya Kuchiki… You see, pyon And I said it’s all for nothing So just get off of me! Oww! I’ll just make your arm go pyon♪ How long are you going to keep that up Enough already, we must hurry and… What!

Hey kid Y-Yes I have a juicy proposition… You’re interested, right Well…err… It depends on the proposition, don’t you think Frankly, we don’t have a room for the night On top of that, you’re now involved in this fight and about to get killed Err…I think you’re the one who’s about to get killed And so! I will save you from that guy So put us up at your house for a while Huh Not “huh”! Is it gonna be “yes” or “no”! Y-Yes! All right! Its decided! Hey… Hmm You haven’t told me your name yet, you big oaf Huh Me I’m Arrancar Trece… Humph! Hmm No, never mind Introductions aren’t necessary since I’m about to kill you Is that so It seems you and I have different styles of protocol Huh “Always introduce yourself to the one you’re about to kill” That’s the final etiquette that I teach to every pupil I train If you’re putting your life on the line, you’d want to know who it was that killed you Know me as Third Seat of Zaraki’s Squad, Ikkaku Madarame! But don’t bother to tell me your name Just make sure you remember my name! It’s the name of the man… Who will kill you! I met you at age 16 and we had an eternal love Beneath cherry blossoms petals gently fluttering downward That steep and sunny hill where I ran up to see you, …And our shadows at the corner of the park, they are still unchanged even today You, me, and cherry blossom days, we dance and sway in the wind Holding in our heart the unseen future, we look up at the pink sky Captain, the hard skin of an Arrancar is written as “steel skin” and is read “Hierro” Matsumoto, I wonder which is thicker… Theirs or the skin on your face Oh please!

" I want to live in a world of peace without conflict, like the one I dreamed of I cant be patient any longer There are things I must say At the evening bus stop on the way home I Wave to those sunken shoulders, Bye Bye Bye Got to show your Fighting Pose, Oh! Oh! That world I dreamed of Is peaceful every day, without any conflict But in reality, there are troubles every day And sometimes I regret, these Rolling days Lies probably have little meaning ~All my loving Otherwise, how can I go on A Sweet Love I dreamed of where lovers search for a hideaway But in reality, the days we cant meet Go on; but we still believe, these Rolling days We may stumble, but Way to go!! Yeah!! Yeah!! A mud-caked Rolling star!! Soul Reapers They are the spiritual guardians of the World of the Living They are the balancers who keep a close eye on the countless souls, good and evil, that fill this world Aizen, who has brought chaos upon the Soul Society, has begun to set his plan into motion Arrancars, created by Aizen using the Hogyoku, a material that removes the boundaries between Soul Reapers and Hollows, appear in Karakura Town Meanwhile, the Visored, Soul Reapers who have Hollow powers appear before Ichigo Once you become a Visored, you cant go back Come with me, Ichigo But at that time, Aizens formidable Arrancars had gathered in Karakura and begun to battle the advance troop led by Captain Hitsugaya Dance! Sodenoshirayuki! D Roy, who appears before Ichigo and Rukia, is destroyed by Rukias ice-snow zanpakuto, Sodenoshirayuki But immediately after this, Grimmjow appears before the two Ikkaku is confronted by Edrad, Illfort stands before Renji, and Hitsugaya and Rangiku face Shawlong and Nakeem And they call upon their various true powers as they begin to battle Whats the matter Is that all a Soul Reaper is! Huh! You havent told me your name yet, you big oaf Introductions arent necessary since Im about to kill you Is that so It seems you and I have different styles of protocol Always introduce yourself to the one youre about to kill Thats the final etiquette that I teach to every pupil I train If youre putting your life on the line, youd want to know who it was that killed you Know me as Third Seat of Zarakis Squad, Ikkaku Madarame! But dont bother to tell me your name Just make sure you remember my name! Its the name of the man who will kill you! What! Why dont you use your zanpakuto Is that thing on your waist just for show! We Arrancars have iron-like skin known as Hierro, which swords cannot penetrate Its our armor! My bare hands are enough to handle your sword! Oh yeah I see It seems youre pretty aware of what kind of attack itll take to lose an arm Im to draw my zanpakuto for a Soul Reaper like you How humiliating Dont say that Ill even let you release it Wh-Wha- Whats going on! Who are they! Werent you listening just now Hes the Third Seat on Zarakis Squad, Ikkaku Madarame Hes the second strongest man on Squad 11, Soul Societys most powerful squad Y-Youre from this afternoon! Dont you have to go to his aid Arent you his fellow officer! Why dont you understand Huh Look at that happy face Ikkaku is having fun Its been a while since hes faced such a formidable opponent Go to his aid doesnt apply to us Its more like, cant go to his aid Can you understand No, I dont understand Having fun Cant go to his aid Then is there a guarantee that hell win - Nope - What is that! What if your comrade dies Whatll you do! Thats obvious Be happy for him His style is rough, but his strength is certain He provokes a reaction However He attacks with his sword in his left hand and defends with the sheathe in his right So naive Since Ive ascertained that he only attacks with his left I can instantly differentiate between his attack stance and defense stance Which means I can easily find an opening! He attacks with his left! His sheathe is in his left hand! Damn, I missed I intended to cut your head off What kind of guy is he Deceiving me into thinking his offense was simple, making me think his attack patterns are predictable, and creating an opening for me Then the instant I attack, he switches the sheathe to his left What a haphazard way of fighting Its full of flaws Even if his blows are powerful, if hes unlucky, he dies He doesnt fight to win He fights because he enjoys it! At first glance, he looks like hes thinking through his moves But thats not so He fights as though killing is a game This guy considers his own life as just a tool for battle That huge slap technique with all that Spiritual Pressure in your hand is amazing I lost two teeth cuz of that Well, never mind Ill get Akon to make me some cheap replacements later All right Ready for the second round! Ive just about learned your moves Five, maybe six exchanges And Ill force you to release your zanpakuto! I see It seems I underestimated you For someone like you, its not whether its necessary or not I should just release my zanpakuto to fight you, right Are you acknowledging my strength then No I just think that a fool like you, who loves to fight, needs to be taught a lesson about what its like to feel uncontrollable fear in the depths of your bones So that you never again think that fighting an Arrancar is fun Awaken! Volcanica! Whatsthat Whats that is all you can say Huh This is what we Arrancars call releasing our zanpakuto! Bad This is really bad! I think you said in your protocol that you tell your name to the man you intend to kill Im Arrancar Trece, Edrad Liones! What is this guys Spiritual Pressure! Hes an Arrancar, too Is he really the same as that one earlier! The level of Spiritual Pressure is way too different! Which one Im asking which is the stronger one This is bad! Ichigo, lets retreat for now! I guess this isnt the one D-Damn it Rukia! The zanpakuto of Arrancars has the nucleus of our power sealed into the sword It is completely different from the swords of Soul Reapers In other words, the release of the sword signifies the release of ourselves and our power Do you understand This appearance is my true self And this Volcanica is my true strength! Yes, Yumichika Ayasegawa, what is your request The enemys destructive power has magnified to unexpected proportions Requesting an area freeze for a radius of 300 units around Ikkaku Madarame Yes Several souls may become entangled in this As for the buildings, take it out from our mission allowance as usual The safety of the souls is the top priority Roger I would expect the same increase in power from the other assailants Toshiro Hitsugaya, Rangiku Matsumoto, Renji Abarai, Rukia Kuchiki, and Ichigo Kurosaki Request the same area freeze for them as well Also Prepare a Squad Funeral for Ikkaku Madarame Funeral Does that mean you think hes gonna die! Whats wrong When an Arrancar releases his zanpakuto, his battle strength increases exponentially! Spiritual Pressure of your level can never withstand it! Extend! Hozukimaru! Is it over Give it up Knowing when its over is also a fine trait in a warrior You fought well I dont want to have to beat you to a pulp How unfortunate Sheesh I never expected this much difference in strength Well, it cant be helped Right now, everyone else has their hands full with their own enemy So no one will notice Well well I really didnt expect to use it in a place like this! Watch carefully And dont tell anyone about this Bankai! Wh-What! Whats going on! I see So hes using it Did you sayBankai Yeah, I did Bankai Ryumon Hozukimaru! Thats pretty awesome Dont flatter me Theres not enough Spiritual Pressure yet for you to be impressed You can decide whether its awesome or not after youre dead! Impossible He cut through my Volcanica! Power! His Bankai doesnt increase his Kido, his speed or his defensive abilities but it doesnt increase speed or defensive power Its an accumulation of sheer power Amazing destructive power However, relying only on that power makes him slow to counter my attacks! I have the will to win! I have no fear! Before he can cut off my arms I will surpass his strength and kill him! It will be power versus power! I cannot lose! Strange That zanpakuto The Spiritual Pressure has gone up even more! Seems you noticed Unlike me, Hozukimaru likes to take his time Even after Bankai, he continues to sleep So my opponent and I have to keep exchanging vicious blows to force him to wake up or else, the power wont manifest But when he starts to wake up the dragon starts to turn red And when its all dyed red, for the first time, Ryumon Hozukimaru reaches ultimate strength Here I come! Sure! I met you at age 16 and we had an eternal love Beneath cherry blossoms petals gently fluttering downward That steep and sunny hill where I ran up to see you, And our shadows at the corner of the park, they are still unchanged even today You, me, and cherry blossom days, we dance and sway in the wind Holding in our heart the unseen future, we look up at the pink sky Its time for Professor Grimmjows lecture on Arrancars The words in front of our names are numbers Seis means six Trece is thirteen Thisll be on the test, so remember it! Professor! Whats 15 Fifteen Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers Err, Captain I have a favor to ask Even if Im away, you dont have to attend the Lieutenants Meeting Captains are responsible for the duties of their lieutenants I know, but If Rukia is away, do you plan to attend the Women Soul Reaper Association Meeting"

Even if Ive shown you the full might of my strength, you face me and dont run away Wonderful! It truly is! You say your name is Shawlong Qufang I want to ask you one thing You called yourself Arrancar Undécimo Undécimo It means that youre the eleventh Does that mean that youre the eleventh strongest of the Arrancar No Our numbers are not a strength hierarchy, but our order of birth But only for those below me Let me make this easy to explain When we are changed from Hollow to Arrancar, we are given numbers from eleven onwards by order of our birth Those of us with especially outstanding killing abilities are given the numbers 1 through 10 by order of our abilities These chosen ten are called the Espada The number they were given is branded somewhere on their body and they are given the authority to control us lower numbers I shall make this clear The strength of the Espada is in a different league than ours Furthermore, one of those Espada is with us right now He has been given the number six by Lord Aizen Seis Espada Grimmjow Jeagerjaques Crap!

Oh, I see Too bad Its fine with me But why is it okay! Hes a complete stranger! Its dangerous! Think it over more carefully! Its all right I am the older sister who kindly accommodates the total stranger whom my young brother brings home without asking any questions Thats the kind of sister I want to become Shut up! I dont care what kind of sister you want to be in the future! Or rather, I love men with buzz cuts Thats totally the only obvious reason! For that matter, he doesnt have a buzz cut Hes bald! Huh! Im not bald either Yesyoure right Im sorry Dammit! Whatis this guy! Sheesh You call this your Bankai Dont disappoint me, will ya, Soul Reaper! You used your Bankai and the only thing that improved was your speed Huh! Getsugatensho! What was that trick just now Ulquiorra didnt say anything about that in his report, Soul Reaper! So maybe I wont disappoint you, huh, Arrancar! Now were talking, Soul Reaper Finallyyoure worth killing! Ichigo! What are you laughing at Youre sure taking your time Huh Hold it Im almost there Humph what can you do alone Dammit! His wounds arent that deep! He got hit with my Getsugatensho head on, and thats all the damage he gets The Black Getsugatensho is originally his technique If I use it, hell manifest himself more quickly I can only make two or three shots while under my control Whatll I do! Hey, how long are you gonna stand there, Soul Reaper! Ichigo Now its my turn! Put down your sword Grimmjow Tosen! Tosen! The captain who disappeared with Aizen! Why are you here!

The one whos life was spared because of this was yours, Soul Reaper! I can tell just from your current state That earlier technique also damages you as well You probably had another two or three shots left, right But even if you were able to use it infinitely you wouldnt beat me in my released state! Released state Dont forget my name! And pray that you never hear it again! Grimmjow Jeagerjaques! The next time you hear my name will mean your end, Soul Reaper! Have the Arrancars returned to Hueco Mundo Did you win I lost You fool The fact that youre alive means its a win Dont lie If you were me you wouldnt say that I havent been able to protect anyone I havent even been able to bring down the one who hurt my friends I lost Grimmjow K-Kisuke Kisuke Its okay, Ururu Welcome back Grimmjow I dressed up my five fingers with a manicure And then whats glowing was me instead Inspiration is like a goldfish Or perhaps a voice Theres no sound that doesnt bounce back Those lines stretching parallel to each other They say one line turns beautiful, then deteriorate repeatedly Im standing right there,  but the way is locked The distance grows,  but its within reach And even today I trace your gibberish roman letters over and over with my left hand The one you see the moment you open your eyes What color will he paint your nails It seems the Arrancars use some sort of nerve radar called Pesquisa to search out Spiritual Pressure Ichigo, if you had something like that, youd be able to find our hide-out Shut up!

Move! I told you, put up five more! ButI couldnt do it in time! Oh well, never mind Ichigo, let me say one thing Youve got this all wrong Wrong Its true were trying to recruit you However, its not something for you to decide What do you mean The power to choose is on our side Whether you want to join, or not Thats not the issue We look at your power Then its whether we really want you or not Thats all Think about your position carefully! You dont have the right to choose! If you have the power, we will make you one of us Well teach you how to suppress your Hollow However, if you have no power, who cares! Youll disappear to wherever, become a Hollow, and die a shameful death!

Are you stupid! Or rather, am I stupid for rowing on it like you told me to! Thats right! Youre stupid!

Im bound to row on this thing for three days or even a week! I can tell after rowing on it all day! A person expends an incredible amount of spirit energy just by touching it Thats what its made to do! Your plan is to see how many days itll take for me to collapse, so you can measure my maximum spirit energy capacity, isnt it! But with my current spirit energy, Ill definitely go for at least five days! Theres no point in measuring! Teach me how to control my Hollow transformation! I dont have time! I dont have time to be playing around with you Visored! Shut up!

Whats this How do you know about the Hogyoku We know about the Hogyoku, the Arrancars, and Sosuke Aizen Weve known all about them for many, many years Ill tell you the details another day I thought that I should take my time and get your soul prepared our way But when I think about it You became a Soul Reaper, got your Shikai, and got your Bankai at incredible speed How do you know about that I see As you say, it might be better for you if we just teach you how to transform into a Hollow Here I go, Ichigo Dont regret it Hachi, build a double barrier Yes Can you hear me, Ichigo Right now, you are going to undergo a complete Hollow transformation Dont get eaten! Consume it! If you get eaten up its all over Hachi, place a barrier here, too What Dont say that! Its not cute when an old man says it!

Dont make me keep saying it! ImZangetsu! Ichigo Im not sure if you know but Zangetsu and I ere one to begin with Both Zangetsu and I are your power I was a part of Zangetsu Even though we all share a single body, outlooks change depending on whos in control If life is in control, you have flesh If death is in control, you become bones Its the same reasoning My power has increased, control has switched over to me, and Zangetsu has become a part of me The more you try to draw out Zangetsus power, the easier its become to control your soul! Is that so Then that means that if I defeat you here, old man Zangetsu will become the center of my power once more You Defeat me Thats impossible You think so Tell me its impossible after seeing this! You just dont understand Im telling you its impossible Ban - kai! - kai!

Stand upIchigo Kurosaki In that case Byakuya! You bastard Youre being stubborn! What do you want Ichigo Kurosaki It seems that it is impossible for you to obtain a true Bankai What the hell are you talking about Im in the state of Bankai right now! You bastard! Stop talking nonsense! Those who have no will to fight cannot stop my sword Its over Dont get so annoyed! Lets have fun! Shut up! What was that just now Why did Byakuya appear! Damn Whats going on Dont get careless at a time like this! Im not getting careless! With a look like that on your face, how can you say that youre not getting careless! I said that Im not getting careless! Getsugatensho! He stopped it with one hand! Getsugatensho! 21 That makes ten minutes Hachi! Time to switch! Open it up! All right Its time! Trade off!

Youre really quite pathetic, boy Huh Kariya How long do I have to rest There are eight of us in all, and were rotating, so ten minutes times eight is 80 minutes! It isnt times eight, baldy! If you exclude her, its seven! Ten minutes times seven is 70 minutes then! My job is to set the barrier, but Im still included He was strong! Far more than I thought he would be Be careful, Kensei If you dont Instant Regeneration! Whats this Hes pretty serious You understand the situation best, dont you Wha! What! Tsk! His Hollow transformation is unexpectedly fast The maximum amount of time he can take in his Visored Training to control his Hollow transformation is about one hour Excluding Hachigen, ten minutes times six is 60 minutes That means that when my turn comes around again Its over Kariya This is a hallucination This is a hallucination! It might be But What is it The mind sees hallucinations Since your mind created me, it means that youre concerned about the fact that you defeated me You always look back whenever you finish a battle You look at the foe you defeated and the friends you couldnt protect Are you that afraid to move forward through battle Are you afraid to walk the same path as me No! Im not like you! Youre pretty confident What happened to your Zangetsu Do you think that you can defeat me with your bare hands Youve lost your Zangetsu Do you know how helpless you are Youre as defenseless as a scared baby! Damn it! Do you want a weapon that badly! Then Ill give you one! This is Old man Zangetsu! Sorry Its me You want a weapon, dont you Choose whichever one you like No! Zangetsu isnt here! Remember! Zangetsu is Whats wrong Arent you going to take a weapon How are you going to repel this! Its within me Zangetsu! Now you cant say whatever you like! Getting a weapon has made you confident Youre really pathetic Shut up! Then cut me down with that! Wha! You cannot cut me with that blade that regrets cutting me down Ill tell you the truth The truth about battle Battles go on forever Even if you defeat one person, another strong person will appear And even if you defeat him, an even stronger person will appear If you dont have the determination to withstand that everlasting struggle, you will lose someday But it doesnt end there Someone else will repeat the battles Its a cycle of rebirth! Its not limited to the life and death of people! Battle has its own cycle of rebirth! As long as peoples souls exist, conflicts will be born and battles will begin Battles will repeat themselves throughout eternity! Thats not true! Thats why youre foolish! Those with power will always be drawn into battle It was the same for us Bounts The ones who are first to lose their lives are idealists like you! Damn it! Youre still fighting with a weak blade like this one Dont you have any pride How boring Z-Zangetsu is Its not Zangetsu I told you that Im Zangetsu As usual, youre amazingly stupid! Youve lost your weapon Why are you just standing there Ichigo! Whats the difference between a king and his horse What I dont mean, ones a person and the others a horse, or one has two legs and the other has four Im not giving you a kids riddle! Form, abilities, and power! Even if the two were exactly the same, one would be the king who controls the battle, and the other would be the horse that lends its power to the king Im asking you what the difference is between them! Theres only one answer Its instinct! Its the thing that someone with equal power needs in order to gain even greater power! What someone needs to become the king is The desire to engage in battle, and to obtain power And the desire to mercilessly crush and trample your enemies The absolute desire to engage in battle! Our sharp, murderous instincts are etched deep in the core of our bodies! You have no raw instinct! You fight with reason You try to defeat your foes with reason! Who can you cut with a sheathed sword! Thats why youre weaker than I am, Ichigo! I dont want that, Ichigo I dont know about Zangetsu, but I dont want a king whos weaker than I am to ride around on me and get us both killed! Youre weak, so Ill crush you Then Ill become the king Instinct To desire to engage in battle Sword I wont give it to him SWORD Sword Instinct I dressed up my five fingers with a manicure And then whats glowing was me instead Inspiration is like a goldfish Or perhaps a voice Theres no sound that doesnt bounce back Those lines stretching parallel to each other They say one line turns beautiful, then deteriorate repeatedly Im standing right there,  but the way is locked The distance grows,  but its within reach And even today I trace your gibberish roman letters over and over with my left hand The one you see the moment you open your eyes What color will he paint your nails Ichigo seems like hes having fun in his internal battle Do you suppose hes having a really good dream Men always have perverted dreams What!

BATTLE  	   	You instinctively desire battle Because there is no other way to gain power Fight, Ichigo! If you want the power to control Take your sword and cut down your enemies! There is no other path Before youor behind you Ichigo! BATTLE Its a Cero! Love! I know! Are you going to use your Hollow transformation, Love! Of course! Even he cant block that Without using a Hollow transformation, he wont be able to avoid that Spiritual Pressure! Whats this! Hachi! Let Love out of the barrier! Crap It seems like some of it remained Your instinct for battle I have no choice You defeated me I will accept you as the king But dont forget that either one of us can become the king or the horse If you leave me even the slightest opening I will toss you out and stomp on your skull! This is a warning If you really want to control my power, then be sure not to die until the next time I appear! Hachi Yes Do you suppose Berry is all right, Hachi Shh How do you feel Not bad I see Dont forget If you leave me even the slightest opening I will toss you out and stomp on your skull! Sorry I wont let you Kurosaki didnt come to school today either after all If I focus like this I can sense his Spiritual Pressure I know that hes well But, knowing Kurosaki, hes probably training somewhere in secret Its probably best not to look for him I wonder if Kurosaki disappeared without saying anything to Kuchiki OH!  	   	   	   	   	   	   	   	   	Oh! Wh-What was that just now! How gloomy! Im being gloomy! What should I do during my break tomorrow! Oh yeah! Ill invite Tatsuki to go eat something interesting!

Oh! Im back, Mrs Shinmura! Come to think of it, those two people who keep visiting your room are they really all right Why do you ask Well, they carried something very strange into your room Huh Woah Thats so cool - I mean What is this, Toshiro! - Tsk! - She came back at a bad time - Whats all this! Thank you for waiting This is the Department of Research and Developments communication technology lab This is the Squad 10 Captain, Toshiro Hitsugaya All right, Ill connect you H-Head Captain Youre quick as usual, Captain Hitsugaya I had you prepare this emergency channel because we have determined Sosuke Aizens true goal Aizens true goal! Yes, indeed Um This looks like its something important, so Ill just step out! Wait This concerns you humans, too Listen to what I have to say Okay Its been several months since Aizen has disappeared As you know, were investigating the Squad 5 captains room, where Aizen lived, Central 46s underground assembly hall and Seijoto Kyorin, Immaculate Tower Grove where he hid himself, as well as the Daireisho Archive Upon investigation of the Daireisho Archive, Ukitake found traces of something inside Hey, youre working hard Kyoraku, huh Why are you here We have some free time, so we came to help I hope well be of help Thanks Captain! We found traces of Captain Aizens Spiritual Pressure! I shall put it on your monitor! This isthe Hogyoku and research data related to it Well, Sosuke was after the Hogyoku, so I guess that makes sense Captain Ukitake! Take a look at this! This is information completely unrelated to the Hogyoku This is What was the information that Aizen was looking at-- The Ouken, the royal key Umm What is the Royal Key As its name suggests, its the key to the royal family Soul Society has a royal family too We have a king, but he leaves Soul Society to us It doesnt feel as if he exists My captain and I have never actually seen him in person Indeed Our king is called the Soul King He is a symbolic, as well as an absolute, presence in Soul Society His Royal Palace is in a different space within Soul Society It is guarded by the Royal Secret Service The Ouken, the royal key, is the key to the space where the Royal Palace is Then Aizen wants the king Dead Thats probably his goal But thats not the problem The book Aizen was looking at doesnt reveal where the Royal Key is Indeed Each successive Head Captain of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads passes down the whereabouts of the Royal Key by word of mouth Therefore, there is no book that tells of its whereabouts He was looking at a document that describes the circumstances in which the key was created He discovered how to create the Royal Key The Ouken Codex The materials needed for its creation are 100,000 souls and an Enriched Spirit Zone that is greater than a radius of one spirit mile An Enriched Spirit Zone is an unusually spiritual place within the World of the Living Its location changes over time and is the easiest place in the World of the Living for spiritual entities to gather Nanao, where is the Enriched Spirit Zone right now Oh, okay! Hold on one moment This is The Enriched Spirit Zone that Aizen is after is Karakura Town One hundred thousand souls and an Enriched Spirit Zone that has a radius of one spirit mile is so beyond reality that it is difficult to grasp Ill explain it in simple terms If Aizen completes the Royal Key in the way that it has been documented Karakura Town, as well as all the nearby land and people, will be ripped away from the world and will disappear N-No way Is there Is there a way to stop that We would stop him even if there werent a way That is why the Thirteen Court Guard Squads exist We still have a short amount of time According to Kurotsuchis report, after being released from a seal within a soul, the Hogyoku is in a deep sleep No matter what methods he uses, it will take four months until it fully awakens Unless the Hogyoku awakens, Aizen cannot gather his minions Hell make his move after that The showdown will be in winter! Until then, we must hone our skills And prepare for battle! Yes! And Orihime Inoue Aizen is after the World of the Living We might not be able to handle it by ourselves We need help from the World of the Living Yes Could you tell Ichigo Kurosaki Yes! I shall inform Ikkaku and the others Ill go, too Oh Wait one moment, Captain Hitsugaya Theres someone whos been waiting here to talk to you You Whats wrong Are you finished, Yasutora Sado! Its still a little too bright to be sleeping, dont you think Im not finished! Thats right! Everyone Kurosaki I dressed up my five fingers with a manicure And then whats glowing was me instead Inspiration is like a goldfish Or perhaps a voice Theres no sound that doesnt bounce back Those lines stretching parallel to each other They say one line turns beautiful, then deteriorate repeatedly Im standing right there,  but the way is locked The distance grows,  but its within reach And even today I trace your gibberish roman letters over and over with my left hand The one you see the moment you open your eyes What color will he paint your nails Orihime, since weve got such a huge monitor, want to rent something I want to watch a comedian DVD! Sounds good! This isnt meant to be used that way Ill rent a kids anime that you might like Matsumoto THE ARRANCAR ENCYCLOPEDIA  	   	   	   	   	   	   	   	   	The Arrancar Encyclopedia! From today, I will kindly teach you about the Arrancar The Arrancars are Hollows who have transformed when their masks were removed But you cant predict what will be born when their masks are taken off! Its kind of like gambling Its amusing, dont you think, Gin You really like that kind of stuff, dont you"
" Your pale broken wings Are just a bit tired from that clear blue sky You dont need to force your smiles for someone Its okay now to smile for yourself Loneliness still continues to stalk me A candle lit within The party is lively; the chandeliers are gorgeous, and yet How do I fill the hole left behind by those lacking words I dont even know anymore If I can at least swim freely in my dreams, I wouldnt need a sky like that I can face tomorrow without painting over all the things up to yesterday Your pale broken wings Are just a bit tired from that clear blue sky You dont need to force your smiles for someone Its okay now to smile for yourself Soul Reapers They are the spiritual guardians of the World of the Living They are the balancers who keep a close eye on the countless souls, good and evil, that fill this world While visiting the Visoreds, Ichigo, after intense Visored Training, finally succeeds in suppressing his inner Hollow Meanwhile, conducting his investigation at the Daireisho Archives, Ukitake finds a possible clue to Aizens goal In order to kill the Soul Societys Royal Family, Aizen attempts to create the Ouken, the key to enter the palace And to do so he needs 100,000 souls, and an Enriched Spirit Zone in the radius of one spirit mile In other words, Karakura Town, as well as all the nearby land and people, will be ripped away from the world and will disappear Wait one moment, Captain Hitsugaya Theres someone whos been waiting here to talk to you You Hitsugaya I see Youve awakened, Hinamori Is it all right for you to be walking around already YesIm all right now! I see You dont look like youre all right, you idiot Im sorry Im sorry, Hitsugaya for not believing in you There was something wrong with me for pointing my sword at you I really You idiot That wont bother me forever It doesnt bother me, so dont let it bother you Get some sleep already Get rid of those bags under your eyes Okay Thank you, Hitsugaya Besides Youre still like a kid If you dont get a lot more sleep than other people, youll stop growing! Take a look at Matsumoto! You wont be able to catch up to her unless you sleep for at least ten years! Sh-Shut up! Rangiku is different! Besides, Hitsugaya, you of all people shouldnt talk to me about growing! Hinamori! Dont make me repeat myself Its not Hitsugaya, its Captain Hitsugaya Yeah Thats right Say Can I ask you something, Hitsugaya What is it Are you going to fight Captain Aizen Are you going to kill him Please Save Captain Aizen! What Captain Aizen is doing is bad But Im sure that he has a good reason for it Thats right! Im sure that Captain Aizen is being forced by Captain Ichimaru, or someone else, into doing Sorry I let her talk out of respect for her wishes but it seems that its still too early No Thank you very much Captain Hitsugaya Excuse me Aizen! Whats wrong! Your powers dropping! Thats nottrue! Huh! Help Sado out with his training! Why me! It doesnt seem like hell leave if I turn him down Youre not answering my question! Why not! Its not such a big deal Thats right! You must be big-hearted Stay out of this, outsiders! He asked you, didnt he Then you should help him! You need the power of a Bankai to train Sado Then, even more so, you should do it! You have a Bankai, dont you! OH COME ON!  	     	   	   	   	   	   	   	Oh, come on! A mere handsome 	and perverted shopkeeper like me OH COME ON!  	     	   	   	   	   	   	   	   	would never be able to use a Bankai! OH COME ON!  	  	     	   	   	   	   	   	   	Dont you know the details 	of whats happening! OH COME ON!  	  	     	   	   	   	   	   	   	Ive known for some time now that 	you used to be the Squad 12 captain and that you were the one who created the Hogyoku! Eww, gross! Thats why people say that young people these days have no manners! Thats right! Shut up! Anyway, he asked you! You do it! Just listen to him, Ururu Hes just a freeloader But, in the end, he doesnt have any manly spirit Yeah He really doesnt do anything As they say, Those who dont work dont eat! Thats right! Shut up! I wont fall for that! Youre the same, too! Anyway I wont be any good My Bankai isnt good for training people or helping people All right! I understand! Lets do this! Huh Abarai, you have something you want to ask me, right Y-Yeah Lets make a deal If you do routine chores around here for three months, Ill answer any of your questions! H-Helping with training isnt a routine chore! It is! Youre still putting in effort and risking your life! Or will you give up asking me what you want to know He was so resistant But Abarai is really getting into it Come on! You cant get strong if you just run away! Dont underestimate me! Sado, your power still has room for growth You should be able to move on to the next step if you keep fighting against a Bankai Theres just one concern Your power is different from that of a Soul Reaper or a Quincy Yes Its as if your power is I told you not to undo your Hollow transformation! What are you, stupid! It was dangerous if I hadnt! Shut up! Baldy! Shut up! Going as far as you can is your training! What! If you want to fool around, then quit! Those two are getting along unexpectedly well Yeah There A cat is walking across that wide area as if theres a rim around it The birds and the other animals dont approach it No They cant approach it Thats becausetheres a barrier here What an incredible barrier But why This is such a powerful barrier, but its kind of like my Shunshunrikka shield I can do this! Hurry up, Ichigo! One more time! Shut up! I got it already! That hurts! I keep telling you that the first move you make after you take out your mask is slow! If you get hitits over! The time he can maintain that state isnt getting any longer Well, he wont make immediate progress Four seconds Thats quick! Say, say, why is Berry doing this This is the training to remain in his Hollow form for long periods of time! You did it too, remember I didnt do that What You liar Its true Mashiro was able to remain in her Hollow form for 15 hours from the beginning Shes the only one who didnt train to maintain a Hollow transformation Really I forgot about that See! Stupid Kensei, you grouch! Why you Now, now Whats wrong, Hachi Someone has passed through my barrier and entered this building Is it a Soul Reaper No The Hachigyo Sogai placed around here is a technique I created when I became a Visored Its impossible to disperse it with Soul Reaper kido Then who is it! Is it a Visored like us! I dont know Whats most confusing is that the intruder didnt destroy my barrier, but passed through it I dont think even a Visored could do that Then who in the world is this intruder Its coming - A - A human! Oh Umm S-Sorry Wheres the bathroom Just kidding Huh! She said that she was kidding Its a joke Dont get mad, Kensei I wouldnt say I was kidding in this situation What are you doing, Ichigo! Crap! Kurosaki! Inoue! I see So thats whats happening now What is it N-Nothing I was just thinking that you arent very surprised I am surprised But when Im suddenly told about something like this Ouken, the royal key, my mind cant keep up Dont look so worried, Inoue Itll be all right Ill stop Aizen I can still get stronger I can sense it Thank you for informing me, Inoue All right! Lets begin training again, Hiyori! Its Ms Hiyori, baldy! - I know - I see Kurosaki wasnt surprised, not because his mind couldnt keep up Its because hes getting stronger It doesnt matter what his enemies goals are Kurosaki only focuses on his own strength and what needs to be done The surprise doesnt shake his heart Kurosaki is really getting stronger And he isnt dark and scary like before But its not just in a gentle way Its a strange feeling Tsk! Who was that woman! She just talked to Ichigo and then left It seemed like she was Ichigos friend That girlis Orihime Huh! Whats this, Shinji! You know her! Orihime is my first love Thats a blatant lie! Shinji, you always say that to cute girls! You even said that to me! Is she implying that shes cute He says that to all cute girls! Thats odd! Hes never said that to me! Cause I didnt say it to you, idiot! Dont look the other way! Hachi Yes Your barrier is perfect Theres no mistaking that Yes So how could that girl, Orihime, find this place And furthermore, how could she get in I dont know for certain But my impression of her Spiritual Pressure up close She has the same type of barrier-making abilities that I have Thats what I sensed Its probably because of that ability that she was able to detect this place while it was in a barrier, as well as pass through my barrier I never expected a human to have that kind of ability Its a little hard to believe So here you are, Inoue Yoruichi! Kisuke asked me to find you Mr Urahara He wanted me to take you to his training ground immediately Tilt the goblet to the west, Wolke! Youre still hiding Gintô Youre pretty cautious It sounds like youre calling me a coward Thats right Whats wrong! You call that running away! Your dodging speed is getting slower! Is this your limit! My limit Hes right My arms and legs cant move much anymore But his Spiritual Pressure is definitely getting weaker He said that my power would come back if I kept dodging arrows, but there is still no sign of that I dont know how much of what he told me was a lie But hell kill me at this rate Im at my limit Ive got to stop his movements and end this training! And my only chance is Now! My final Gintô! The silver whip strikes the five-fingered stone bed! Gritz! All right! Too bad Its over He got me Crap! To wear down both mind and body to its limits and take a shot from a spirit bow 19 mm to the right of your hearts sinoatrial node Thats the only way to regain the powers you lost from Quincy Letz Stile Honestly Why did you use a Gritz there If you used a Haizen, you could have at least injured me Thats why I say youre stupid It makes me sick ButIll let that slide for today I dressed up my five fingers with a manicure And then whats glowing was me instead Inspiration is like a goldfish Or perhaps a voice Theres no sound that doesnt bounce back Those lines stretching parallel to each other They say one line turns beautiful, then deteriorate repeatedly Im standing right there,  but the way is locked The distance grows,  but its within reach And even today I trace your gibberish roman letters over and over with my left hand The one you see the moment you open your eyes What color will he paint your nails Kurosaki, are you going to continue training Yeah Ill get stronger if I stay here Well train him on his sense of humor too! When he leaves, hell be a splendid Kansai Comedian! Wow Hes being taught genuine comedy! Im so jealous! Why! The Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! Abarai, clean this room too! Quickly! After we let Sado rest for half an hour, were going to start his training again! I know! Hes getting him to do general chores in addition to training Sado Urahara really is good at that He tricked him Red Pineapple, really is stupid Stupid"
" So here you are, Inoue Yoruichi! Kisuke asked me to find you Mr Urahara He wanted me to take you to his training ground immediately Thats so cute! That girls got unbelievable fashion sense! Shut up! How long are you going to keep making noise! M-M-M-M-Matsumoto! Where did you come from! The entrance The doors unlocked Youre staying in a pretty unsafe place That aside Have your tastes changed since you came here This is something I got from the owner of the house! You wear clothes prepared by the owner of the house! Of course! I get a free bed and free meals I cant complain about what to wear! Really Id loudly complain about the food and the clothes! Hey Whos the poor guy shes staying with Its that girl, Orihime Its none of our business, but I really feel sorry for her Hello Im home Ikkaku, Yumichika, how areyou Yahoo! Is this a dream, or is this real Its the second coming of the Breast Goddess! You underestimate me Im Keigo Asano! The same technique wont hit me twice Hey He only pounced at you Theres no need to go that far Oh! Sorry I kind of got carried away Im home, darling! Were you a good boy! Sorry I went into the wrong room Hey! No I didnt! You made me do something corny! Who are you! Is everyone in this house like this Things are going to get complicated, - so do what you came to do and just leave - Hey! Dont ignore me! - What in the world did you come here for - Hey, you! Get out of here! Hello Inoue, long time no see! Um Seriously Lately, Ive been surrounded by two smelly guys, so it really is cheery when a woman is in the workplace! Oh So Im not counted as a woman Oh, come now, Yoruichi I was talking about here in this basement! Because of you, the shop upstairs is quite cheery! What an interesting way to put it Come on Inoue, sit right here! Oh Okay Sado Renji Theyre loud as usual Urahara! He cant go on anymore! Im going to wrap up for today! Sado! Tessai! Ururu! Lirin! Wake Sado up! Leave it to me! Hell recover as soon as I sprinkle this magic water on him! Sado, youre only slightly injured! Stay conscious! Were with you! No problem W-Wait I can still do this! Dont act too tough No problem Its a big problem! Enigmatic are the ways of Heaven Even things you think you can do may lead to tragedy afterwards! You must let us treat your body Hey! Nobodys listening to me You talk too much! You bastard Ow ow ow ow ow Whoa Im surprised he hasnt died Give it your best! Mr Urahara Umm What did you want to talk to me about Earlier, Matsumoto of Squad 10 came here Huh! You know about the Ouken, the royal key, dont you This is sudden and kind of unexpected But whatever the case, both Soul Society and we are preparing for the upcoming battle in winter Itll be an all-out war More blood will probably be shed than ever before And both Soul Society and we will also need more power than we have ever had before Yes Itll be all right Ill stop Aizen I can still get stronger I can sense it I want to become strong, too! Whats wrong Do you want to stop Not yet! I thought so Then Ill tell you Inoue I want you to sit this battle out Huh Tsubaki He still hasnt recovered since he was destroyed in your battle with the Arrancar, has he No I cant even find a trace of him He was smashed to pieces I dont even know how to fix him Tsubaki is your only method of attack Without him, I cannot allow you to participate in combat Its the only logical thing to do Wait, Mr Urahara! Inoue is our friend! She desperately fought in Soul Society and against the Bounts! Sado She says she wants to get stronger, so we cant leave her out so easily! Thats an emotionally charged argument Do you want Inoue to die No! Inoue has more important abilities than fighting She has defensive and healing powers! The Santenkesshuns defensive power isnt that good It probably wont be of much use in this battle And we have Squad 4 for healing This time, even Captain Unohana and Lieutenant Kotetsu will probably be on the front lines There are more than enough people who can fill the space that Inoue leaves behind But Youre being stubborn Im saying that a warrior whos lost her powers is just a burden on everyone else Mr Urahara! Its okay Inoue Its all right Thank you, Sado Thank you very much, Mr Urahara Im glad you gave it to me straight Excuse me! Inoue! Wait Abarai Dont Mr Urahara is right Even though Squad 4 specializes in medical treatment, theyre still Thirteen Court Guard Squad members Theyre trained in combat But even though Inoue has her abilities, shes still an ordinary human Add her personality to that She was never meant for battle This might be a good time to put it behind her Inoue She left Orihime Inoue Whats wrong Why are you in a rush K-Kuchiki Huh! H-Hey, whats wrong, Inoue! Inoue! What! Urahara said that I cant forgive him No Its all right I sort of calmed down after talking to you This is for the best Im sure of it Its true, Im not powerful enough Its not okay! Youve been fighting all this time! Arent you mad that you were cut off so easily! I-Im not mad Dont lie! Im not lying! Im not mad! But Im just sad that I cant fight with everyone! But what I hate more than being sad is becoming a burden on everyone If Im going to become a burden on Kurosaki and everyone else, Id rather be sad Listen, Inoue Its not those without power who are a burden in battle Its those who lack determination! None of us have been a burden in any of our battles Ichigo, Sado, Ishida, everyone else, and you, Inoue Without even one of you I wouldnt be here right now There should be something you can do to prepare for the showdown Lets look for that together, Inoue Kuchiki Wha--! H-Hiyori! Im taking you with me! Hachi has business with you! Hachi Wh-Who is she! Ow ow ow Hachi, this is what you wanted, right! Inoue All right, Ichigo! Your break is over! Wait a sec! What do you want with Inoue I said that break-time is over! You bastard! I am Hachi, otherwise known as, Hachigen Ushoda Pleased to meet you P-Pleased to meet you Hmm Hmm U-Umm What did you want to see me about - Hmm - Ow ow ow ow ow ow! Youre pulling it off Youre pulling it off - Hmm - Youre going to pull off my head! Ow ow ow ow I thought so! This hairpin is the source of your power Its like a Zanpakuto! Very unusual! But its cracked Ive been wondering about that ever since you came in earlier Yes I cant fix it Its been smashed into pieces Shall I fix it R-Really! Of course! All right! Thank you very much! Its nothing All right Let go of her head already I dont understand! Why is Hachi suddenly fixing that girls weapon Who is that girl She just came out of nowhere I dont like her! Shes annoying! Shes annoying! - Quit your yapping! - No, no, no, no! - Yap! Yap! Yap! - Hes probably happy We dont really get to meet people who have the same powers that we do He probably feels like his family has expanded Hachi As well as Thats not good enough! I see He was smashed into oblivion So he cant be fixed Thats why you were left out Is that it Umm Its not quite like that, but Ive already explained this five times, so thats good enough But thats odd From what I can see of your Spiritual Pressure, your power is very similar to mine If thats the case, he should be able to return to his original form even if he was smashed to pieces Huh What is it, woman Why do you look like that - All right! Im so glad, Tsubaki! - Whoa! What are you doing! - Thank goodness! - Let me go! Thank you, Hachi! - Im really glad, Tsubaki! - Hey! Let go of me! Orihime Yes I have fixed Tsubaki Now you can go back to the battlefront But I also do not recommend that you fight Since your power is like mine, you are definitely not meant for battle Especially against the Arrancars Even so, do you still want to fight Yes! I want to fight! Then thats fine You still dont know everything about your power You should have a way to fight Keep this in mind Whats important is not what things should be like, but how you want them to be Okay! Kuchiki! - Kuchiki! Inside, its actually - It doesnt matter Dont say anymore Huh Upon coming here, I faintly sensed Ichigos Spiritual Pressure If he didnt say anything about it, he probably had his reasons Its good enough that hes safe Lets go, Inoue Kurosaki Im weak, and I always feel like Im looking back at you But right now, Im going to go forward without looking back When we meet again, Ill be able to fight without looking at your back Lets go, Kuchiki! That you, Ulquiorra What do you want Youre all better Im glad I brought your arm back just in case Its taking too long! My arms going to rot It would be easier if our bodies automatically recovered, just like your eye does! Dont complain At least its attached If your arm had been entirely destroyed like what happened to Grimmjow, you would have been dropped from the Espada Thats true Im finished treating your arm All right How is it Is there any difference in movement or responses than before All right Its no good If I were at my best, she would have been blown into pieces How silly Oh well Itll get better sooner or later Ill get my revenge on that Soul Reaper when it does! You have an interesting abilitywoman Captain! Kuchiki has called saying that shes going to temporarily return to Soul Society with a friend! All right Lets prepare for their welcome! Yes! Ive already mentioned it to the squad and suggested preparing for a welcoming party! Dont forget to cook the rice Yes! Are you guys really that bored The Arrancar Encyclopedia! Todays lesson is on the techniques that the Arrancars use! GONZUI Gonzui is used to devour 	a large amount of souls! PESQUISA Pesquisa is used to 	detect Spiritual Pressure! SONIDO Sonido is used to move at fast speeds! CERO  Cero has powerful destructive power!

" Soul Reapers They are the spiritual guardians of the World of the Living They are the balancers who keep a close eye on the countless souls, good and evil, that fill this world Hitsugaya and the others manage to defeat the Arrancars who attacked Karakura Town, but they suffer a lot of damage In order to defeat his inner Hollow, Ichigo goes to the Visoreds He retrains himself with Hirako and the other Visoreds to prepare for the coming showdown Meanwhile, Ukitake has been investigating the actions of Aizen and his followers before they disappeared from Soul Society He discovers Aizens true goal The showdown will be in winter! Until then, we must hone our skills and prepare for battle! Times up It was dangerous not giving me a warning! If the time that you can sustain a Hollow transformation has gotten longer, you should tell me! Whos the one whos not giving any warning! Youre the one who said to endure it as long as possible! Nows not the time to be complaining! Next, next! I told you thats too slow! Hows he doing His time has extended by 05 seconds Wow Thats a big development What Thats all after doing this much! He doesnt have the talent, does he Im surprised that everyone hasnt gotten bored of him We dont have a choice For now, weve got to continue INTERNAL MEDICINE - PEDIATRICS KUROSAKI CLINIC Brother still hasnt come home Forget about him! Hell come back when weve forgotten about him When we forget about him Karin, do you always forget about him Its just a figure of speech Yes Theres no need to worry! When youre at that age, you feel like rebelling against everyone around you and you feel like getting out! What do you mean When I was in high school, I considered the whole world my enemy and left home I wandered to the school at night I went to a far-off ocean and - let out a youthful scream! - Im going to do this! Is Brother doing that too Hes probably somewhere looking at the ocean from which summer has been long gone and fulfilling the desires of his heart during mating season! I keep telling you that you mean adolescence Is that so Well I dont know if thats really the case, but this is Brother were talking about Hell be all right! Now lets eat dinner! Yeah Okay That aside, why isnt Rukia coming home! Youre more worried about her than your own son! Rukia called me to say that shes busy with school work, so shes staying over at Orihimes place Rukia! I thought that I got another daughter Im so sad! Shut up! Stop making a fuss and eat already! Then Abarai will be at Kisuke Uraharas place for a while Yes He made up some excuse about why hes there Do you suppose he likes it there Its the second time hes freeloaded there, so it looks like hes pretty used to the place He said that he was training Chad Surprisingly, he might be enjoying himself Considering the power of the Arrancars, we can never have enough fighting power So what should we do Do you really need to ask Weve got to strengthen ourselves or we wont be able to win this battle Thats right Its annoying, but the Arrancars really are strong Bring it on! I can have fun battles that way! This is definitely something you would like Yeah Matsumoto, if you dont improve your techniques, you wont return to Soul Society alive! I know that! Oh no! Look at the time! If I dont hurry, the shop will be filled with people and I wont get to take my time choosing things! What A shop Im going to check out the town for things to buy I meanfor anything strange Ive got to always be attentive to my surroundings! You just said that you were going shopping! Bye, Captain Ill be back! That jerk She doesnt listen to what people say at all Ive come all this way to the World of the Living, so Ive got to enjoy it! Oh! This is cute! Excuse me!

The Hollows Spiritual Pressure pattern suddenly changed, so we hurried on over Matsumoto, you let your guard down too much! Sorry But this boy Youre an old hag, but youre being scolded by a kid! Old lady is one thing, but I wont let you call me an old hag! Was that an Arrancar just now Yeah But his Spiritual Pressure was murky He wasnt fully mature Whatever his level was, he was an Arrancar We should assume that Aizen sent him intentionally Intentionally, huh Im going to report to Soul Society immediately Im going to perform a Konso on this cocky brat Whats a Konso, old lady I never said that you could call me old lady! Wait, Matsumoto I want to ask him about the Arrancar You can perform the Konso afterwards What! Well If you say so, Captain Oh Youre a captain Thats right I dont believe it!

You came at a good time, beshi! Stop Thank you for waiting You have some naughty lips, lady Here it is! This is it! A new Arrancar was sent to the World of the Living No Captain Hitsugaya wants us to find out if there is any indication of that That means that Aizen has been showing some sort of movement What should we do Analyzing the report comes first Ill do it from here All right I dont understand all this about konsos or Soul Society! What are you old men talking about O-Old men! How can you call me that! It means, to kids you look like an old man, right Dont let it get to you No! I cant forgive him! The sound of the words old man is not a beautiful one! Oh well Hey, boy Youre blinding me, you chrome dome! Chrome dome! Put on a wig! What the hell did you say!

I said that Im not going, so Im not going! I still have things I want to do Come on! Ill defeat you! Hey, what are you doing! Lets ask a different question Did you hear a whistle when that Mock Arrancar appeared Come to think of it, I did! Well I heard one Did he tell you anything Nothing! He just growled at me and attacked! I see Even if we ask him anything more we wont find out anything new, will we It seems like they just happened to meet there by chance So it seems Oh well Lets perform a Konso Huh! No! I still have things I have to do here! I dont want to go anywhere! These are the rules Dont be stubborn! No! Stop it, stupid! Let me go! Captain! Hold on a moment! I think this boy is confused by what just happened We can wait through the night before sending him! Old lady Its not old lady, its lady! All right Matsumoto, Ill leave this case to you Thank you very much! My, my What a weirdo Anyway, as long as we dont know what Aizens goal is, we cant be too careful Dont let your guard down! - Yes - Yes Were going to go If I have this, even I could Even you could what Hey! Dont take other peoples things without permission Tsk! Old lady, you sure are stingy My name is Rangiku Matsumoto! Its not old lady! Call me Ms Rangiku! Okay What were you planning to do after taking my sword It doesnt concern you! It does concern me! Its our job as Soul Reapers to protect souls like you! This is as important to us as our lives! You wouldnt like it if I took something important from you without permission, would you No Now apologize Huh If you do something bad, you apologize by saying Im sorry Its only proper! If you dont A-All right Im sorry Wheres the Ms Rangiku Ms Rangiku Good Come to think of it, whats your name Then wheres your family Why were you there Why wont you say anything! Then What is this thing that you have to do here Theres someone Im looking for Who We have to meet! So who is it The town is dangerous right now! Huh That monster earlier You dont know when those will appear again! Theres no way you can handle them! At least tell me your name Shota Its Shota Toyokawa I see! Shota, huh! Its that sound! That murky Spiritual Pressure! Its the same as that Mock Arrancar this evening! Dont you think that Matsumotos soul candy is behaving oddly Its behaving oddly and talking strangely Really Isnt it always like this Who gave you your soul candies Our lieutenant H-How suspicious The Arrancar Encyclopedia! Today, were going to talk about the Arrancars Zanpakuto release VOLCANICA   An Arrancars Zanpakuto is 	the center of its power DEL TORO   and is sealed away in the form 	of a sword DEL TORO   when they release their sword, 	theyre releasing its true form TIJERETA   By the way, Grimmjows true form is Someone always interferes whenever I try to release my Zanpakuto Who should I get to interfere with him next"
" Upon the discovery of Aizens true goal, the fierce battle between Soul Society and Hueco Mundo has been taken to a whole new level The showdown will be in winter! Until then, we must hone our skills and prepare for battle! Ichigo, Sado, and Ishida undergo harsh training in preparation for the impending showdown with Aizen Hitsugayas advance troops also remain in Karakura Town and continue to guard the town One day, a new Arrancar appears Rangiku protects the soul of a boy named Shota who happens to be at the scene But the incident doesnt end there Its that sound! That murky Spiritual Pressure! Its the same as that Mock Arrancar this evening! Shota, Im going to find out where that whistling is coming from You go home by yourself! Im going too! What, that again But if that Arrancar from this evening has allies nearby All right! But in return, I want you to stick close to me! Huh! All right, Ms Rangiku! Okay! Lets go! All right! S-Stop! Help Help me! Stop! Go away! Stop right there! Whats the meaning of this It isnt just its Spiritual Pressure thats the same It even looks the same! Oh no! Why you Ms Rangiku! Stand back! Im feeling stronger! Whats the meaning of this! It looks exactly like the one Ikkaku killed Are there two look-alikes! Who knows Take this! Take this! Why you Shota, no! Shota! Captain! Matsumoto! Yes, sir! Growl, Haineko! Its over for you Matsumoto! were capturing it alive! Yes, Captain! Whats so funny! Do you think youve caught me A third one! And a fourth one! There are more! What! I thought so Theyre Arrancars that look the same! Growl, Haineko! Shota! It doesnt matter how many of us you defeat! Whats this! This is Ayasegawa We are currently battling Mock Arrancars We detected the Spiritual Pressure of  the Mock Arrancar that we encountered earlier! I followed the signal and encountered it! But whats the meaning of this Isnt this the guy that Ikkaku killed today Yes In other words Captain! Madarame! Ayasegawa! were in combat as well They can multiply! Exterminate them all! So he says Its a lot simpler that way! Tsk! Things will never end at this rate! Hold on tight, Shota! Okay! Lets lead them into a wide area and crush them all at once! What wide area What about that park we saw earlier Thats it! Matsumoto, go ahead of me! Okay! You have nowhere to escape to anymore! Youre finished! Captain! Youre the ones who are finished! Frost unto the Heavens, Hyorinmaru! That was wonderful, Captain! Awesome Yumichika! Ikkaku! Are you both all right Dont underestimate us! Those guys werent a problem at all! Though they were troublesome because of their numbers I wanted to capture at least one of them alive Huh Thats Shota, whats wrong Yui! Yui! Yui! Shota, whats wrong Its Yui! Shes my sister! Huh! Yui! Yui! It doesnt seem like anythings wrong with her Shes a normal soul I see Are you all right, Yui were safe here That thing you said that you had to do You were trying to find your sister, werent you Shota What happened We were all in a car My dad, my mom, Yui and I We were going to the amusement park See Isnt that a nice sound, big brother! Its just a lot of noise! Thats not true! When I came to, I had this chain And my dad and my mom were gone Is that why you were searching for your sister Y-Yeah Yui! Yui Can you tell who I am Big brother Thank goodness! Thank goodness! But why did she suddenly appear in the park Do you have any ideas Well Shota Youre still Ukitake! Hey, Captain Hitsugaya It looks like youre having quite a bit of trouble Whats wrong Its about the Arrancar you encountered Im going to let someone from the Department of Research and Development tell you their findings Im Akon of the Department of Research and Development Were told the Arrancar that you defeated appeared once again Yes Furthermore, he multiplied before our eyes We killed all of them that were there, but Im not sure if thats the end of it Its probably not over yet What do you mean When I checked a record of the Spiritual Pressure in the area, it matched that of all the multiplied Mock Arrancar In other words, when they split, they arent separate entities Together, they form a single colony Does that mean that they share a single consciousness Yes We believe that this Arrancar moves several clones at once in order to absorb as many souls as possible Theyre like worker ants Yes Their main body is probably hiding somewhere and giving orders to the clones How troublesome Is there any way to find out where their nest is It is difficult to pinpoint According to the report, whenever they appear, theres always a whistling sound Yes Whenever it appeared, we always heard that sound S-Stop! That sound restrains their victims, and controls their movements I shall analyze that sound so that we can pinpoint when they will appear Take care of it Things sure have become troublesome Ive bought some bento boxes! Seriously though Im always impressed by these convenience stores Along with rice balls, they even sell these in the middle of the night Welcome back! Captain! They brought some bento boxes! Lets put together our plan after weve had something to eat! Im stuffed! Now then, about the Mock Arrancar Ive already gone over everything we know about them Whatever the case, we must spread out over a large area and prepare to quickly deal with various situations Well, that about sums it up It looks like this will keep me from getting bored! Well take turns watching the town Matsumoto, you stay here and watch these two All right Shouldnt we perform a Konso Big brother No We can do that later Really I see Youre very kind, arent you Huh These siblings have finally come together Hes going to let them stay together for a while Captain Shut up Lets go! Big brother What a great bath I really love a bath before work Oh, hows Yui Shes still sleeping Whats wrong You finally got to see Yui Are you still hiding something You were behaving strangely when my captain asked you about what happened in the park this morning Dont keep it to yourself Tell me about it! Its nothing! Its nothing It doesnt concern you! Whats going on! My bodys moving on its own Whos there Hes appeared! This way, eh! How repulsive Wait! Crap! Captain! Ikkaku! Lets split up and go after them! - Okay! - Okay! Yui! Hey! Why do you think shes here Well Just now I sensed that Arrancars-- Shota! Wait! Where did it go! Hey! Its all right Im not an enemy Did you see a monster Dont worry Its all right now Its no good Crap! Shota! Wait up! Its dangerous here! Weve got to go back! No! Shota! Well look for Yui Thats no good! I have to protect Yui myself! Shota, you Yui When did she Yui! What were you doing here! I wasnt doing anything I just wanted to come to this park Big brother Now that youre here, Im all right now Im not afraid of anything Damn it! Iran away Huh Yui I left her here And ran away! An Arrancar that multiplies In other words, if you leave one, theyll keep multiplying! What a coincidence I was just thinking the same thing We could fight as much as we wanted with one of them! Weve got to capture one! Theyre pretty energetic They probably got a stupid idea into their heads - Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! - Lets eat! Come to think of it, we always use this room as if its ours Is that all right Orihime went to Soul Society with Kuchiki, so its completely all right Oh yeah Well, I thought so Though, I am sad that I cant eat Orihimes delicious cooking Oh Shes really good at cooking Wed like to try some too You probably shouldnt Why"
" Hitsugayas advance troops have remained in Karakura Town, and a new Arrancar has appeared before them This Arrancar is a troublesome enemy because he clones himself Hitsugaya and the others manage to drive off the first group of Arrancars that appear and protect, Shota and Yui, a pair of souls who are siblings But that is not the end of it According to an analysis done in Soul Society, this Arrancar controls several clones at once in order to absorb as many souls as possible Lets split up and go after him! - Okay! - Okay! Wait! Hey! Its all right Im not an enemy Did you see a monster Shota! Wait up! Its dangerous here! Weve got to go back! No! Shota! Well look for Yui Thats no good! I have to protect Yui myself! Shota, you Yui When did she Yui! What were you doing here! I wasnt doing anything I just wanted to come to this park Now that youre here, Im all right now Im not afraid of anything Iran away Yui I left her here And ran away! On the day of the accident We got separated from mom and dad Yui and I were so afraid Day after day, we looked everywhere for them But we couldnt find them no matter where we looked Yui! Yui! Yui went to go look for them by herself Yui! Yui! Yui! Big brother! Help! Help! Big brother! Big brother! Wait! Wait! Big brother, help! Big brother! When I came to I was trembling somewhere far away from the park Yui was Because I ran away, it Im despicable So what happened afterwards Ireally regretted what I did I gathered up the courage And I went to the park but Yui wasnt there Then it showed up again Wheres Yui! Who knows Give Yui back! Look for her yourself Why you You punk! Thats when you came Hey! Let me go! IIabandoned Yui Despite that, Yui still says that Ill protect her Ms Rangiku It was tough, wasnt it, Shota Dont cry Im not certain what to make of what happened, but at least Yui was saved And she got to see you again Its not too late now Protect Yui Okay! But if Shotas story is true The reason why Yui encountered the Mock Arrancar was probably because Yes Matsumoto Its me I went after the Mock Arrancars, but they got away Where are you right now Im taking care of a soul who was attacked I asked him whether he knew anything, but hes so terrified he cant speak Anyway, Im heading back Understood Well head back too All right Well meet up at Captain! You bastard! Im taking care of a soul who was attacked Could it be that it transformed into a human soul So thats how it stayed hidden and attacked souls Oh no I cant follow his Spiritual Pressure either Captain Hitsugaya! Ayasegawa I had a call from Rangiku Are you all right Things have become troublesome Huh Ill tell you the details after we go back Captain! Are you all right! Yeah I just let my guard down and dropped my Soul Pager Thank goodness Wheres Madarame Hes keeping watch over the town CaptainTheres something that Ive been wondering about Something youve been wondering about Yes It might have something to do with the appearance of the enemy All right Ill listen to what you have to say The first! Yes Taking the date and the time into consideration There is a very high possibility that the first person that the Mock Arrancar encountered was Yui But how did she survive I still dont know yet It doesnt seem like she even remembers Yui Im sorry Captain Hitsugaya, what do you think Captain So thats it Theres one thing Ive figured out Does it have anything to do with what were talking about Yes It seems that these Mock Arrancars can transform into human souls Huh! By transforming into human souls, they can hide their Spiritual Pressure and escape the watch of Soul Society They probably approached human souls in their transformed state to catch them off their guard and absorb their spiritual power They use that power to multiply even further Furthermore, by cloning themselves, it is possible for these Mock Arrancars to absorb many souls at once They can gather an incredible amount of power in a short amount of time They can transform into humans It cant be! I I What of it! This has nothing to do with Yui! Big brother Sorry, Shota Were still not sure if that is the case, but Thats right Captain! Stop! No! Why you Yui! He cant perform a Konso! Yui! Big brotherII dont know anything - Captain - Its all right - The Arrancar has definitely - Dont worry done something to her Well, then Unfortunately, we dont know when shell show her true form Shes definitely dangerous All right! Have Soul Society examine this childs Spiritual Pressure immediately We now have all the reishi samples we need Sorry, but please hurry! Okay I never expected the Mock Arrancars to become the people they attack Theyre increasing their power in that manner, and waiting for the right time to come Well find and crush the main body before that happens! Youre right Ill contact you as soon as I get results from the analysis Until we get those results Im going to have her stay within a kido barrier Why! Youre locking her up! You cant! I feel sorry for Yui! Shota, this is for Yuis sake That Arrancar has done something to her No, they might even be after her This is a way we can protect her Dont you think so If shes in the barrier, the enemy cannot get to her Its all right Well defeat the Arrancar in the meantime Okay Believe in us! Yui, bear with this for a little while, okay But Imkind of scared Yui Oh yeah Here! This is a little different from the one you had Sorry This is all I can do Could you wait inside the barrier Okay! Well If Yuis fine with it Thank you Now that its settled, Im going to trade off with Ikkaku No Ill trade off with Madarame Ayasegawa, you go to Uraharas Shop Uraharas Shop Tell Abarai the situation Yes Matsumoto, take care of those two Understood We dont know what the enemy is going to do Dont let your guard down Its almost time My power is almost at its peak Did you sleep well, Yui Yeah Big brother, I want to go outside Sorry I want to let you out, but I cant I want to see mom and dad I want to see them, too, but Its all right, big brother I can get out of here with your help Huh Big brother, stand up O-Okay Big brother, give me your hand Like this Whats this Lets go, big brother Well, did you discover anything Pretty much Take a look at this OhThis is Its as we suspected Yui, Shota Where did they go Could it be! Matsumoto, whats wrong Captain! The barrier! What! There are still some traces of Spiritual Pressure How was the barrier broken Do you suppose that the kids did it I dont know Anyway, lets look for them Yeah Captain Ukitake About your request We have the results Huh Matsumoto, you go look for them Ill catch up with you after I hear what he has to say Understood So what are the results Weve concluded that Yui Toyokawa is a clone created by the Mock Arrancar A clone She probably had strong potential spiritual power as a human It all began when she encountered the Mock Arrancar We believe that the Mock Arrancar absorbed Yui Toyokawas spiritual power by chance The Arrancar then had an explosive gain in power and developed the ability to multiply its clones and gather power for its main body He then used that method to increase his power in a short amount of time by absorbing a large amount of souls I see But it seemed like that girl was moving of her own accord No, the enemy is controlling her - Theres a high possibility that its all an act - Say, Yui What is it - If thats the case - Where are we going If we destroy the main body Shell disappear too - Thats what it means - Just follow me O-Okay If Yui Toyokawa has strong spiritual power, then what about her older brother, Shota There is a possibility for relatives to have the same level of spiritual power I see! She used Shotas power to break my Kyomon! The enemy is after Shotas spiritual power! Shota Where did you go There they are! Shota! Yui! Ms Rangiku! How did you break that barrier! It was easy to get out of that! Dont go! Come back! Dont interfere Yui Yui! Yui! What is this Spiritual Pressure Theyve come! My, my It looks like theyre all prepared Big brothercome here But Shota! Dont go! Big brother Why is my body moving on its own! Shota! Shota! Yui Big brother Crap Yui! Yui! Yui! B-Big brother Dont Yui! Whats wrong! Dont! Dont, big brother Dont come near me! Akon, theres a letter from Third Seat Madarame asking when the item he ordered is going to be completed His order He wanted molars Oh! I forgot! All right! Well send him this empty box and tell him that theyre molars that are invisible to idiots Is that all right It should be The Arrancar Encyclopedia Hello Today Im going to tell you the Arrancars numbers UNDECIMO               TRECE   QUINCE              DIECISEIS   	The Arrancars are numbered 	according to their birth order, according to their birth order, starting from eleven DIEZ                                    The ones with particularly SEIS                                     deadly killing abilities 	are numbered from one through ten by order of strength ESPADA   Those ten are called the Espada Just between you and me, Ulquiorras number is Its still not the time to reveal that Youre no fun"
" Ichigo, Sado, and Ishida undergo harsh training in preparation for the impending showdown with Aizen Rukia and Orihime also head to Soul Society in order to get stronger Hitsugayas advance troops have remained in Karakura Town One day, a Mock Arrancar that can continuously multiply appears before them If they dont destroy its main body, the Mock Arrancar ill continue to multiply It all began when she encountered the Mock Arrancar Weve concluded that Yui Toyokawa is a clone created by the Mock Arrancar And now Yui is helping the Mock Arrancar absorb Shota as well Yui! Whats wrong! Dont Get away immediately Yui! Dont! What! Growl, Haineko! Yui! Yui! Are you all right! What! Thats Big brother! Dont! Big brotherrun away You bastard! I cant I wont run away and leave you behind ever again! So thats the main body Big brother Im glad he didnt eat you What are you saying Im going to protect you Its no good I Whats wrong! Yui! Crap What is this Why cant I move! Yui Yui This girl I never expected her to still have the will to defy me But it ends here! Yui! Yui Hado 4: Byakurai! Get a hold of yourself, Shota! Ms Rangiku Yui got I know Soul Reapers I cant forgive you anymore Forgive me I ate this girl And I got this power! Hold steady Get behind me! Soul Reapers are nothing in the face of the power Ive stored up Dont you know who I am Im Squad 10 Lieutenant Rangiku Matsumoto! Dont underestimate me! A lieutenant Thats good Now Im looking forward to eating you! Too slow! Now to finish you off! Growl, Haineko! Dont underestimate me! Whered he go! Shota! Im coming Now, which one of you should I eat first Im not finished yet! Matsumoto! Step aside! Frost unto the Heavens, Hyorinmaru! Whats this! Captain! Get Shota! Shota! Ms Rangiku! Its getting out! Who are you! Squad 10 Captain, Toshiro Hitsugaya! A captain! Since you didnt know that we were in the World of the Living, it doesnt seem like youre taking orders from Aizen! I guess that means that you mutated after absorbing a humans Spiritual Pressure! You bastard This is it Prepare yourself! A-Are you all right with that! If you kill me, that girl will disappear with me! I thought so Those are the results we got from Soul Society But such threats wont work against us Dont! Shota! Yuis still alive! She told me to run away! So I cant weigh one soul on the same scale as the entire town Dont! Hey! - Shota, stop! - Dont! Out of the way! Yui! Wait! You missed your best chance to defeat me What! As long as Im in this sub-space, you wont be able to find me But I can hide my Spiritual Pressure, attack souls and make as many clones as I want Behold! My army of servants! Captain Hitsugaya! Madarame! Ayasegawa! Whats with these numbers! No wonder there was no end to them no matter how many we destroyed I can multiply about 16 times in a day! It took you too long to realize that With this many of me, itll be impossible to stop me from multiplying Ive eaten most of the souls in this town Ill have to eat the humans next Later! Wait up! Wait, Madarame! Well never end this if we cut down every one of them Thats true, but we cant leave them alone Squad 11 is a battle squad Rather than thinking about bothersome things, well crush them until we run out of spiritual power Please let us go! You can think of a way to deal with them in the meantime All right! - Lets go! - Okay! This is Hitsugaya This is the Department of Research and Development We encountered the Mock Arrancars main body, but it got away Can you track it Were doing that right now Its no good! We really cant track it Im unable to provide support We lost sight of it There are no traces of any distortions, either Damn Im very sorry Whats this! What is it, Rin! Weve pinpointed the location of the sound that the Arrancar uses to control souls! What do you mean The main body produces the sound, while the clones only act as speakers Im asking you how its done In other words, its as if the main body and the clones are connected by a wireless connection They probably deliver the spiritual power they absorb to the main body in the same way! If thats true, we may be able to pinpoint the location of the main body by looking at the distribution of the clones Um Am I wrong All systems, analyze the distribution of Spiritual Pressure! All right This is good! Send them the coordinate data, Rin! Yes, sir! Shota The Arrancars were fighting were originally called Hollows Theyre fallen souls A soul that still has an attachment to the world and becomes corrupted, loses its heart and becomes a Hollow We Soul Reapers exist not only to save souls, but to save Hollows as well By cutting Hollows with our Zanpakuto, we wash Hollows of their sins and lead them to Soul Society Its all necessary in order for them to be born anew We couldnt protect Yui But we can still save Yuis soul Ms Rangiku This time, its your turn! Hold on Lets save Yuis soul together Are you finished talking Lets go! - Yes, sir! - Yes, sir! You cant defeat me with attacks like that URAHARAS SHOP   What are you doing! Are you those multiplying Arrancar clones! Here I go! Whats with their numbers! Looks like my routine chores Will have to wait for the time being, nya! Dont slack off! I knew it The clones arent spread out over such a wide area When I calculate the location of their source by analyzing the distribution of the appearance of the clones Karakura Town, East Near the river So how do we find him According to the Department of Research and Development, hes only hiding his Spiritual Pressure The main body needs to be able to communicate with its clones Theres no way that hed be hiding in a place thats shut off from the World of the Living, like Hueco Mundo Hes probably hiding within a special barrier I see In that case, if we hit his barrier with our Spiritual Pressure we should be able to break it Understood Ill get to that No Ill do it In order to pry him open from his protective space we need a proportional amount of Spiritual Pressure You take care of the enemy when it comes jumping out! Yes sir! Here I go! Bankai! Daiguren Hyorinmaru! Whats this! Whats going on! Its that Soul Reaper from earlier! Hes come this far But he wont be able to hit me if he releases his Spiritual Pressure recklessly! Now come out! Is this Captain Hitsugayas Spiritual Pressure What is he doing Jeez! I just keep cutting and cutting! Will Captain Hitsugaya be all right Maybe he should have applied for a Gentei Kaijo Damn! Captain Yui! Where are you! Answer me! Yui! Once more! Fool! Youre going to do that again! Even if youre a captain, trying to destroy my space with Spiritual Pressure is only Whats this! That sound! Its Yui! Why is it whistling! I should have absorbed that girl completely So why! Yui Do you know where its coming from! There! Captain! I found you How dare you I wont forgive youI wont! Crush into bits! Dentis! Here I go! Is that the best you can do, kid! Crap! I released too much of my Spiritual Pressure! Oh well! Ill finish this all at once! Ryusenka! My Hierro, Iron Skin, is like that of the Espada! So it didnt reach you Take a look! Wh-What! Stop! M-My legs! Matsumoto! Finish him off! Yes, sir! Shota, hold onto the sword! Okay! You save Yui! Okay! You wont defeat me It stopped moving! Now! Yui! Big brother Yui The souls that it devoured Whats this! Look at that! Whats going on! They suddenly disappeared, nya Shota! Ms Rangiku Yui got to go to Soul Society Isnt that right! She can be reborn, right! Yes I give you my word Then Ive got to go after her right away Lets go Yeah It hurtsMs Rangiku Everyones going to be training here until winter, right But you just want to have fun in the World of the Living, dont you Thats not true As proof, well show you our daily lives in the next episode Youre just doing whatever you like Its all right Weve got permission from him Whos him Could it be Ku-! - Illustrated guide to Soul Reapers! - Golden! Were having Korean barbecue for dinner tonight! - Alright! - Meat! Meat! Wait, wait, wait!

" Aizen has stolen the Hogyoku, a material that can remove the barrier between Soul Reaper and Hollow He has gone to Hueco Mundo, and is raising a powerful army of Arrancars Ichigo and his friends manage to fight off the first wave of Arrancars, but they end up taking a lot of damage Aizens true goal is to kill the Soul King, Soul Societys king Because of that, Karakura Town and the area around it is in danger of disappearing The Arrancars plan to come to the World of the Living in the winter Ichigo, Sado, Ishida, Rukia and Orihime all undergo harsh training during the time that remains until their showdown Furthermore, Hitsugayas advance troops, who have remained in the World of the Living, continue to clash with powerful Hollows who begin to appear in the World of the Living Its as I expected Its here What are you doing URAHARAS SHOP   Well, everyone Take care while were away Be sure to eat three meals a day Dont forget to brush your teeth after each meal Okay Why are you taking Sado with you Youre just stocking up, right Its to help him unwind Sado will burn out if he continues to focus solely on training He needs to get some fresh air once in a while Right, Sado I want to keep training, but I appreciate your consideration Hurry and bring him back, Mr Urahara There are still a lot of things we have to do Abarai, youre as short-tempered as usual, arent you Its all right Were off then Later Ill be off Okay Leave the shop to us! Have a nice trip Uraharas really good at this, isnt he Good at what, Lirin He says that he wants Chad to unwind, but he plans on making him carry things Is that so Definitely I see Well, if Sado is with them, theyll be able to bring back a lot more at once than theyre usually able to Chad Anyway, how much do they plan on buying They dont even sell that much stuff in this store Jinta Did you say something, Jinta I thought so Be careful of what you say This is not a place you should be entering without Lord Aizens permission, Patras I dont like that You always say the same thing Whats that Lord Aizen Lord Aizen The same goes for the other Espada I just dont understand Its unpleasant Hes a Soul Reaper Why do we Hollows have to take orders from a Soul Reaper We eat souls and crush Soul Reapers Why do we have to abandon that way of life Why must we have our freedom taken away! All for someone like him! You should know Aizen continuously used us Hollows in his experiments I know So what of it Ever since he appeared, this place has changed I have no intention of following a Soul Reaper And Ulquiorra Why dont we use the Hogyoku and control the world Dont bother You cant even become an Espada What can you do I cant get your support, huh I guess I have no choice then I already have two supporters Patras You bastard How unfortunate The Espada sure have fallen I didnt really hate you, though That was easy Yeah That was pathetic Were going to make Aizen regret that he strengthened us with the Hogyoku And Im going to become king! URAHARAS SHOP Umm Move out of the way Oh Sorry I just dont know what to do when I suddenly have free time Umm, move out of the way O-Okay You idiot Youve got to train for your final battle, right Then go do that I know that without you telling me Umm Move out of the way O-Okay Youre really useless when youre not fighting What did you say! Want to fight Ah The weather sure is nice, isnt it Yeah It sure is boring without Ichigo Its fun to tease him You were teasing him with your stream of curses Of course He always reacts to them seriously, so its fun Oh I always thought that you were having a lovers quarrel No, no Honestly He should show up once in a while Youre really worried about him, arent you I agree with Kurodos idea Its not like that! What! What is this What incredible Spiritual Pressure! We have a confirmed Arrancar reading in Karakura Town I repeat We have a confirmed Arrancar reading in Karakura Town We have confirmed that the Arrancar reading is at coordinates 3800 We know I request a Gentei Kaijo Dont worry! We have already simplified the procedures to receive permission You should get permission immediately Understood It sure has gotten convenient! Matsumoto! Abarai! Madarame! Ayasegawa! Can you hear me! Yes! I also have confirmation It looks like things will be fun again It seems a little troublesome, though This is Abarai! Im the furthest away Go on ahead of me The Soul Reapers have quickly sniffed us out and are coming this way What a letdown They all seem weak What should we do, Patras I want you to handle the Soul Reapers They dont seem very powerful But I dont want them to interfere with our investigation Is it true that theres someone in this town that knows how to use the Hogyoku Thats why weve come here Weve only obtained it But if we dont know how to use it, then its just a ball Sooner or later someone from Las Noches will come for us Thats the real battle Act swiftly Lets meet up afterwards Captain! Look out Theyre close! Captain Hitsugaya! Yeah Theyre coming! How cocky Oh well Stab! Erisuto! The difference in our power is self-evident Theres no need to take you seriously Unfortunately, we dont have time We need you to die here Freeze! Abare! Yeah! Jeez Ever since Sister Rukia and Inoue went to Soul Society, Ive been so bored Is there a paradise-level goddess anywhere Perhaps over there! Somethings there Who are you K-Kon So thats your Zanpakuto release Thats right! This is my true form! Im going to finish this all at once! Frost unto the Heavens! Hyorinmaru! Why you! Its useless! Oh This is my Zanpakuto release! Yumichika! This fight is mine! Dont interfere! Again, Ikkaku Let me fight sometimes Sorry Extend! Hozukimaru! Youre taking me on by yourself How foolish! You Arrancar As usual, youve got tough skin! Thats Hey, get a hold of yourself! Oh, Renji! What happened Some guy with incredible Spiritual Pressure suddenly Its an Arrancar! Where did he go Th-That way Could it be! URAHARAS SHOP Stop! This is no place for your kind to come! Terrible things will happen to you if you dont stop! Hey, you! What should we do Hes dangerous And its impossible to take him on in this form Indeed Retreat! Hey, wait! I hear that someone here knows how to use the Hogyoku Id like to meet him Hes not here So there are others Who are you Thirteen Court Guard Squads, Squad 6 Lieutenant, Renji Abarai! Where is the person who knows how to use the Hogyoku Im saying that hes gone out! Then Ill just have to wait here for his return I cant let you do that Im keeping watch over the shop while hes gone! Just waiting here is boring Very well Come on! Roar! Zabimaru! What are you doing, freeloader! Why you Ururu! Get inside! It wont matter if you hide What are you going to do If we fight here, that shack will immediately be crushed You think so That stores owner is pretty shrewd It shouldnt be that easy! Besides, that just means I have to finish this before that happens! Want to try What should we do, Jinta What should we do Weve got to fight! Ururu, you stay here! But Ahem! Hey! Were going out first! Weve got to assist Renji! As freeloaders, we shouldnt hide like this! You all Roar! Zabimaru! Too slow! Oh It seems that youre a little capable Not just a little! Very well I wasnt going to show my sword to the likes of you, but I will! Youre exaggerating! Come on! How weak I have 20 levels to my sword skill That was the lowest Level one It was a gesture of respect But youre nothing if you cant even keep up with this level You idiot! I just let my guard down a little! Nonsense! Then take this once more! How weak Things wont be that easy! Who are you! Were also keeping watch over this place! Youll pay if you dont leave right away! Stop! Dont-- We will do it! Its the job of a freeloader to defend the household at times like this Its all right We wont do anything rash Dont say I didnt warn you! Here we go! Whats this Where are you looking! What! Weve forced him into the barrier! Now, Kurodo! All right! Team attack, Abarai! Thats creepy! Dont say that! Roar! Zabimaru! Dont underestimate me! Ive got you! You look like him, but the difference in your Spiritual Pressure is obvious! Kurodo! Tricking me with such silly illusions Die! How impertinent! How long will you last! The finishing blow! I wont let you! It doesnt seem like you understand what I mean even when I tell you So taste level two! This is still just the beginning Weve had quite a lot of appearances today Could it be that when the spotlight turns to us, were going to di- Kurodo! Dont say any more What an ominous thing to say Were forever immortal Thats also doubtful Illustrated guide to Soul Reapers! Hurry up Todays your turn to go shopping Why with you - Huh - Huh A Hollow All right, lets go! Wait, Ichigo What is it! A lot of your friends can see Soul Reapers, right In order to keep them from recognizing you Wear this Oh Thank you Why! Hes gotten quite good at playing the straight man"
" Patras, one of the Arrancars, does not like the fact that Aizen rules the Hollows He steals the Hogyoku and escapes Hueco Mundo with his two comrades They attack Uraharas Shop in order to find out how to use the Hogyoku from Urahara A fierce battle breaks out with Abarai, who is left in charge of the shop It doesnt seem like you understand what I mean even when I tell you So taste level two! This is still just the beginning Shatter, Kyokasuigetsu! What an elaborate thing for you to do, Captain Aizen Gin, huh Even if they collaborated and were up to no good Making them believe that they had killed Ulquiorra and letting them take the Hogyoku Theres no need to do this in such a roundabout way You should just kill them immediately What are you thinking I have something else I need Ulquiorra to do If you give me the word, Ill do it But that would be boring Oh URAHARAS SHOP What are you doing, Ururu! Jinta Home-Run! Jinta! When will the person who knows about the Hogyoku come back Im beginning to get bored Hell come back when youre dead You show-off! Renji! Freeloader, are you all right! Somewhat Very well But I think that its useless no matter how much you struggle You two go and get Mr Urahara! But Just go! But All right Lets go, Jinta! Crap! Dont die, freeloader! Thank you for taking the time to make them bring him But will you survive until then Now its level three! Shut up! You just keep on raising your level little by little What a cheater If you continue to put up a confident front, youll be in tears later! Gentei Kaijo! Bankai! Hihio Zabimaru! Oh A bankai Its been a while Roar! Zabimaru! This is nothing! Wake up Something like this wont kill you, right What a very interesting house Im glad you like it! We dont have to hold back here Here I go! Captain Are you already panting! Crap! Honestly Five Arrancars were defeated by these guys Jeez How pathetic! Matsumoto! Come on, come on, come on! Whats wrong! Whats wrong! Frost unto the Heavens! Hyorinmaru! Youre not even an Espada I cant waste any more time on you! Dont get cocky with that attack! No matter how many times you try, you cant defeat me! You only attack by hurling yourself at your enemy You boast too much How truly revolting Im going to blow you away next! Dont look the other way! Im your opponent! Its useless For the record, I got one! Level ten What! Im still not serious either! If this is your level ten, then youre not really that strong, are you! Insignificant Soul Reaper Youre getting carried away! Dont think that someone like you could ever be our opponent! Weve wiped out Soul Reapers for ages And yet Someone like that And yet, what Nothing Its of no concern to you I see But you said something I cannot ignore! What would that be You called me an insignificant Soul Reaper! Dont underestimate us Soul Reapers! Very well Then out of respect for your fearlessness even in the face of death, I shall show you my proper form Defile! Gerifalte! This is my maximum level! I fell asleep! Lirin, rather than fell asleep, I think the correct term is lost consciousness Shut up! Wheres Renji Has he already been defeated What negative thinking Thats no good, you know I sense Spiritual Pressure coming from the basement - Lets go - What! Were going! Of course! Sorry I cant control my power in this form What I guess this ends my way of passing the time Im going to hit you the next time Dont underestimate me! Here I go, Soul Reaper! Please hurry! Hows Abarai Hell be all right He wont be defeated that easily Im more worried about the store than the freeloader Oh You blocked it with a segment of your blade Its not over yet! I see So it seems Whoa A-Abarai Itll be dangerous if he continues I want to ask you one thing What is it What do you plan to do with the Hogyoku Gain control of all worlds Does that mean youre rebelling against Aizen We dont accept him! I guess this means the other side is not so unified A Soul Reaper should never become the ruler of Hueco Mundo! Whats with that pathetic state Sh-Shut up Anyway Pursuers could come at any moment Do you know how to use the Hogyoku Pursuers You dont know yet! Calm down Youre wasting time on this guy I-Impossible! Crap! This is terrible Patras, I kind of regret taking up your proposal You knew from the beginning that sacrifices were necessary, huh Yes It cant be helped Besides, anyone whod be beaten by a Soul Reaper wont be of any help in furthering my goals You bastard This is for the Hogyoku to defeat Aizen Therefore, I cant lose to you here! I dont have any reason to lose to you either! Lets finish this Okay Sounds good Roar! Zabimaru! I thought so Crap Allow me to commend you You made me change my opinion of Soul Reapers, though just a little But things must come to an end Dont decide that on your own I think that giving up is important sometimes Do you have any last words It doesnt seem like you have any Well then Roar! Zabimaru! - Zabimaru! - Zabimaru! - Zabimaru! - Zabimaru! Another illusion This isnt only an illusion Why you! Youre making fun of me! Renji, get a hold of yourself! You followed me again You guys cant handle him We cant leave you alone! Stop There, there, there, there, there, there! Youre in the way! You idiots I told you to stop Were all right Anyway, we found his weakness! What Kurodo! Noba! You understand, right! Yes! No problem M-My hip Renji, well stop him from attacking You hit him with a big one! Wait! If you continue, youll really You idiot! Were mod souls that were created to fight We cant quit just because we cant win And besides, you cant let it end in a place like this, right Oh well Dont die! Whats wrong! How long are you going to stay hidden Were not really hiding! Weve seen through your attack! I was wondering who it could be, but it was just some small fry You just use silly illusions Hey! Whore you calling a small fry! At least I dont just use one stupid attack, like you do! What Im telling you Weve seen through your attack! Use a different attack if you want to win! I guess I have no choice if youre going to go that far Ill wipe you out without a trace He fell for it! Here I go then! How silly Take this! Burst! Gerifalte! How foolish Wh-What! Impossible! What do you think Youre the one who was really the fool! You specialize in sword-drawing techniques Whenever you drew your sword, you always immediately put it back into its sheath In other words, you were storing energy in your sheath and using your sword as a trigger to release that energy And as long as you cant put your sword away, you cant make the next attack Also, the stronger your attacks were, the larger your movements became Even if you specialize in sword-drawing techniques, its possible for Noba to toss things in your way! Why you Now! Renji! Okay Hikotsu Taiho! Take this! This cant be! In a place like this! Lirin! You did it, Renji Mr Urahara Sorry Im late Mr Urahara I just got back, Abarai Kurodo! Noba! You worked very hard We just got a little beaten up, though Noba Lots of problems Abarai! Are you all right Captain Hitsugaya Yes, somewhat Oh my It seems like you had problems too What happened to them It seems theyre dead Aizen was toying with them Toying with them Is that the Hogyoku they brought Thats Aizen probably let them steal a fake The Hogyoku wont crack that easily I made it, so theres no mistake Aizen probably tricked them Most likely with his Kyokasuigetsu Theres no way that they would be able to steal the Hogyoku from Aizen so easily He let them take it But why Who knows I dont know that much Did you come after them I have no intention of fighting you They may have had a different goal, and used those Arrancars to create a front Theres no way that no one came after them after all this time has passed Even if they left them alone, wed deal with them Even if hes going to purge them, its fun for him to plan farces like this Hes that sort of man So Traces of that event still exist At the time, most of it was guesswork, but upon investigating it again, Ive gotten an idea of what her abilities are What do you think I think it will be of use to you I see So where is she right now Shes probably not in the World of the Living Good work No problem Hiyori, how long can Ichigo maintain a Hollow transformation Its finally reached the double digits! Ah! He finally surpassed ten minutes! No, baldy! Hes still at ten seconds! Is that all Dont be so difficult! No! Im at eleven seconds! - It doesnt matter which it is! - It does!

" Ulquiorra, coming in So youve come Ulquiorra Yammy I was just finishing up How much of the Hogyoku has awakened Its gone about halfway Things are going as planned For Soul Society, that is Its only natural You wouldnt be able to tell unless you held the Hogyoku in your hands Kisuke Urahara sealed it away as soon as he developed it, and he never unsealed it Even he probably doesnt know After being unsealed and in a sleeping state, when the Hogyoku temporarily fuses with someone with the Spiritual Pressure of a captain For an instant, it displays the same power as if it were completely awake Could you tell me your name, my new comrade Wonderweiss WonderweissMargera Do you remember the instructions I mentioned about a month ago, Ulquiorra Yes Put it into action Ill give you the final say Take with you whomever you like Understood Oh yes Do you wish to go as well Grimmjow Baldy!

How many times do you think you died just now! I know! You think that Soul Reapers have the godly ability to keep on dying, dont you Well, they dont, baldy! Shut up Dinner! Gather round! The guy who gets here last has to wash the dishes! Oh! So, Hiyori, is Ichigo making progress in maintaining his Hollow transformation You can tell by looking! Not at all!

I want to ask you one thing, Grimmjow What happened to your arm I discarded it Its unnecessary to kill you with two arms I see Then I dont need to hold back! If you dont want to die, then dont! Right now, the amount of time I can maintain a Hollow transformation is eleven seconds flat! I have to settle this within that time! Wh-What is that! Sorry I dont have time to explain Getsugatensho! What is this Its refreshing! Its impossible to take on an Espada without using my Bankai, even if Im using a Gentei Kaijo I told you You cant defeat me one-on-one Dont you understand Shut up! Say something to him Ill really kill him I dont like going two against one Oh yeah What a bother Yammy! Let me take on that kid too! Huh Theyre all so troublesome Lets go four against one! Ill release and take you all on by myself A Zanpakuto release I wont let you! Bankai! Daiguren Hyorinmaru! Strangle! Trepadora! Whats wrong Is that the most damage your attack can do while youre released! You blocked that well! I honestly thought that you couldnt stop it Im a little shocked I guess captains are pretty tough, huh But what if that attack just now had been eight times stronger What Crap Captain! I told you that we should go four against one Oh! Sorry It was four against eight Crap Not yet! There it is! Renji! Hey, Rukia! Renji, what are you doing Didnt you get the notice that the Espada have appeared Well, I did get a notice But I trained a little too much and I exhausted my Spiritual Pressure Were massaging him right now! Yes, yes! You fool! What are you doing! Sorry, but theyre not people you should fight if youre not in good condition So Mr Urahara set out Urahara! Youve overused your powers! Ill go You rest here! B-But! Thats right Its as Abarai says But Abarai is exhausted as well Both of you rest here Instead Ill go This power is not that of a Soul Reaper What did you do in the past month! I told you I dont have time to explain! Youpiece of crap! A Cero! Piece of crap! A Cero! Its over, Grimmjow My mask Its over, Soul Reaper! Mymask Looks like you over did it when you used that power of yours just now You were panting a lot as soon as your mask came off! Its over, Soul Reaper! I took quite a few hits, but in the end You cant defeat me with your power! Why you Its useless This is pathetic Are you really Thirteen Court Guard Squad officers How boring Crap! Aw Im so bored Luppi took all of them for himself Then again, its a bother to go look for other prey Hey! Hey, newbie! What are you doing! Aw Im so bored! Matsumoto! Rangiku! Yumichika! Crap! What are you doing! How repulsive! Why you Crap! Lady, youve got a hot body Im jealous Youre so sexy Maybe Ill punch you full of holes You bastard! Stop! Well I made it in time That sure was close Who are you Oh, hello I didnt introduce myself Lady Inoue! Lady Orihime Inoue! We have finished stabilizing the walls of the Dangai, Precipice World! Please pass through! Okay Be careful Thank you very much! Ill be off! Huh We shall accompany you! What! Its all right You dont have to You are not a ryoka anymore! Youre a guest! A guest It is customary for two Soul Reapers without Hell Butterflies to accompany a guest as the guest comes and goes! You may find this uncomfortable, but please bear with us! Okay Then please lead the way Ive got to hurry Its all right Ive become a little stronger in the past month Im sure Ill be of help now! So wait for me Kurosaki and everyone! Whats this Only two guards Soul Society is unexpectedly incompetent They dont seem to know that its most dangerous when you travel Kisuke Urahara Im the owner of Uraharas Shop, a humble shop that sells cheap sweets Pleased to meet you Oh Theres someone pretty strange Hes from back then Its disappointing that you have two guards But its convenient that the troublesome restrictive currents have been frozen Its not in my nature to rush things just so that we can talk Who are you! Are you an Arrancar! Wait! You have something to tell me, dont you! Thats right, woman I have something to tell you Sotenkishun! Run away! Please run away! B-But Just run away! Please! Ayame! Oh You can even heal injuries that deep Thats quite the power Come with me, woman Wha- Dont talk Say only yes If you say anything besides that, people will die I dont mean you I mean your friends Dont ask anything Dont tell me anything You dont have any privileges The only thing you have is the rope to the guillotine in which your friends have placed their heads Understand this, woman This is not a negotiation This is an order Lord Aizen wants your power Ive been ordered to bring you back unharmed Ill just tell you once more Come with me, woman Hey everyone, how about a massage from a mod soul Your fatigue will be cured in one minute! Its true! My body feels really light! What are you doing, Renji They helped me out earlier, so Im helping them with their business You fools! - Were very sorry! - Were very sorry! ARRANCAR ENCYCLOPEDIA The Arrancar Encyclopedia GRIMMJOW If an Arrancar is born stronger 	than an existing Espada, they switch places Recently, Grimmjow got his arm cut off So Luppi became the new Number Six in his place LUPPI I knew that I would become 	an Espada sooner or later Oh We seem like-minded For some reason, the other Espada hate me I dont really like you either What"
" The showdown with the Arrancars is in the winter Ichigo, Sado, Ishida, Rukia, and Orihime  are undergoing intense training to get as strong as possible in what little time they have Meanwhile, Hitsugayas advance troops remain in Karakura Town and fight the powerful Hollows who appear as they prepare for the showdown As that happens, the situation suddenly changes Several Espada appear in Karakura Town Hitsugaya and the others confront them But Luppi, the new Number Six, releases his Zanpakuto, Trepadora, and defeats Hitsugaya But what if that attack just now had been eight times stronger What Matsumoto! Yumichika! Crap! What are you doing! Rangiku and the others are in great danger, and then Kisuke Urahara appears before them Well I made it in time That sure was close Meanwhile, Ichigo leaves his training mid-way to fight Grimmjow And while the battle continues to unfold across Karakura Town, Orihime is heading to the World of the Living from Soul Society to join the fight But someone unexpected ambushes her in the Senkaimon Come with me, woman Wha-! Well That surprised me What was that attack just now Ive never seen it before Ill tell you! That was called a Bala! We solidify our Spiritual Pressure and hit the enemy with it! Its not as strong as a Cero But its twenty times faster! Hey, whats wrong! Can you dodge this! You cant, can you! Die! Die, you clogged bastard!  - My, my I was going to kill the guy that interfered with me But Yammy Whatever the case, hes not alive Oh well! Lets continue what we were doing, shall we lady You really are pathetic Even though that clogged bastard saved you, you immediately got caught again Oh well You cant escape if its eight against three You Ive been thinking about it, and youre really talkative What about it I hate talkative men Theyre kind of disgusting Lady Have you forgotten that Ive caught you If you make me upset, Ill skewer you Wh-What is this! Youve let your guard down against opponents who youve injured Havent you ever heard of being ready-minded Youre still alive Hyorinmaru is the strongest of the ice-type Zanpakuto Even if it breaks, as long as theres water, it can be reborn a countless number of times You have no chance of winning anymore Ive had a lot of time to prepare Youve given me too much time If your weapon is eight arms Then my weapon is all the water within the atmosphere! Sennen Hyoro! Too bad Guess eight arms just werent enough Captain! Wh-What! Luppi was defeated! Crap! Thats what happens when you underestimate your enemy, stupid! At this rate Lord Aizens going to be furious! You bastard! Why Why am I still alive Who knows Are you making fun of me! Im the one asking questions here! Dont question me back! Idiot! Hes been torn to pieces I saw you use that attack countless times It wont hit me anymore It doesnt make sense to you, does it In your flurry of Bala, you felt all of them connect But youre wondering why Im still alive The answer isthis Wha- Wha-! Its a portable gigai! What is that! Ive never seen or heard of such a thing! Thats because Ive never shown it to anyone since creating it Well, I created it as a test, but this is pretty difficult to use I dont think that anyone besides myself can use it! Its also difficult to get the timing right when I want to use it to take my place So how well did I use it Did you know when I switched places with it Y-You piece of crap! You just dont understand I told you That wont hit me anymore Earlier, I analyzed the reishi structure of your technique Ive even analyzed how your muscles move when you fire it As long as I know these two things, I can dodge it and even match your timing to cancel it out WellIts pretty difficult, though Now then Shall we finish this Crap It seems that once that mask breaks, you cant bring it back! No, youre taking your stance to bring it out, so I guess thats not the case But youve either taken too much damage, or youve spent all your Spiritual Pressure Or maybe you have a limit to how many times you can use it I dont know why, but that mask You cant bring it out anymore Isnt that right Dont worry Its a Cero at close range Ill wipe away that mask-wearing head of yours! Wha-! Tsuginomai Hakuren Hakuren Ichigo! Thats incredible power When did you Dont speak Its difficult to get you free as is Youll just make it more difficult You seem to be using a pretty ridiculous power, too Youre all rickety Shut up Ichigo Dont underestimate me, Soul Reaper Did you think you could kill me by freezing me under a thin sheet of ice! Dont be foolish! Rukia! Wh-What happened! Sheesh I really dont like interfering in Soul Reaper fights, but I have no choice I cant ignore you if youre making so much noise Hirako Who are you Are you a friend of theirs Why would I be Well then who are you It doesnt matter who I am Thats true Whoever you are Im going to kill you anyway! Hold back a little when you fight If you keep destroying things when I dodge, Ill get distracted and wont be able to dodge You call that dodging, do you! Jeez What a hot-blooded guy That mask You really are one of his friends! Dont make me repeat myself It doesnt matter who I am! Sorry, Arrancar Impossible Youre pretty strong so Im not going to hold back A Cero! Damn Damn! Damn! Damn! So you hit it with your own Cero right before it hit to reduce the damage Thats pretty good Grind! Ulquiorra! Our mission is complete Were leaving Tsk! Our missions completed Negacion! Too bad, Captain You couldnt kill me Dont forget my face When we meet again Ill twist off that little head of yours and crush it! Ill remember that you said that you were going to finish this! Well finish this the next time we meet Ill crush you! Dammit! Captain! Thank you very much We still havent defeated them Itll only get more troublesome Crap! What an inelegant ending There are some traces of Spiritual Pressure It seems he gained a new power Butis that the best he can do Its over You have no means to fight anymore The sun has fallen into our hands I had many things that I wanted to do I wish I had at least five lives Kurosaki, I ARRANCAR ENCYCLOPEDIA HOGYOKU In this episode HOGYOKU I shall explain what the Hogyoku is No way When the Hogyoku temporarily  fuses with a person who has the Spiritual Pressure of a captain For an instant, it displays the same power as if it were completely awake The Arrancar to be born by that power is Wonderweiss For Lord Aizen, I"
" As for the laundry, the towels are in the upper right drawer Put the washed towels in the bottom drawer Take out the kitchen garbage on Tuesday and Thursday by 8:00 AM If not, it may not be taken away You should wrap leftovers in plastic wrap and put them in the refrigerator Period All right That about covers it, I guess Rangiku and Toshiro will make a mess of things if theyre left alone Im giving you this While youre wearing this, itll place a special spiritual membrane around you that will prevent anyone but us Arrancars from detecting you At the same time, youll be able to pass through objects at will Wear it and dont take it off Yes Ill give you a twelve-hour reprieve During that time, Ill allow you to say goodbye to only one person But If that person realizes what youre doing, I will consider it a violation of my order Your time limit is midnight Settle everything by then and go to the place I told you to go Dont forget You can only say goodbye to one person That hurts! I told you, thats enough! Let go of me! I cant do that! Shut up! Youre tightening my bandages too Dont choke me  Good job, Ururu! Make him pass out! Stop! Ikkaku! Crap! Let go of Ikkaku! Youre injured I want you to stay still, Ayasegawa!  Let go, let go, let go! You shouldnt move, either! Oh my, oh dear, Lirin, you mustnt do that Yumichika is injured You must be more gentle when you restrain him What are you saying! Its his fault for not listening to me! Is Yumichika all right No problem Dont say such irresponsible things! No! Yumichika, calm down! Ill rewrap your bandages Shut up! My, my Theyre noisy wherever they go Kisuke Urahara Hes a mysterious man Hes been thinking about something ever since the Arrancars disappeared Anyway We were lucky that this is all that we suffered after all those Espada attacked We underestimated them Theyre already prepared! Weve got to hurry our battle preparations But how quickly can we get completely prepared Matsumoto! Oh Yes Did you get in touch with Soul Society! Well Oh, sorry! What are you doing! Huh Well, I seemed to have bumped into something What would you bump into here! How stupid Thats odd I thought it felt kind of squishy Only Arrancars will be able to detect you At the same time, youll be able to pass through objects at will Forgot something Forgot something Hey, Mizuiro, quickly, quickly!  Umm  If you dont hurry Could you stop singing that song, Keigo Also, dont talk to Forgot something Hey Hey! Forgot something Hey Hey! Hey, please cut that out, Mr Asano Oh yeah! They cant see me right now I told you Stop being formal with me Were friends, arent we Yes, yes I understand, Mr Asano You dont understand Whats wrong Whys this chair on the floor Did Ichigo come to school Cant be Someone probably bumped into it Yeahbut Anyway, its strange that Chad, Inoue, Kuchiki, and, for some reason, Ishida all took off from school! Oh! Could it be that theyre doing something fun together We really are being left out! Dont group me in with you What! Besides We may not be the only ones who have been left out Huh Umm What Well For example Arisawa Besides We may not be the only ones who have been left out For example Arisawa Come on! Dont dawdle! Yes!  Yes! Tatsuki Where are you kicking Go get it! Hey, Arisawa! What are you doing! Yes! Dont forget You can only say goodbye to one person  Thats odd I cant contact Inoue in Soul Society I wonder if theres Spiritual Wave interference This is the best I can do My techniques dont heal Theyre actually a form of spatial regression In order to activate my techniques, I need to specify exactly what I want to regress Right now, Ichigos wound has Arrancar Spiritual Pressure mixed in with his own Spiritual Pressure With him in this state, this is the best I can regress it In order to get him out of this condition as quickly as possible, we need to get as far away from him as we can Since we have Spiritual Pressure that is similar to that of Hollows Take him home and let him get some rest That is the best treatment for him right now Okay I understand Ichigo Who are they What kind of power are you trying to obtain Why did the Arrancars stop fighting halfway through and leave There are lots of things I dont know All right! Anyway, Ill stop by Inoues house I said you cant! Brother needs rest! But But Karin He might wake up! Right But U-Umm Can we eat dinner here Yeah Please do that Im sure Ichigo will be pleased Umm Whats wrong Well actually Ive made some for you, too! Wow! Whats this! Doesnt it look delicious Um But I actually need to get going What! Im still not hungr- What was that noise just now See Rukia, you are hungry! No, well Umm Since you made it, I guess Ill have some Wow! Thank you, Rukia! Come on, Karin! Bring the tray! Oh, right! M-Mr Kurosaki! Hey, Rukia!

What a waste  Thank you very much OhRukia Its cold tonight If youre going out, be careful not to catch a cold Okay All right! There we go I came here WellKurosaki I came to say goodbye Actually, I wanted to say goodbye to Tatsuki, Sado, Ishida, Kuchiki, and many other people, but I see Yuzu and Karin ate dinner here today I suppose theyd want to They were sad that you werent around for so long They wanted to eat dinner with you in your room BLUSH Kurosakisroom Come to think of it, this is the first time Ive come to Kurosakis room alone It smells like him Its no good I cant do it Im no good Im doing this even though its the end Kurosaki, I had a lot of things that I wanted to do I wanted to become a schoolteacher I wanted to become an astronaut I wanted to be a cake maker I wanted to go to a doughnut shop that had all kinds of doughnuts and say I wanted everything I also wanted to go to an ice cream shop and say that I wanted everything I wish I had five lives! I would be born in a different town each time Id fill my stomach with different things each time Id have a different job each time And each time Id fall in love with the same person Thank you, Kurosaki Good-bye Hmm Im not getting through Your Soul Pager is too old Mine is a new one that wont break even if an elephant were to step on it! But its design is terrible! I feel sorry for you for not being able to realize how great it is! Then does yours get through Its out of range! Then dont brag!  Illustrated guide to Soul Reapers!   Hey, listen to this! Yesterday, there were huge noises in town That was Ikkaku and the others fighting again, wasnt it Is that so Who are they 001 IKKAKU A spy with a license to kill Or Is he the attendant of a former shogun who fights evil He might be your brother in law "
" Ichigo and his friends undergo intense training in preparation for the showdown in the winter Aizen suddenly sends an  elite group of Arrancars before them Hitsugayas advance troops  and Ichigo confront them, but they have trouble fighting the Espada But Aizens true goal was to  take Orihime Inoue to Hueco Mundo Orihime gives into Ulquiorras threats  and agrees to go to Hueco Mundo She is given twelve hours to  tell one person goodbye And so Orihime goes to Ichigo Thank you, Kurosaki Good-bye W-What was that Damn it That hurt Anyway, screaming in my sleep  and falling out of bed is so clichédI Aw My head hurts Its healed Who did it! This Spiritual Pressure It was probably Orihime Inoue Come immediately, Kurosaki  Its an emergency RANGIKU MATSUMOTO  ORIHIME INOUE Sorry to keep you waiting Rukia Why is everyone gathered here in Inoues room Wheres Inoue Well What is the status of the  Spiritual Wave interference Yes Weve managed to regulate it Put me through Ukitake  This isnt the Head Captain I had him switch over to me What was your reason for that Its because Im the last person  who saw Orihime Inoue before she went into the Senkaimon  in order to go over to your side Judging from your reaction,  it doesnt seem like shes arrived there Whats the meaning of this, Ukitake! Where did Inoue disappear to! Do you know anything! Ill tell you my assessment The two guards I had placed with her when she went through the Senkaimon came back alive According to them We believe that Orihime Inoue has either been abducted  or killed by the Arrancars Killed! Captain Ukitake!  Thats jumping to conclusions! I know I dont want to say this either I was just stating the  worst possible scenario According to our information, Orihime Inoue was attacked by an Arrancar and then disappeared with the Arrancar Youve got to be kidding! Thats all you have! She disappeared Theres no proof,  but you say that shes dead! Dont make such assumptions! Take a look at this! I was seriously injured  in yesterdays battle! No one here could  heal my wounds! But when I woke up this morning,  it had been healed without a trace! Furthermore Here! On my wrist! Theres still some of  Inoues Spiritual Pressure! Are you still going to say  that Inoues dead now! I see That is unfortunate Unfortunate  What do you mean by that! If it is as you say,  then Orihime Inoue is indeed alive But at the same time, it also means that this is an act of treachery Treachery! If she had been abducted,  she wouldnt have had the time to meet you In short, the fact that she healed  your wounds and disappeared means that Orihime Inoue went  to the Arrancars of her own accord You idiot! Stop! Youll just worsen your position  if you talk any more I understand what youre saying,  Head Captain Yamamoto Therefore I, Hitsugaya advance troop member  and Squad 6 Lieutenant Renji Abarai, will head to Hueco Mundo to bring  the traitor, Orihime Inoue, to her senses! Renji You mustnt We now know that the Arrancars  are ready for battle All the members of the  Hitsugaya advance troop are to return immediately  and defend Soul Society Are you saying that  you want us to abandon Inoue Indeed We cannot risk the whole world over one life Unfortunately, Head Captain,  I cannot follow that order! I thought so I thought this may happen,  so Im glad that I have prepared for it Captain! Thats how things stand All of you, head back Dont fight us Weve been ordered to take you  back by force if necessary All right Then I wont ask  Soul Society to help me, but at least tell me how  I can get into Hueco Mundo Inoue is our friend! Ill go save her myself! Ichigo You mustnt! What! We need your help in this battle I wont allow you to plot your own  course of action and die for nothing! Stand by until you receive orders! That is all! Lets go Ichigo Im sorry Orihime! Oh! No Sorry Orihime Where did you go, Orihime Shinji! This was on the ground outside! Whats this I dont know! Dont pick up things if you  dont know what they are! But, but it was right in front of our place I just had to pick it up! Say, what is it Bandages Ichigo Why would he go through  the trouble to do this Bandages Why bandages Why, why bandages THANKS Why, why, why, why, why bandages! Hey, why That idiot What should we do  What should we do Definitely dinner first Not a bath No! Before that,  a passionate embrace by me! Anyway Lets Ichi-go! How unfortunate I missed! Oh Sorry Brother Have some dinner Otherwise Yuzu wont be  able to clear the table Sorry  I dont feel like eating today Yuzu made all of your favorites Sorry, Yuzu I-Its all right  You dont need to apologize! Ill put it in the refrigerator  Eat it when you feel hungry! Come on Lets go! Come dad, you too! Oh! O-Okay Thats amazing, Ichigo! You just apologized three times! Three! Thats an amazing new Japanese record! Whats wrong  Youre acting gloomy! I know Its that, isnt it! Are you constipated! Thats lame Thats lame, brother! Oh! You want to fight! Sorry Could you move from there O-Oh Sorry, sorry! Hey, what is this! Youre kind of out of it! Oh Palm reading Then Ill take a look at mine, too Kurosaki Its been a while since Ive seen you Hasnt it I was sad I didnt think  that you wanted to graduate You havent been hospitalized  due to an accident, have you Amazing   What do you have to say! Shes pounding on him   Come on! Come on! Hey, say something! You changed your hairstyle Thanks for noticing! I changed it three weeks ago, idiot! Her hand looks sore It does Ichigo, Ichigo, Ichigo, Ichigo Ichigo! Its been a while Its really been a while! What have you been doing  during the month you took off We were worried about you!  You didnt answer your cell phone, either Sorry I was a little busy What are you doing, Mizuiro Oh yeah! I was able to get some tickets  for the screening of Bad Shield 2 When is that Huh Its December 5th All right Ill come back by then Huh Thank you, Mizuiro Come back by then Ichigo! Tatsuki What is it, Tatsuki Orihimes gone! Shes not at home or anywhere! Her presence has disappeared! Ive been looking all over the place,  but shes not anywhere! You know where Orihime went, dont you What do you mean Why would I know! Besides, did she really disappear Look for her again Cut it out! Ive always been able to sense her,  but her presence has disappeared! I cant sense her nearby! For a while, I could only faintly sense her It was as if she was on the  other side of some wall But yesterday, she suddenly vanished! You know something, dont you! Ichigo! Stop being so pesky!  I told you, I dont know! You think I dont know, dont you Ive seen you! You wear a black kimono! And you fight strange people! Ichigo Thats enough Tell me everything youre hiding This doesnt concern you Arisawa! Stop! What are you doing! Are you all right What am I! What exactly am I! What am I to you! Arent I your buddy! Arent I your friend! Ive saved you many times  when youve cried! Ive seen you troubled many times! Ive saved you many, many times! So dont hide things from me You idiot! Ichigo Sorry Keigo Mizuiro Take care of Tatsuki And dont bother with me You idiot You idiot! Welcome I thought that it was  about time you came Kurosaki Why did you think that You thought that I might know  a way into Hueco Mundo Youre correct Ive made preparations I was afraid that Aizen  would go after Inoues power So I left her out of this battle But I was too late Taking her feelings into consideration,  it was a mistake to leave her out I shall do anything I can to help you Is that all right Youll be going against  Soul Societys judgment Im here because I went against them in the first place Youre looking pretty glum, 	Kurosaki! Ishida! Why are you here Isnt it obvious Were here to go to Hueco Mundo Chad! We heard the details from Mr Urahara Were going too Yeah You cant! I appreciate your concern, though Chad Ishida At your strength Ichigo Do you still think that Im not strong enough Believe in us Chad Dont take this on by yourself This is what friends are for! All right! Is everyone ready It seems like youre finally prepared Are you ready There are terrifying Hollows waiting  for you in Hueco Mundo! Brace yourself! All right! Hey, why are leading us, Kon! Are you going with us to Hueco Mundo Sorry I cant do that I have the important role of  protecting the girls of this town! You arent going, are you Illustrated guide to Soul Reapers! Captain You appeared at a really appropriate time back there, but Were you hiding with Captain Zaraki,  waiting for your time to appear Renji! Dont be rude! No Thats exactly right What! What! Thats part of my job You did that for us, Brother! I dont mind I killed lots of time with Captain Zaraki"
" Ichigo and his friends   undergo intense training in preparation for  the showdown in the winter Aizen suddenly sends an elite group  of Arrancars before them But the Arrancars suddenly  retreat in the midsts of battle Aizen was after Orihime and  	the Espadas attack was a diversion Orihime is captured by Ulquiorra  and taken to Hueco Mundo Ichigo and his friends  realize Orihimes disappearance and try to go to save her, but Genryusai forbids them from taking action You mustnt! We need your help in this battle I wont allow you to plot your own course of action and die for nothing! Meanwhile, Tatsuki realizes that Orihime is gone and presses Ichigo about it You know where Orihime went, dont you Thats enough Tell me everything youre hiding This doesnt concern you Ichigo decides to go to Hueco Mundo by himself and visits Uraharas Shop for help Welcome I thought that it was about time you came Waiting there for him were Ishida and Sado Do you still think that Im not strong enough Believe in us Chad Dont take this on by yourself This is what friends are for! All right! Is everyone ready It seems like youre finally prepared URAHARAS SHOP That was Ichigowasnt it Yeah Wh-What is he doing here We came here to find out, didnt we! Well, thats true Honestly Ichigo sure is hopeless Its completely obvious that hes hiding something! Hes practically telling us that hes going to do something Thats because hes an idiot Arisawa, I dont think you can really talk about his ridiculous straightforwardness And dont bother with me Just what does Ichigo think I am! This isnt like you Dont you want to know where Ichigos going Well In that case In that case Well Well Youre the one who brought this up What are you saying We followed Ichigo all the way here What should we do, Arisawa What should we do What will we do What should we do at a time like this! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Shut up! No, Arisawa! Dont get mad for real! Were going to go, of course Youre finally acting more like yourself, Arisawa Shut up All right Lets go! Ichigo Now then, I shall now open the path to Hueco Mundo! Lirin and you others, its dangerous, so stand back a little! Stand back! What! This doesnt happen often, so I wanted to see it up close! Thats right! Its rare to get such good seats! No problem I cant let you do that! What! Hey, hey! What are you doing! I can walk on my own Were being left out Its not fair! Storeowner! Things are okay over here! All right! Well then In my right hand, the stone that connects the worlds In my left hand, the blade that binds existence The black-haired shepherd The chair of the noose I strike the ibis when the clouds gather This hole that the Arrancars come and go through it is called a Garganta Inside, there is no path, and there are wild reishi currents swirling around Move through it by making footing out of reishi If you move towards the darkness, you should reach Hueco Mundo All right Mr Urahara Can you take care of everyone at home for me I want you to tell them not to worry about me All right What about your friends Ill apologize to them when I get back All right Well, go give it your best! Be careful Yeah Lets go! So thats it Why dont you come out about now Umm When did you notice us Since before you came here I knew that you were following Kurosaki, so I left the store unlocked My, my Kurosaki has been naïve, as usual He thinks that hes cut his ties just by being a little cold Now then I guess I should do my job Welcome to our castle, Las Noches Orihime Inouewas it Yes Sorry this is so sudden, but Orihime, could you show me your power Yes What was that just now It felt as if my strength was being sucked out of my body It seems like there are some people who dont like the fact that I brought you here Isnt that right, Luppi Of course Our entire battle was a diversion so that we could bring this woman here! I cant agree to that Sorry I didnt expect you to get so beaten up Ah, I know Orihime, in order to clearly show off your power I want you to heal Grimmjows left arm Impossible! Thats crazy, Lord Aizen! Grimmjow! Director General Tosen turned his arm to ashes! How is she going to heal something thats been wiped out! Shes not a god! Sotenkishun Ireject Hey! Are you listening, woman! If youre just putting on an act so you can save yourself, then cut it out! If you cant do it, Ill kill you! If your power isnt real, then theres no reason to keep someone like you alive H-How! This is beyond the level of healing What did you do, woman! Dont you understand Ulquiorra thinks its time regression or space regression Yes Impossible Theres no way a human has such advanced power! Thats right Its neither This is a rejection of phenomenon Her power limits, rejects, and negates events that happen to an object She has the power to return things to their state before things happened to them Its above time regression and space regression It easily overcomes the limits of Gods established phenomena It is a power that encroaches on the realm of the gods Hey, woman Fix one more part of me What are you doing, Grimmjow Huh Wha-! G-Grimmjowyou bastard Thats how it is So longformer Number Six Its back! My powers back! Im Seis! Seis Espada, Grimmjow! Beyond this point is Hueco Mundo Crap! He talked about making footing with reishi as if it was easy! Im really terrible at little things like this! Are you all right, Chad! Not a problem Sorry! My, my Thats pathetic Cant you make your footing a little better Shut up! I told you Im not good at things like this! Anyway, what is that thing you have! Youre cheating, arent you! Its a variation of the Hirenkyaku This is nothing Make one for me, too! Sorry Your inability to control Spiritual Pressure means that you couldnt use this What You talk as if I dont have any powers! Am I wrong You cant even make your own footing properly Im going to kill you! Ill go on ahead of you Ishida I heard from Mr Urahara that you made an agreement with your father In exchange for his training, you wouldnt involve yourself with Soul Reapers or their associates So why are you here Whats that! I never heard about that before, Ishida! Is that true Training, huh Yeah, Thats right Hello Sorry to disturb you at this hour Well, its still evening, though M-Mr Urahara! Oh Your father isnt here This is lucky! What do you want with me Oh, thats it! Whats it! Inoue was abducted by the Arrancars! More accurately, the Arrancars did it on Sosuke Aizens command Kurosaki is probably going to go and save her by himself Hes probably going to come to me for a way to get into Hueco Mundo tonight Please leave Huh Youre trying to tell me to go with Kurosaki to Hueco Mundo, right But right now, I cant involve myself with Soul Reapers Please leave! Ill save Inoue by myself if I have to By himself Mr Urahara, what did you just say Kurosakis by himself Yes Soul Society isnt touching this incident Kurosaki decided to head into enemy territory by himself Is that so Then that changes things Why Even though Soul Society isnt touching this, that doesnt change the fact that Im a Soul Reaper! No Youre a Substitute Soul Reaper Furthermore, Soul Society has abandoned you In other words Right now, youre not a Soul Reaper or one of their associates Hence even if I associate myself with you, it doesnt go against my contract Thats a forced argument Id like to think of it as finding a hole in my contract Thats called a forced argument! Shut up! Whose side are you on Your enemys! How typical of Ishida Hey! It looks like Ishida ran away How did you get in Kurosaki Oh! Whats this Thats the first time you ever called me that Why the change in attitude Answer my question Im asking you how you got in That attire You got your powers back Pretty much! I look good, dont I It makes me want to throw up Thank you Arent you going to read the letter How silly I know what it says without having to read it You let him go on purpose, didnt you Its none of your concern I brought back his Quincy powers Whether he makes use of it or suppresses it is up to him Whether he lives or dies is of no concern What a horrible father you are I think Im much better than you Yeah I know I was told to stay quiet here, but theres nothing for me to do Im hungry I wonder if it was really a good idea for me to come here I wonder if the battle got worse because I healed those people No But, right now, I have to make them think that Im of use to them, no matter what At least until everyones prepared for battle Theyve come I wanted to go to Hueco Mundo, too It cant be helped Our gigai were broken in the previous battle What a waste Then lets get new ones made This time, I want a sexy one I want a handsome one Know your place Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! Hey Ishida, you still smoke You already quit, didnt you Yeah I dont smoke unless its a memorial day Huh Come to think of it, this is a hospital NO SMOKING INSIDE HOSPITAL Thats not a problem No Do you really think that saying that makes things any better"
" Ichigo and his friends are suddenly attacked by an elite group of Arrancars During the battle, Orihime is taken to Hueco Mundo Ichigo and his friends realize Orihimes disappearance and try to go to save her, but Genryusai forbids them from taking action Furthermore, Genryusai determines that the Arrancars are prepared for battle He orders Rukia and Hitsugayas 	advance troops to return to Soul Society Ichigo is left alone in the World of the Living He ignores Genryusais orders and decides to go to Hueco Mundo by himself Ichigo goes to Uraharas Shop for a way to get into Hueco Mundo Waiting there for him were Ishida and Sado They too are prepared to go to Hueco Mundo Believe in us It seems like youre finally prepared Lets go! I wonder if it was really a good idea for me to come here I wonder if the battle got worse because I healed those people No But, right now, I have to make them think that Im of use to them, no matter what At least until everyones prepared for battle Huh! Whats this We arrived inside a pretty well-made building I imaged Hueco Mundo to be a little more disorganized Keep your voice down, Kurosaki! Someone should have noticed us after the noise we made coming in! Is this really Hueco Mundo Are you listening, Kurosaki! Im listening! Anyway, youre talking louder than I am! Oh Sorry Well, this will be a lot quicker if they notice were here We can just catch the first guy who comes out and make him tell us where Inoue is Hey! If anyones here, come out! Kurosaki! Stop standing around and look for someone! Hey! Youre right Hey, Sado, too! Hey, wait! All right It looks safe Hey! Is anyone here! Kurosaki! What It looks safe, right Then theres no problem As I keep saying, dont you have any sense of caution! AwShut up Ishida, calm down I am calm! Run! Ishida! How could you do that! Its your fault to begin with! Hey! Are you trying to blame this on me! Nows not the time to argue - I know! - I know! Its a side path! What should we do Anythings fine! Lets go! Sado! Ishida! Thanks You saved me Jeez What an old-fashioned trap And whos the one who fell for that old-fashioned trap! Im sorry about that Well, as long as you understand! Lets hurry ahead Anyway, this path looks safe How long does this hallway continue Dont ask me Weve gone in pretty far We should find something sooner or later Still Theres no sign of anyone at all Did we wander into somewhere strange Dont let your guard down, Kurosaki I know! Im being careful Huh This isthe same thing that happened earlier Kurosaki, what do you think that sound is I dont want to imagine what it is I thought so! Jeez What truly basic traps! Nows not the time to be impressed! Im not impressed! Chad! Leave this to me! Chad! Nice, Chad! Its not nice! I told you to not let your guard down! All right, all right! I was at fault this time! Wait, Kurosaki! Im not finished talking to you! Who are you Ah! Theyve shown up! Wh-Why are we running away! We finally encountered an enemy! Its the perfect chance to get information! Are you stupid! If we fight in this narrow place, whatll we do if the building collapses We wont do anything! Its not a problem if it collapses! You really are stupid! Didnt you notice while we were walking around! There arent any windows in this long corridor! So Were underground! Is there any other reason why there wouldnt be any windows! So what if its underground! Fighting here is not our best option! Weve got to wait until we come to a wide area Lets go through, Ishida! A hall All right! You dont have any complaints about this place do you, Ishida! Stairs! It might connect to the outside! Ill go check! Oh! Hey! Where are you intruders going Another one! I guess there wouldnt be only one in a place this wide It seems theyve trapped us in between Dont say that, idiot! Are they Arrancars, too They seem more like Hollows than the ones that came to the World of the Living Well, thats all right AnywayChad, Ishida, you two should stand ba-- Wh-What are you doing, Chad! Youre the one whos going to stand back, Ichigo Were going to handle this What are you saying Save your stamina until we find Inoue Mr Urahara gave me information about the Arrancars The guys that the Arrancar named Grimmjow brought with him were a mixed team of Gillians and Adjuchas Menos Grande usually turn into humanoids when they become Arrancars But it seems that only the Vasto Lordes, the highest ranking Hollows, become humanoids 100% of the time As for the other two ranks, even if they become Arrancars, many dont become completely humanoid Also The lower their intelligence, the closer to Hollows they become Ishida! I cant ignore that Demora is one thing But I, Iceringer, have low intelligence I cant ignore that at all Ice! Dont talk as if Im the only one whos stupid! Dont run away! We cant become humanoid! We discarded our human forms so that we could gain enormous power! Dont underestimate me, humans Ishida! Chad! Shut up! Shut up and watch, Kurosaki! You bastard! Im your opponent! Ishida! What are you doing! I told you, youre in the way! What! Chad! You, too! Get out of the way You dont have time to be concerned about others! Chad! Ichigo! Kurosaki, keep out of this! You two This guy I thought that it was just a regular slap, but hes surrounding his hand with reishi when he attacks! Its a more troublesome attack than it looks I cant construct my spirit weapon with the reishi disturbance If I could only gain a little distance Sado! A slow attack He cant keep up with my Sonido Ive already measured your fighting power One has power, but is slow The other is fast, but lacks power! Here I go! Now! What Why is he just standing there Have you given up, you fool! Wait, Demora! My, my Compatibility is important Ive been fighting the same enemy for a while, so I forgot the most basic thing Were fighting two-on-two If we have difficulty fighting one enemy, we just have to trade off and fight the one thats easier to fight Power against power Speed against speed Now then Lets retaliate Wh-What is that Ishida! Is that a bow Is it a bow, you ask Of course What weapon would I use besides a bow This is my new spirit bow Ginreikojaku I shouldnt have destroyed your mask You looked more pleasant when you had it on Whats wrong Arent you going to show off your strength Is that all youve got Crap You damn human! Is that a Sonido As expected, youre fast Impossible! Theres no way that a human can keep up with the speed of a Sonido Sorry Unfortunately, Im no ordinary human Im a Quincy This is called a Hirenkyaku Its a Quincy high-speed maneuvering technique Personally, I think its better than the Soul Reapers flash step A Quincy! An advanced class human! I dont know anything about that! You dont know I see Youre embarrassingly ignorant, arent you Shut up! Even if you can keep up with my Sonido, nothing changes As long as your bow cannot guard against my Uña Tirotea! Oh! Are you going to shoot down all of my Uña Tirotea! What a simple solution! Youre like a child, Quincy! Try your best! But Ill tell you one thing! My Uña Tirotea fires 108 shots in a row Im going to see how long you can keep this up I see Then let me tell you one thing My Ginrei Kojaku fires 1200 shots in a row Wha-- Crap! Crap! I cant lose to a small guy like you! Thats impossible! Is that it The fact that you used that at this stage means that was your final attack Now its my turn to attack Sorry I really dont like finishing off enemies who dont have any will to fight But it seems that this time I cant be so soft ElDirecto It looks like all of the Espada will finally appear New guys are going to appear Soul Reaper captains, Visoreds, the Espada With this many people, someones probably going to disappear Be careful, Kurosaki In your case, you cant let your guard down Again! Illustrated guide to Soul Reapers! Today, I, Marechiyo Omaeda, 	am going to introduce my family MARECHIYO OMAEDA FATHER  MARENOSHIN My father, Marenoshin All right! All right! MOTHER  MAREKA My mother, Mareka Hello My older sister, Maremi OLDER SISTER  MAREMI Oh my My younger brother, 	Marejirosaburo YOUNGER BROTHER  MAREJIROSABURO Hello And my unbecoming 	younger sister, Mareyo YOUNGER SISTER  MAREYO Please look after my older brother Shes the only one whos unseemly Theres something wrong with this family "
" Orihime has been abducted by the Arrancars In order to save her, Ichigo, Ishida, and Sado have marched into Hueco Mundo, the world of the Hollows The first place that Ichigo and his friends came to upon exiting the Garganta was an underground passageway Afterwards, Ichigo and his friends encounter many traps placed there, and new Arrancars appear before them Where are you intruders going This is my new spirit bow… Ginreikojaku Is that all youve got Thats impossible! Sorry… I really dont like finishing off enemies who dont have any will to fight But it seems that this time I cant be so soft ElDirecto Its over Chad… Crap… Damn human… I told you that I was a Quincy, Arrancar The reason I havent exterminated you is so you can tell Aizen that Soul Reapers arent the ones he should truly be afraid of… Its Quincies! What! Whats this! Whats going on! Its collapsing! Thats because you guys overdid it! Whos the one who was going on about how we were underground! Youre wrong Huh This room is made this way We guard this place… If there are people who are trying to sneak into Las Noches, we are to eliminate them If we lose, we are to disappear along with this room Remember that, humans These are the sort of people youre fighting against There is no end to this battle There is no victory for you Anyway, lets get out of here! Quickly! “Be afraid,” huh Thats a pretty extreme claim, Quincy But youve got one thing wrong… Lord Aizen fears nothing That is why we gather before him We were born out of fear To us, his fearless pace is as bright as the moonlight We managed to get out… Aw man, I feel gross! So thisis Hueco Mundo Its a pretty lonely place, isnt it Theres nothing here Its completely white There are plants here… Theyre withered, though No, this is… Its made out of something like quartz H-Hey! Whats wrong Th-This is… A castle… A palace So thats the place that guy was talking about, Las Noches Its huge… Its hard to tell how far away we are from it Im glad were at a distance where we can see it in its entirety Does being able to see it make a difference Its comforting A lot more than not being able to see it Thats right I dont care either way Anyway, its safe to assume that Inoues somewhere in there, right Probably… There doesnt seem to be anywhere else they could hide her Right… Lets run… If we wait around, we might get into another fight It seems we have intruders Intruders Underground Path 22 collapsed Twenty two! Theyve broken into a pretty far off place! Indeed… It would have been interesting if they had broken into the room with the Hogyoku That would be great! Shut up! Im tired… Dont talk so loudly Good morning, Espada We have an enemy attack Shall we have some tea first Its nice that we can clearly see what were headed towards, but its pretty far away Yeah… We can see it… Well get there sooner or later Yeah… It doesnt seem like were getting any closer That just means that its pretty far away You said that yourself earlier! Well, thats true… Say… What is it this time! Nothing… I was just going to say that it really is far away You dont have to talk so loudly Put up with it and just run! We dont know when the enemy will attack! Its problematic if you dont concentrate more! Youve been acting unusually condescendingly since weve arrived here Thats not true! Im just telling you to be a little more cautious! Yeah, yeah… Whats wrong Are you tired, Chad What about it Its just some wind, right No… Wh-Whats this Its a sand storm! Or rather, a tornado! I doesnt matter what it is! Run away! – Its no good! – Grab on to something! Crap! Is this one of their traps! I dont know! Theres the possibility that its just a natural phenomenon! Anyway, dont let go! Whats going to happen to us! H-Huh Whats this Are things this quiet in a tornado It cant be… Then whats the meaning of this I thought so! This is a Spiritual Partition! A Spiritual Partition! That thing we used when we went to save Rukia! Why is it here now Ever since then, I carried around a miniature spirit core with me in the event that something like this happened! “In the event” Who are you! Shut up, Kurosaki! Thanks to me, youre safe You havent even thanked me Youve got no right to complain Why are you acting so triumphantly! Anyway, where did you get that from! Oh! Dont tell me that you swiped it from Kukakus place… How rude! I received it from Kukaku! Yeah, yeah, I know… Just kidding Just kidding… Whats with that attitude! If you dont like this, do you want to go outside! Do you have to go as far as to say that! Yeah, I do! Ichigo! What is it, Chad You shouldnt disturb Ishidas concentration Whoa! A crack! Hey, do something! Theres no point in telling me that… I havent learned how to repair it! Crap… I havent used it since that time before I should have studied it a little more! You good-for-nothing! Speak for yourself! Chad, dont be rash! Stop! You saved us… That was a little crazy, though Thank you, Sado Its all right Huh What Has everyone been served Now then… Have a drink and listen to what I have to say Kaname, the images Yes There are three intruders: Uryu Ishida… Yasutora Sado… Ichigo Kurosaki… Are these our enemies Whats this You said that the enemy was attacking, so I wondered what they were like, but theyre still just kids Theyre not very exciting at all Dont underestimate them… Theyre humans who were once called Ryoka The four of them charged into Soul Society by themselves, and battled the Thirteen Court Guard Squads Four One is missing Wheres the last one Its Orihime Inoue Oh So theyve come to save their friend, huh Who cares They look weak Werent you listening Huh Lord Aizen just told us not to underestimate them I didnt mean it like that… Are you scared What did you say! Where are you going, Grimmjow Im going to go and kill them! Shouldnt we squash pests that come in sooner rather than later Lord Aizen still hasnt given any orders Return to your seat Im going to go and crush them for Lord Aizen! Grimmjow… Yes Im glad that youre taking action for me, but Im still talking Could you return to your seat for now Whats wrong I dont hear a response, Grimmjow Jeagerjaques! I see It seems like you understand Espada! As you can see, we have three enemies You mustnt underestimate them, but theres no need to make a fuss about them All of you are to return to your own palaces and do as you always do Dont be arrogant or impatient Just sit and wait for the enemy Dont be afraid No matter what happens, as long as youre with me theyre no match for us! Crap! No matter how much we run, I dont feel like were getting any closer! Is that palace really there! Looking closely… That crystal tree looks as small as a needle If it looks like that from this distance, then in contrast, doesnt that mean that the palace and everything else is terrifyingly huge I-Its not actually a mirage or something, is it Its not a mirage We cant see mirages here To make things easier, should I explain how mirages work You dont need to! When I came here I thought this was a world of death with nothing in it But surprisingly there are small animals Theyre Hollows, though Huh Dont Hollows mainly eat human souls I wonder what these little guys survive on here Here in Hueco Mundo, the reishi density in the air is pretty thick The smaller Hollows probably get the nutrition they need just by breathing The reishi density in the air! You can tell that! The Quincies are a tribe that fights by using the reishi around them We function better when the reishi is denser! I confirmed it in my last battle If I can get a knack for it, I should be able to display my powers better here than in the World of the Living or in Soul Society Oh Thats pretty convenient You function better when theres more reishi Youre like a Hollow! What! Soul Reapers are like that, too! Huh Im different… Just you! Kuchiki recovered her spiritual power in Soul Society! Maybe theres something wrong with Rukia Anyway, the fact that theres a high reishi density means that not only I benefit, but the Arrancars do as well I dont know how many Hollows Aizen has turned into Arrancars or how many he controls But even if he doesnt control them, were still enemies as well as food for the Arrancars The reishi is dense here in Hueco Mundo, so even if we see an ordinary-looking Hollow, we should assume that its much stronger than it looks We must observe them carefully Youve been talking too long! Lets move on! There you go again, as soon as I start talking! Shut up… You can keep talking! Lets go, Chad! Wait! – Wha--! – Wha--! A human! Could it be that there are other humans aside from us! That cant be… Think about that later! Lets go save her! Ladies and gentlemen, were you able to match the faces of the Espada to their respective numbers Im ten and Grimmjow is… Huh At times like this, use this quick memorization chart Ah! This is convenient! Here, here! Give one to me! I wont give one to a Soul Reaper ARRANCAR ENCYCLOPEDIA The Arrancar Encyclopedia Today, I shall tell you about Hueco Mundo HUECO MUNDO  This is the world in which 	the Hollows live Its always night here Its a pretty barren place with white sand deserts and withered trees There isnt even any water Huh Then what about that tea earlier Shall I tell you the secret, Gin It seems like theres a high price to pay for it, so Ill pass Thats unfortunate"
" Orihime has been abducted by the Arrancars In order to save her, Ichigo, Ishida, and Sado have marched into Hueco Mundo, the world of the Hollows The first place that Ichigo and his friends came to upon exiting the Garganta was Underground Path 22, a place for intercepting intruders They crush the Arrancars standing in their way and set off for Aizens palace, Las Noches Is that Las Noches Its huge… Its hard to tell how far away we are from it Lets run… If we wait around, we might get into another fight A human! Could it be that there are other humans aside from us! Brother! Huh No! It hurts! It hurts! The tip! The tip is poking me! Stop! Stop that! What did we do to you! Stop picking on us! A mask! Youre…a Hollow! Were really sorry! We never thought that our game of eternal pursuit would cause such a misunderstanding Game of eternal pursuit Unfortunately, Hueco Mundo doesnt have any entertainment A game You were crying a little Yes! Nel is a real masochist Its no fun unless Nel is chased to the point where Nel cries a little! What kind of words are you teaching this kid! Is “Nel” your name Yes! Nel is an Arrancar named Nel Tu An Arrancar! Yes! By the way, this here is… Nels older brother, Pesche And his older brother, Dondochakka! Huh And the big thing behind us is our pet Bawabawa! Wait, wait, wait, wait! What is it Arrancars have siblings and pets! How rude! Of course they do! I ran into her by chance and she was so cute that I became her brother Oh, same here! Thats not what you would call siblings Then… Then what are we! Were not siblings! No way! No, thats fine… I was wrong… You guys can be siblings But still… Are you guys really Arrancars What are you saying! Cant you see this splendidly cracked mask! Its just that… You seem different from the guys that came to the World of the Living Oh! Of course! The ones who went to the World of the Living are Numeros! Nume…what Numeros are those who are greater than Menos Grande and have become Arrancars! They go by two digit numbers and are allowed to directly serve the Espada! Thats great, isnt it Im jealous The Numeros are the fighting experts! Theyre completely different than trash pests like us! Trash pests That aside, you look even less like an Arrancar! You dont have any mask and you wear a black kimono Its as if youre a S… Youre like a Soul Reaper Youre like a Soul Reaper U-Umm… What is it What’s…umm…your occupation Ichigo Kurosaki, Substitute Soul Reaper! Quincy, Uryu Ishida Yasutora Sado… Im human A Soul Reaper! A Quincy! A human! Put all three of them together and they’re… – Bad guys! – Bad guys! You didnt know who we were Thats because you didnt say who you were! They really are bad guys! So they were bad guys! Oh no! Nel is sure that… Nel is sure that… – Theyre going to kill us! – Yeah… Yeah… No… Were not going to kill you Honestly This is throwing me off Arrancars like this exist, huh What should we do! Hmm… Were in trouble! Nel thinks we really should exterminate the bad guys! But I dont think we can win at all! But Soul Reapers are still bad guys! Thats right! Lets invite them to a game of eternal pursuit Well pretend were playing and defeat them! Thats a good idea! We might be able to beat them! What Oh Mr Soul Reaper… If you arent bad guys, then play with us! Huh! Here we go! Wha—! Come on! Its a game of eternal pursuit! Hey, you! Catch Nel! Then beat Nel up and make Nel cry! Why you… Lets go! Wait! Why! This is a game of eternal pursuit! Were going to teach you a lesson! Kurosaki sure got his zanpakuto stolen easily Wait! Did he want to play a game of eternal pursuit Why us, too! Thats what I want to know Weve got new players! Ah! This is the essence of eternal pursuit! The more people you have, the more fun it gets! Its as profound as rock-paper-scissors! Rock-paper-scissors doesnt exactly get more fun the more people you have! This also isnt exactly fun! Phew… That was close Hey! Can you stand Y-You saved Nel Of course… You would have been squashed under them Are you hurt anywhere N-No… I see Thats good… Weve got to hurry Later! A-Are you trying to run away! Huh Are you trying to run away after what you did to us! Huh! Were in a hurry! We cant play with you! Thats so mean! You were just toying with Nel’s feelings! – You should have just killed Nel instead! – Whats going on In that case, Ill kill them! Somethings coming! H-H-H-H-H-H-H-He… Who is he! Its Runuganga, the Guardian of the White Sand! I was just informed only moments ago by Las Noches that we had intruders I never would have thought that those intruders were associated with trash pests like you Unforgivable… Im going to turn you all into desert sand! No… Its not like that! We actually… – Stand aside – Huh It seems we cant play around with him Lets go, monster! Getsugatensho! All right! He did it! It was so sudden! It was a sneak attack! Thats cheating! – Hes a bad guy! – Hes a bad guy! Shut up! Its fine Im saving you! Anyway, Im swinging at him head on Its not a sneak attack! Kurosaki! Hes coming! What! Wha—! You surprise attacked me and you arent remorseful Intruder… I really cant forgive you! I said it wasnt a surprise attack! Anyway, why is he back to normal! Whats with him! Of course hes back to normal! Runuganga is made of sand! Dont give me that! Hes after you too! Dont just stand around! No more talk! How impudent! Look out! How persistent! Im going to finish you off all at once! Fools… Its useless! Fools! Did you think you could defeat me with such a weak attack! Tsk! Crap! Kurosaki! A combined attack! Let’s wipe him out without a trace! All right! Getsugatensho! Ginreikojaku! El Directo! Did we do it I’m not sure H-Hes coming… An ant lion! Oh no! Nel! Hold on! Dont let go! Got that! Y-Yes! Crap! Isnt there anything we can do! It seems impossible I cant find any way to attack him Nel, doesnt he have any weaknesses! He does have one… But I cant tell that to bad guys Are you stupid! Youre going to be sucked into the sand, too! Just tell me! Water! Water! Th-Th-Thats right! Water! Water! Water in a desert, huh Where would we find that! Thats right! There isnt any! Thats why Runuganga is invincible! Thats why hes a guard! Im going to swallow you all at once with my mouth! Crap! Rukia… Renji… Reporting! The Spiritual Pressures of both Squad 6 Lieutenant, Renji Abarai, and Squad 13 member, Rukia Kuchiki, have disappeared from their barracks! Currently, our second division, the Patrol Corps, have spread their search to all of Seireitei Those two… M-More Soul Reapers! Bad guys! Rukia… Renji… You guys… Hey… Are you all right, Kurosaki Im not all right… You fool! Why did you go off to Hueco Mundo on your own! Why didnt you wait for us to come back! Thats because I didnt know if you were coming back… Wed come back! No matter what! Renji and I were planning on doing so from the beginning! Why didnt you wait for us! Why couldnt you trust us! Were your friends, right Ichigo Yeah… Youre right As long as you understand… Dont make me confirm something as silly as this ever again! That aside… Who are they Wh-Who are we How rude! Nel Tu! Dondochakka! Pesche Gatiche! United, were… – The Neldonpe Phantom Thieves! – The Great Desert Brothers! 	– The Three Super Powered Siblings 	of the Burning Sands! Youre not in unison! We talked about this before We decided we would be the Neldonpe Phantom Thieves! I told you that I would only accept The Great Desert Brothers! I want “Three Siblings” in the name! Well, you get the idea Theyre all Hollows What idea Oh! Bawabawa is crying! Its all right, Bawabawa! We havent forgotten about you! All right! Including Bawabawa… United, were… – The Neldonbape Phantom Thieves! – The Deluxe Desert Brothers! 	– The Four Fiendish 	Super Powered Siblings! Thats enough… Just be quiet Lets go, Rukia, Renji… Youre right They left Is that all right Hey… Wait a second, Itsugo! Im not Itsugo! Nel will guide you to Las Noches! Why is she staring at me Who knows Whats youre relationship with Itsugo Huh Youre pretty popular! Shut up… Come to think of it, whered you get that cloak Did you pick it up from somewhere It was given to me I was told that Hueco Mundos deserts are rough By whom My older brother D-Does that mean that Byakuya sent you guys here! Mr Urahara opened up the Garganta, but it was my captain who got us to the World of the Living My brother said that the only order he received was the one to bring us back to Soul Society I never received any orders concerning what to do with you after I brought you back Do whatever you like He said Whoa… I see… Byakuya did that, huh Hes gotten rather good-natured He also said that it must be unpleasant for Hueco Mundo to have that dingy boy wandering around That bastard! Kurosaki, dont do anything bothersome! Thats right! Dont pick on Bawabawa! If you want to pick on someone, please pick on Nel! Jeez! What is it this time! Dont I get a cloak My brother only gave me two cloaks Theres only enough for us Are you jealous He actually didnt want to give one to you, either, but he reluctantly gave you one because I was there Crap… Thats the sort of guy he is ARRANCAR ENCYCLOPEDIA The Arrancar Encyclopedia! Today, I shall discuss Arrancar transformations Of the three ranks of Menos, 	the only ones who will VASTO LORDES ADJUCHAS 	GILLIANS always become humanoid 	when they transform into Arrancars VASTO LORDES are the Vasto Lordes ADJUCHAS GILLIANS Many of the lower-ranking 	Adjuchas and Gillians cant become completely humanoid Huh Youre a proper humanoid, arent you Oh! Dont stare at Nel like that! Its embarrassing! More, more… – No… Look at Nel… – I guess there are exceptions like this"
" Orihime has been abducted  by the Arrancars In order to save her, Ichigo, Ishida, and Sado have marched into Hueco Mundo, the world of the Hollows They crush the Arrancars standing in their way and head to Aizens headquarters, Las Noches They come across odd Arrancars named Nel, Pesche, and Dondochakka, and wind up traveling with them Ichigo and his friends hurried on, but the Guardian of the White Sand, Runuganga, appeared before them and blocked their way Faced with an enemy who is not affected by physical attacks, Ichigo and his friends were in trouble But at that moment… Why did you go off to Hueco Mundo on your own! Why didnt you wait for us to come back! Thats because I didnt know if you were coming back… Wed come back! No matter what! Renji and I were planning on doing so from the beginning! Why didnt you wait for us! Why couldnt you trust us! Were your friends, right Ichigo But even though Runuganga was defeated, he appears before Ichigo and his friends once again That guys still not dead! It cant be… I smashed him into pieces I wont let you take another step towards Las Noches! Runuganga is made of sand! Its not strange for there to be more than one of him! So this is the second body Dance… Sodenoshirayuki Tsuginomai… Hakuren! What are you doing, Rukia! S-Sorry… I couldnt help myself Youre picking on him! Crap! Whats that Ow ow ow ow… Is everyone all right Yeah Somewhat… It looks like were all right Thank you, Bawabawa! Nel is falling, falling! That hurts! That’s my line! Move out of the way, evildoers! Step aside! That was close… Thanks for the save, evildoers! Yeah That was a perfect landing! Jeez… Anyway… Where are we Underground, right We fell from there, huh Whats this! Whats wrong, Ishida This is a tree! A tree Yeah… Its the same as the ones growing above ground I see… The trees above ground are the tops of these giant trees SURFACE SAND UNDERGROUND These reach the surface That aside, its incredibly wide here Yeah I cant even see where the walls are Whats wrong Th-This is the Forest of Menos The Forest of Menos What is the Forest of Menos I thought so… What do you mean, Ishida It was far away, but when we were falling, I saw a group of Menos Possibly… In this world, the Espada and Arrancars live on the surface and Gillians and lesser Hollows live underground Right Th-Thats right Which means… This place is crawling with them Nel… Do you know the way to the surface Nel only heard rumors of the Forest of Menos This is the first time Nel’s ever been here! Nel doesnt know of any way out Aw, its no good! We’re all going to die! It really is a forest of death! Yeah! Dont worry, Nel! Were going to die! Weve come here, so there must be a way out! Itsugo… Youre right… As long as there are Hollows here, there must be a way in and out Evildoers, thats a pretty clever thing to say! Im impressed! It doesnt please me to be praised by you All right! Now that its decided, lets move on! Hey, Ichigo! Rukias not here! Huh! When did she disappear! Probably when we were swallowed up in the sand! Where am I Ichigo! Crap!

What is it Kurosaki Rukias incredibly light, isnt she So… – Do you suppose she was blown far away – Oh no! Thats it, Ichigo! Thats got to be it! Thats why we couldnt find her when we searched nearby! Just what do you think Kuchiki is Wh-What! Whats going on! Oh yeah Ichigo, Bawabawa says that hes going to climb a tree and look for her! Ah, Bawabawa! What a good boy… All right, go! And take a good look! Look for that vile Soul Reaper with your sharp eyes! Thats a good idea! Hey… Hes calling her vile… He doesnt have eyes, either… Stop commenting on everything… Theres no end to it Wait! I want to see what this underground area looks like as a whole Let me get on! Im going, too – Give it your best, Bawabawa! – Give it your best! Im surprised that they can keep this up Thank you for saving me, but could you let go of me already! Let go of me! I told you to let go of me! Are you listening to me! Sorry… What! What are you doing! Bear with me… Well arrive at my hideout shortly This man… Im going to jump The forest seems kind of noisy There are several odd Spiritual Pressures So What should we do Theyll die if we leave them alone Hey… Weve received a notice from Las Noches Oh It looks like things have gotten fun Hey… Is that a light made of Kido You really are a Soul Reaper Where are you assigned Whats your squad Did you leave your squad Hey!

You dont want to talk, huh! Hes strong… His fighting style is random, yet it has incredible strength Hey! Can you see anything No Its no good! Thats odd… When we were falling, I could have sworn that I saw a group of Menos in this direction But I dont see them anywhere now Where did the Menos go What the…! Take a look at that! – What are they making a fuss about – Renji, lets go! – All right! – Ishida, its Hollows! Chad! Ishida! Crap! – These guys… – Youre in the way! Whats this! Whats going on!

Our only option is to bravely withdraw! But Ichigo is… Listen, Nel You just have to make yourself believe that we never knew those Soul Reapers to begin with! But we already know them… Thats why I’m saying to stop knowing them! It may already be too late Nel! Ichigo! Weve been caught! Theyre going to eat us! I’m coming right… Ichigo! Whyre there so many of them! Theyre the same ones I saw earlier! Crap! Did you bring me here so that you could kill me! Thats all youve got, huh In that case… At this rate, were going to be eaten! But what would be the best way to cook us I would probably have a strong taste if I were simmered and made into a broth I should be deep fried to savor the sweetness of my flesh!

Which means… – We dont want that! – We dont want that! Oh! TOOTH Nel, have you been wearing your hood ever since we arrived Y-Yeah… Ive got it! Settle down, settle down! Do you know who our sister here is She has been transformed into an Arrancar by Lord Aizen She is Lord Nel Tu! Oh! Dont you see this wonderfully cracked mask! – Yeah! Yeah! – Yeah! Yeah!

One of my friends is being held in Las Noches There are Vasto Lordes there… You cant defeat them with average skills I know… But I must go Shes an important friend of ours Theres no need to worry, Im not alone Well all help to save her Ashido… Why did you bring me here If I talked, youd respond, ask questions, and speak I wanted to let my friends hear that The voice of a Soul Reaper, something they haven’t heard since… Whats this Its Ichigo and the others! Follow me! Where are we Thats odd… I faintly sensed your friends Spiritual Pressure earlier Yeah… Right now, there arent even any remains of their Spiritual Pressures I wiped out those remains! If I dont wipe them out, I cant ambush you, right Come out Gillians! Th-Therere so many of them! Dont panic If we defeat him, the Menos will get slower Yeah… Fire your Cero! Aim there, Gillians! Rukia! Ashido! Our plan to make them lay face down before us by showing them Nels cracked mask was a failure Our vice-shogun was no good Hey, hey, dont tell me that you dont remember this cracked mask! Thats it! Lets try again! Will that plan really work ARRANCAR ENCYCLOPEDIA The Arrancar Encyclopedia! Today, I shall discuss the Forest of Menos The Gillians who live under Hueco Mundo can be tamed and made to follow orders Hollows, follow my orders! Oh yeah! The only ones who can order them around are Captain Aizen and the guys in charge of the forest What! You should have told me that earlier! Im going to kick you! Also, if you attack a Hollow, his friends will come, so be careful You should have told me that earlier!"

More to the point, youre alive! Your deceased friends will forgive you if you leave this place I decide my own path Lets go on! Yeah… This is Nel and the others Spiritual Pressures! Youre sure theyre here, right What should we do Its obvious! We barge in and swipe them! We cant waste time here forever! Weve got to start looking for Rukia as soon as possible! Wait!

Amusing place Thats right Whats this Spiritual Pressure! Lets hurry! Where to The exit! Whoa! Where do you think youre going, Ashido Itsugo! – Ichigo! – Did they do it! What! Where did they go! Ichigo! Bastards! Nice, Ishida! Yeah… Did you see our team play! You shouldnt talk! Dejected… We dont have to hold back now! Lets go!

Stand back Ive fought him many times Las Noches placed him in charge of this forest Unlike the others, he cant be underestimated But… Ill settle this!

I never thought that Id live to see the gleaming moonlight ever again! Furthermore, were almost at Las Noches! – We did it! We did it! – We did it! We did it! Ashido said that the Adjuchas powers changed recently I couldnt tell him, that fellow Soul Reapers joined the Hollows and are trying to change the world with the Hogyoku Ashido had been fighting for several hundreds of years under here as a Soul Reaper I couldnt tell him… Rukia… Along with saving Inoue, lets steal the Hogyoku from Aizen! Hey! Were leaving! Yeah Rukia… Yeah… Lets go Ashido, Ill come back for you Until then… It unexpectedly suits you When did you get here! Just now… Dont make a fuss about everything Its annoying Ive come to inform you Your friends have entered Hueco Mundo Why This wall… Whats the deal with it It doesnt seem to be made of Sekkiseki If its not Sekkiseki, then we can break through by force! Lets go, Renji! Dont boss me around, idiot! “Why,” you ask Theyve come to save you Aside from that… They have no other reasons Umm… What is it These clothes fit me perfectly I was wondering how you knew my size Everything is as Lord Aizen has intended it to be What! He knew just by looking at me! Thats amazing! Inoue, thats not what youre supposed to be surprised about Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! Hisagi, what should we do if our Zanpakuto breaks Did yours break This is just theoretical I could fix it for a fee C-Captain Kurotsuchi!

" Ichigo and his friends have set out for Aizens headquarters, Las Noches But they are dragged into the Forest of Menos by Runuganga, the Guardian of the White Sand In the forest, Rukia is separated from Ichigo and his friends She is saved by Ashido, a mysterious Soul Reaper Long ago, Ashido followed Hollows into the Forest of Menos He fought Hollows by himself for many years Save yourfriend! Ashido! Ichigo and his friends are able to make it back to the surface with Ashidos help, and they finally make it to Las Noches Your friends have entered Hueco Mundo Why “Why,” you ask Theyve come to save you Aside from that They have no other reasons They came to save me Thats right But that no longer has any meaning for you By wearing that, it means you are one of us in body and soul That’s the reality, Orihime Inoue Yes Tell me Who does your body and soul belong to Yes Lord Aizen and his desires Did we break through it It looks like it… Wind is passing through Wh-What are you doing! The entrance is just a three-day walk in that direction! Idiot… This isnt a friends house We cant go in through the front We dont have the time to walk for three days either Nel Thank you for bringing us this far But if you involve yourselves with us any more, youll wind up being treated as traitors So this is farewell Later! W-Wait, Ichigo! Ichigo! Ichigo! We were traitors from the moment that Lord Runuganga saw us together! No… It may have been far before then Lord Aizen may have already known! Lord Aizen will never forgive us for that! Even if Lord Aizen forgives us, the Espada wont! Nel is not saying that Nel wants you to take us with you! Nel is just telling you this so you dont get worried about us! What is she saying I think she wants him to be worried about her Nel is not saying that Nel wants you to take us with you! Nel’s not saying that! Nel’s not saying that! – Nel’s not saying that! – Aww… Jeez All right… What Her voice is getting fainter It seems that she fell underground Fell What do you mean! Oh! Wait, Ichigo! Nel! Ow ow… That hurts! That hurts! That’s my line! What are you fools doing! Oh yeah! Wheres Nel We just came here after Nel Yeah Huh Then where is she Ichigo! Look! What is this The floor fell through No… Its probably some airshaft or something that was in the walls It looks like she fell through here She sure is a lot of trouble Hueco Mundo sure has a lot of holes Nel! Are you all right! What should we do What should we do Well, we cant leave her alone Jeez What troublesome guys! Good grief… Lets go! Ichigo, you idiot! Baldy! Piece of crap! Good-for-nothing! Whos a good-for-nothing! Wh-Why did you come! Nel doesnt really want you to take me with you Aw… Im getting kind of annoyed… Ill really leave you! You pretended to come and save Nel, but you just came to pick on Nel! All right! I get it Dont cry! Ill take you with me, so give me a break! Good Ichigo! Ichigo! You ended up crying again What are they doing Theyre doing a stand-up routine Whats that I hear it coming from above us! Yeah Yeah Everyone, jump! Here… Blow your nose and wipe away your tears Kurosaki, run! Hey, guys… Ah! Nel, youre safe! Yeah Let me play too! Get off me! You did it to me yet again Whoa That was close That was close Ichigo, are you all right! You guys… Anyway, lets get out of here Yeah… Lets see if there are other stairs Hey, you guys! Hey! It sure is dark here For times like this, just leave it to me! What is it Can you do something about it When tweaked a bit, kido can be used like this! Shakkaho! Oh Thats a pretty small light I didnt think that you were so reserved Fool! This happened because he tried to look cool by using an Eishohaki even though hes not good at it Well, dont worry about it We can follow the brightness of your red hair! Theres even a song about it A reindeer with a bright red nose becomes useful to Santa… Shut up! Whats with this place Say… Did this place exist before Aizen came Hmm… Lord Aizen built the building above, but I dont know about the basement This area was probably the old building Its probably not used now Well… I dont care either way Lets go upstairs as soon as possible! Something just shined! Huh I didnt see anything – Im going to go check! – All right! Oh! Hey, wait! Whats this What is it This has got to be the exit! Indeed… The materials used to make it are different Everything from this point on must be the newly constructed building In other words, its not abandoned like this area is Its being used now We should be cautious from this point on – We dont know what-- – Ishida! Move aside for a moment! Ah! There are stairs! Another door Kurosaki, you should be a little more-- We just have to smash through and move on! We finally came to a decent-looking place! A crossroad, huh What a troublesome place to come to Nel… Sorry… It looks like well have to part ways here after all Huh It doesnt seem like you guys will be able to withstand the Spiritual Pressure from this point on! I cant even imagine what might happen from here on There are five paths Weve got to check each one, starting from the ones on the ends! No… Lets go down separate paths at the same time What are you saying! Were talking about Espada! It would be better if we move together! If we become separated… Stop Its insulting for a warrior to be concerned about his life while in the battlefield Ichigo… You say that because you are worried about me, but it is not like you to say something like that I told you that you dont need to worry about me I didnt come here so you would be worried about me! All right… Lets go down separate paths All right! Then, before we leave, lets chant a charm! A charm Yeah… Its a traditional Thirteen Court Guard Squads ritual of sorts that’s done before big battles Its fallen out of use There arent many squads that do it now But I figure its something to do at times like this Come on! Place your hands together! Dont look so unenthusiastic! I dont really want to do it either! Were going into battle now! Believethat our blades cannot be broken! Believethat our hearts will not yield! Even if we lose our way, our iron will is one! Vowthat even if the earth splits, we will come back to this place alive! They left… What should we do Hmm… If we turn back now, itll still be dangerous Oh! Where are you going, Nel Ichigo… Nel is going after Ichigo! Going after him Nel had… Nel had fun! Nel had lots and lots of fun! Nel still… Nel still want to stay with Ichigo and the others! – Nel! – What All right! Were… We’re going too! Which way did Nel go Lord Aizen and his desires She only hesitated for an instant She didnt flinch at my question Shes a tough woman Hey… How is our pet doing Nnoitora… I know that Lord Aizen has left you in charge of that woman How wonderful… So How far have you disciplined her How vulgar Dont get too crabby… Im just asking you if things are going well Come on Youre curious Thats such a trifling matter Huh Dont worry… That woman was under Lord Aizen’s spell before she came to Hueco Mundo His Kyokasuigetsu, huh Of course not Theres no need for him to use it for something like this He placed her in several psychological cages when he brought her here He ordered her to surrender and made her unable to refuse by using her friends lives Afterwards, he gave her a 12-hour reprieve and allowed her to say good-bye to one of her friends on the condition that no one else could notice her You call that a cage By giving her a reprieve, and allowing her to say good-bye to a friend in such a tense situation, shell mistakenly believe that weve shown her sympathy and her feelings will waver a little But her friends lives were not actually at risk during that 12-hour reprieve Furthermore, even though she was forced to surrender… By allowing her to choose someone to say good-bye to, shed get the idea that she had done so by choice Afterwards, by making her come to a specified place before taking her to Hueco Mundo that idea would be etched even deeper into her mind Shed gradually lose the will to run away Furthermore… The fact that we allowed her to say good-bye to only one person without anyone else noticing means that shed leave evidence of having said good-bye to only one person What of it Weve failed if you let her do that Quite the opposite… The evidence of having said good-bye becomes undeniable proof that she was free to do what she wanted until she surrendered In other words… The stronger the evidence, the more her friends would think that she willfully betrayed them That last part wasnt a complete success But its safe to say that Soul Society isnt getting involved That sure was well thought out I guess thats to be expected of Lord Aizen Well thought out This is a game to Lord Aizen It would have been fine whether she played into it or not Whatever the case… Right now, that woman has no strength to run away from here She doesnt have the will or strength to defy us either Im glad youve come… Orihime Im sorry I called you here on such short notice Theres something I want to show you Loly, Menoly, leave us Huh B-But we cannot leave someone like her alone with you – E-Excuse us! – E-Excuse us! Whats with that woman! Now then… Could you take a look at this, Orihime What is this sensation Could this be It seems you can tell… This is the Hogyoku Its a little weak from repetitive instantaneous awakenings, but its definitely becoming fully awake Without the Hogyoku, it is impossible to either transform Hollows into Arrancars, or create the Ouken Consider the fact that I showed this to you as proof that I trust you You have the power of phenomenon rejection You can negate things that have happened and wipe out the events entirely Its an incredible power I need your power… Orihime Youll use your power for me, wont you I dont think he showed me the Hogyoku because he trusts me But I at least know where the Hogyoku is And about my power… I can negate things that have happened and wipe out the events entirely Thank you for coming to save me Kurosaki But I know what I have to do here Its probably something that only I can do I have to use my power to return the Hogyoku back to the state it was in before it existed! Renji, have you ever done that cheer before No Ive suggested it to my captain several times, but for some reason he always ignores me Rukia, ask him to do it for me Well… Do you think that Byakuya would do that THE ARRANCAR ENCYCLOPEDIA The Arrancar Encyclopedia Today I shall reveal my secrets! First, my Dondochakka Eyes! Theyre sharp eyes that can find my targets in games of eternal pursuit! My Dondochakka Innards! I have a wonderful stomach that can digest anything Shoot im dead, Shinso!

Oh well… This time, Ill get serious! Whats this Youre spying on them Thats not a very good hobby, Mr Tosen How unexpected… You also came here because you were curious about their actions, too Didnt you, Ichimaru Come on… It was a joke Dont give me such a scary look Tosen, do something about him Wonderweiss! That troublesome kid has taken quite a liking to you Those who are pure are drawn together I still cant figure out exactly in what regard hes pure, though I see… No wonder he isnt friendly to me Any normal person would be wary of you Anyway, look They split up Oh, youre right Theyll have a lower chance of success if they split up Do they know what level of skill they are Yeah Furthermore, theyre passing through an interesting place Oh… The Lair of the Tres Cifras Ichigo!

He got faster! Wait up! What! You didnt think that was my true power, did you Wh-Why you… Theres no need to check your footing Your reactions are slow Your defense is weak You cant even handle a change in footing I cant do this! Its as if Im fighting a baby! Eh! Your Bankai… Use it, niño I wont lie to you… In your current state, you wont be able to defeat me no matter what you do I dont want to Why The Privaron Espada arent Espada, right Thats right… Then even more so! We need to defeat all of the Espada! I cant be using my Bankai against guys who arent even Espada! That’s why Im going to defeat you without using my Bankai! I see I understand your feelings, niño Then let me tell you one thing… Dont underestimate me Whirl! Giralda! Crap! He can release his zanpakuto without even drawing it! What are you doing Take a stance Wha-- Here I go Giralda! Im still not finished You…bastard! Getsugatensho! Ichigo… Ichigo! Is that all youve got, niño! Ichigos going to die Pre…view… Hmm… I guess Wonderweiss cant do this by himself You didnt need to test him to know that THE ARRANCAR ENCYCLOPEDIA The Arrancar Encyclopedia PRIVARON ESPADA = FALLEN ESPADA The Privaron Espada are those who 	have been removed from the Espada Their number is also dropped from a single digit to a triple digit Why did I have to be removed from the Espada I told you that you were shifted out because you were too weak No Im not! Theres got to be some high-level political judgment at work! Captain Aizen probably hated you because your facial features are too intense Niños just dont understand!"

What are you doing here! Ne… Ne… “Ne”! What about “Ne” Tell me! Nel! Im looking for Nel! Then why did you come to me! I know! Youre lost! You got lost, didnt you! Where is Nel! I dont know! You really are lost! I thought it was strange! You had no reason in choosing to come to me! Nel… Nel went after Ichigo Itll be terrible if we dont hurry! Shut up! Shes safe if shes with Ichigo! Dont cry Its scary! Th-Thats not it If we…If we dont find Nel quickly… If we dont find Nel and stop her… Nel will… Nel will… Hes running away! Why are you running away! Its a reflex! Its because youre chasing after me! Your face is… How should I put this Its thoroughly terrifying! Please, stop! Im getting to the good part of the story! You stop, first! Anyway, you have to search for Nel, right! Turn back! Nel! Ichigo! Come on! Come on, come on! Come on, come on! Use your Bankai, niño! Otherwise you’ll die! Saving your spiritual power against an opponent like me… Thats about as sweet as chocolate Why dont you understand! Youre being unreasonable, niño Use your Bankai… I want to see you at full power Getsuga… tensho! Oh Ichigo! Are you all right, Ichigo! Oh I commend you on your actions just now But now you understand, right At this rate, you dont have a chance at winning Dont assume that Im not making assumptions Im merely stating the truth! Getsugatensho! Not falling for that again! Ill use it again Ill keep using it until you change your mind Its difficult for me too Or I should say its a little troublesome I want to see your Bankai But if I dont continue to hold back… Youll…die…right! This would be all for nothing if that happened! Ichigo! Ichigo, this is bad! Youre really going to die, Ichigo! Ichigo! That bebé is worried about you, too Come on, niño, use your Bankai! Wha—! Getsuga--! I told you not to underestimate me, niño! Crap! Kids who dont listen… need to be punished Cero Cero N-Nel! She stoppedmy Cero! Sh-She swallowed it! H-Hey, Nel, are you all right D-Dont be…mean to…Ichigo Nel! I dont know who you are, bebé But you are impressive I never expected you to deflect my Cero while I was in my released form But… Dont you think youre getting a little too unruly Get lost! If you want to see it that badly… Then Ill show it to you! Sorry to keep you waiting, old man This is my Bankai! I see… Ive been waiting for this, niño I-Ichigo… Sorry, Nel You got hurt because I was being stubborn over something silly I came here and decided that in order to fight on the same level as the Espada, I shouldnt use my Bankai against anyone else How silly! You think so Its important for those who want strength to restrain themselves I think its wonderful Its not a reason worth upholding just to let my friends get hurt Does that mean that youre not after strength Are you saying that you want to protect your friends and that strength is only a method to achieve that Youre very kind, niño Youre like a saint But you have a stronger form, dont you I know about your Hollowfication Weve received the records of all the battles that have happened in your World of the Living You have a technique that makes you more like a Hollow and massively increases your battle power Use it! I see! What impressive Spiritual Pressure! But… I thought I said… I want to see you at full power! Ill use… any means, niño! You bastard! Whats wrong Are you mad, niño What are you mad about If your goal is to protect your friends, then my goal is to defeat you when youre at full strength In order to do that, I will go after that bebé instead of you Thats all Dont you… have any shame! I do! I am ashamed…that I cannot fight you when youre serious! Any other shameful thing is nothing compared to that, niño! All right Nel, stand back for a moment Theres fine Its all right… I wont let the slightest bit of Spiritual Pressure get past me Ichigo… Oh Sorry, but I can only show it to you for an instant Thats more than enough I see Thats…good Wonderful! What a wonderful Spiritual Pressure! Im deeply moved by the fact that I can fight such a wonderful enemy, niño! Come on! This time… Lets trade blows at full strength, niño! Wh-What I told you… It was only an instant What a shame… I knew that once we got the Hogyoku, the former Espada would become useless I stayed with Lord Aizen even with knowledge of that fact But… What! What are you doing! Im drooling on you I can see that! Im asking you why youre drooling on me! Shut up… What are you making a fuss about, Don Panini Its Dordoni! PANINI What kind of delicious-sounding 	name is that! She says her saliva has weak healing properties Right, Nel Yes! So if Nel does this… Wh-What are you doing! Its saliva! Thats not saliva! Its vomit! If Nel squeezes Nel’s uvula, then a lot of saliva comes out! And I’m telling you it’s vomit! Anyway, a lady shouldnt talk about that kind of thing! It’s saliva… It’s vomit I lose It feels good… My body was full of power and my heart was filled with the desire to win I was confident that I could block your attack whenever you struck, and strike back at you I didnt let down my guard But… I couldnt see it Youre strong, niño Thats not true I wanted to become an Espada again The Espada are Lord Aizens faithful servants But Lord Aizen probably only thinks of the Espada as nothing more than tools to fight I know that…but… Those who have stood at the top never forget the view from there It was incredibly pleasant there I thought that if I defeated you when you were at full strength, Lord Aizen would acknowledge my strength once again And I could return to the Espada Thats why I urged you to transform into a Hollow And my feelings… still have not changed! You bastard… Why are you surprised The fact that you healed the wounds of an enemy that you dont know, means that you were prepared for a counterattack! Am I wrong Stop! You havent recovered enough to move! Wounds are made to ones spirit, niño As long as my will to fight recovers, my physical wounds mean nothing Thats why I say youre like chocolate…niño! Theres a stage show that involves whips prepared for the Quincy boy in the next episode I guess Ill watch it over a cup of tea Take that, and that, and that, and that! I dont approve of a stage show like this! Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! MISSION TO GUARD THE ROYAL SEAL AS ITS BEING TRANSFERRED This time, 	we have a joint mission!

Keep quiet about our face Weve heard more than enough… About our face Rikujokoro, huh Of your current captains, Byakuya Kuchiki is skilled in this Kido He even knows that! A double incantation Rikujokoro and Soren Sokatsui… I dont have memories of you being able to use this technique What a fool If you hit me with that attack directly, you would have at least scratched me That comes second I realized that I could reveal your true identity by canceling out your transformation ability with sunlight So This is most important to me! It proves that you are not Sir Kaien! Now that it is clear, I can kill you without remorse! Did I hear that correctly I thought I heard you say that you could defeat me if you had no remorse Thats what I said Dont underestimate me I cant use my power…in the sun That is true But I can use it as long as I have a shadow However many times I like Honestly… Im not sure if its for surveillance or whatever, but its a real bother Hueco Mundo only has darkness Creating something similar to the sun in the World of the Living is just unthinkable There are guys like me who can only use their powers in darkness You said that my power was a transformation ability, right Are you saying that its not Its not You should know What do you mean Im the only Gillian within the Espada What of it Under usual circumstances, I wouldnt have the power to join the Espada But Ive joined the Espada and Ive been given the number nine Do you know why Thats because… Out of all of the Arrancars, I am the only one who can evolve infinitely! This ability is originally from the Hollow that Kaien Shiba fought Its Metastacias spiritual body fusion! After he died and returned to Hueco Mundo I gained his power by devouring Metastacias spiritual body! You devoured him Thats right My ability is Glotoneria I devour dead Hollows and make their abilities and Spiritual Pressure my own! This is the power I received when I devoured Metastacia when he came back in Kaien Shibas body! Th-Then… Thats right! That nostalgic feeling you had was no mistake! This body is Kaien Shibas! In his body, all of his experiences In his brain, all of his memories Theyre all there! I just read his memories and experiences and acted accordingly! Its over Ill show you an Espadas sword release Devour! Glotoneria! Riding on someones shoulders is fast, high and fun! Ichigo is a master at letting people ride on his shoulders Im so jealous I want to ride on someones shoulders, too! Why are you saying that to me! Renji… Dont come near me! They look like theyre having so much fun! THE ARRANCAR ENCYCLOPEDIA Today I will talk about the creatures in Hueco Mundo Small Hollows also live here They live by consuming the reishi in Hueco Mundos air and absorbing nutrients Who are you Are you a creature that eats similar things You cant speak I dont understand what youre saying This is problematic Dont eat everything!"
" Aizen has abducted Orihime In order to save her, Ichigo, Ishida, Sado, Rukia, and Renji have marched into Hueco Mundo They crush the enemies standing in their way and finally make their way to Las Noches Upon breaking into the palace, the group decides to split up and go down separate paths They begin fierce battles with powerful Arrancars who are waiting for them deep within Las Noches Whirl! Giralda! This time… Lets trade blows at full strength, niño! All right That wasnt even good enough to be a warm-up exercise Hado 73: Soren Sokatsui! What a fool If you hit me with that attack directly, you would have at least scratched me This is most important to me! It proves that you are not Sir Kaien! Now that it is clear, I can kill you without remorse! Its over Ill show you an Espadas sword release Devour! Glotoneria! Oh no Look, look! Curve, curve! Whats wrong Are you giving up already! Damn! Thats not a shield Dont be reckless! Damn D-D-D-Danger! Im in danger! Not only am I in danger because I followed the weakest of the bunch… PESCHES STRONG-LOOKING FACES RANKING Hes also fighting someone really strong What should I do He looks like hes going to die Maybe I should save him No, wait Think hard about this, Pesche Gatiche! Even if I were to go out, what could I do No…but… I cant continue to watch this happen! I can almost…see her underwear How does that feel Does it hurt, white four eyes It looks like you dont even have the strength to respond In that case, hurry up and… J-Just a little more… Just a little more… Who the hell are you! Youre Pesche Gatiche, right Impossible… I only said my name once, but hes remembered my full name! A-And youre Uryu Ishida Thats right A smile! C-Could it be that this man… Do you love me Why! What are you saying! Thats disgusting! Shut up! Who is that termite-like guy Is he a termite Wha—! A-A termite How rude! Call me a stag beetle at the very least! Thats not much of a difference Theres a big difference! Stag beetles are black, shiny, and cool! But youre white I dont want you of all people telling me that! Youre completely in white! Its fine if Im in white! I have pride in my whites! Pride in your whites! You talk as if youre a detergent Are you making fun of me I told you to shut up! Oh no! It seems that termite is a friend of yours W-Wait! Hes a Hollow! Hes not my friend! H-How cruel! I thought that we were friends! You idiot! So he says! You even remembered my name! Are you stupid! I said I wasnt your friend so that shed divert her attacks away from you! What! I appreciate your thoughtfulness! Ive failed though! Anyway, why are you here! Kurosaki told you to go home! Oh, that! Youve noticed something important, Uryu! Youre suddenly chummy Actually, Im looking for Nel! Nel followed after you guys screaming for Ichigo Where has Nel gone! Who is Ichigo! I have no clues Oh! Could it be that youre actually Ichigo Im Uryu! You just said that I was Uryu! Ichigo is the pointy-haired Soul Reaper! Pointy-hair… There were two Which one was he The orange one! Dont you remember anything! What are you blabbing on about! Crap! She caught up with us because I was dealing with your silliness! Bump! Leave this to me, Uryu! Leave it to you Theres nothing you can do to her! Its all right! I have a special ability! A special ability I can create a liquid that makes anything it touches incredibly slippery! Youre worthless! Aww, youre so annoying! Stop! Its useless! Be quiet and watch! Get out of the way! Pesche Gatiche! Wha—! Phew… Did you see that! Your attacks are nothing! Also, I dont really want to see your underwear! You peeked, didnt you! W-Wait! I didnt see it yet I couldnt really see it Thats why I dont really want to see it! Wh-Why are you looking at me like that, too! I wasnt peeping! Oh N-No! Please, Uryu, I want you to believe me at least! Why! You two! Quit making fun of me! I-It seems like you havent learned from my super attack! As if I would! Huh! Huh! Huh! Uryu, you saved me I thank you Theres no need to thank me Please, dont be rash! A-All right… But you saved me! I must repay you for your kindness! I will defeat her! You dont seem to understand at all Oh, are you going to fight me Of course! If I dont, then who will! Youre probably just going to create that strange liquid again Here I go! Youre pretty predictable! That won’t hit me! Are you stupid Hey… All right! I can produce a limitless amount of this liquid! You made a mistake when you underestimated me! I feel sorry for her I call this liquid “Infinite Slick”! Its annoying that its name is kind of cool Come on! Dont laugh You run away now! – What! – Dont ask why! Something like that will only be successful once Rip… Golondrina! From the way youre fighting, you dont seem to be taking me very seriously Youre the first enemy Ive encountered in a while, so I was going to take my time with you Wha— I, Arrancar Number 105 Cirucci Sanderwicci, am going to crush you! Now then… Who should I slice first Now then… Who should I slice first You run really fast, dont you, four eyes! Wait! Wait! Come on Im not finished yet! Im not going to be stopped here! Then I will fight with you! Hey, dont ignore me! Its embarrassing! Enough! Im going to turn you into paper-thin chips! Stop running around! She sure enjoys doing evil things! Youre one to talk! That’s the sort of comeback I was hoping for! Hey! Youre not getting away, four eyes! She knocked it away! Its as I thought All those feathers are vibrating at high speeds! That turbulent sound thats been reverberating is proof of that! That wont work! Huh Where did you go, four eyes I told you that doesnt work! Hey, Uryu! What have you been doing! Youre still here! I thought I told you to run away! Uryu, could it be that you used a useless attack in order to protect me! Dont call it useless! Just run away! Dont interfere! Wait, Cirucci, or whatever your name is! Theres a saying, “If you run after two hares, you will catch neither” In this case, you should give up on him and go after me! Y-You idiot! Then, I wont hesitate Wh-What! So suddenly! Wh-Wh-Wh-What are you doing, Uryu! I was trying to protect you! I want you to get out of the way! You dont need to worry about me! No, I refuse! Im going to fight with you! And I’m saying Im going to slice up the both of you together! Ive got to do something about those feathers! Uryu, what should we do! I know! Pesche! Use your Infinite Slick once more! Infini… What is that! Infinite Slick! Your weird liquid! You named it! Weird liquid How rude! I want you to call it “Infinite Slick”! Just make some already! How bothersome! You sure are hopeless! You cant do anything without me! Take a look It seems…Ive run out of it Why! Didnt you call it Infinite Slick because you could create limitless amounts of it! Well, umm… You were lying! Well… Not really a lie I was giving the impression that I could create limitless amounts of it You were lying! Yes… It was a lie Sorry Why did you lie! Well…I thought it sounded cooler that way Dont give me that! But… There are moods to situations This is a battle! There are no moods! Oh! What are you doing! Damn it! Its annoying being with you! Im the one whos annoyed! Die! Did you feel it connect Ah… I know that Its called a Flash Step, isnt it Too bad… Mine is called a Hirenkyaku Hmm… Hirenkyaku, huh How exactly are they different! A Flash Step again It looks like you can run away quickly But how long do you think you can you keep running away Its as she says… Uryu cant attack as long as hes carrying me Im being a burden Thats good enough, Uryu! Use me as a shield and create an opening! Leave my corpse behind! Ride on! Why are you crying Youre really stupid, arent you Sh-Shut up I was just imagining the climax – Pesche… – Yes This may hurt a bit, but endure it Huh! C-Could it be! Are you really going to leave my corpse behind and live! Oh Oh! Right in my crotch! Sorry, Pesche But now… I can focus on this battle! Stop blabbing on! I see… The blades continue to vibrate at high speeds even after theyre separated from her body She can also reload at ease As long as she has those blade feathers, I have nowhere to attack up close But those feathers deflect my long-range attacks before they can hit Here! One more! I have no choice Wha— What…is that How unfortunate I was really hoping to hold off on using this until a little later Shall we continue Prepare yourself, Cirucci! Were going to use our united attack of friendship, the Infinite Pesche Quincy! Ill repel that attack with my feathers! Sorry to put a damper on things, but hes not your opponent And that attack doesnt exist THE ARRANCAR ENCYCLOPEDIA The Arrancar Encyclopedia – The Arrancar Encyclopedia Today, I shall talk about a slightly odd Arrancar Aaroniero is the only Gillian in the Espada Thats because he has his Glotoneria ability, which allows him to gain the abilities and Spiritual Pressure of a dead Hollow by devouring it We can evolve infinitely No one is a match for us Hmm So which is Aaro and which is Niero Im Aaro And Im Niero – Hey, Aaroniero is not a group name! – Hey, Aaroniero is not a group name!"
" Aizen has abducted Orihime In order to save her, Ichigo, Ishida, Sado, Rukia, and Renji have marched into Hueco Mundo They finally reach Las Noches Upon breaking into the palace, the group decides to split up and go down separate paths in order to look for Orihime Each of them encountered powerful Arrancars who were waiting, and a fierce battle began Ishida fights Arrancar Number 105, Cirucci Sanderwicci, whose ever-changing whip puts Ishida into a predicament But Ishida is unexpectedly saved by Pesche, who was lost after looking for Nel Angered, Cirucci releases her zanpakuto and attacks Rip… Golondrina! Who should I slice first Youre not getting away, four eyes! She knocked it away! Its as I thought All those feathers are vibrating at high speeds! That turbulent sound thats been reverberating is proof of that! Here! One more! I have no choice Wha—! What…is that How unfortunate I was really hoping to hold off on using this until a little later Shall we continue Im glad that I took precautions When I left the hospital with Mr Urahara… I figured it would be of some use, so I borrowed it from the hidden storehouse in the hospital using Mr Urahara’s ability Seeleschneider… The only bladed Quincy weapon You “borrowed” it from a hidden storehouse without permission! Y-You thief! Shut up! I never said that I took it without permission! Then did you take it with, or without permission! Without! See, you took it without permission, you thief! Whose side are you on! Just be quiet already! What! How can you talk like that to the person who saved your life! Youre pathetic, Ichigo! Im Uryu! What! What is it this time! Youre Uryu! Thats right! Then whos Ishida I told you! It’s Uryu Ishida! Ah… Which means that youre not Ishida Uryu! Enough already! Quincy… Wha— I see… So youre a Quincy, eh You know about them I feel honored I know about them Theyre that poor tribe that was wiped out by the Soul Reapers, arent they But thats all I know! Thats right! So why is someone like you helping a Soul Reaper! I just dont understand! I dont need to answer you Why dont you pay more attention to your feathers instead of me Did you forget about earlier That wasnt a fluke or a temporary rise in Spiritual Pressure A long flight record… Will you stay quiet already! Humph! Honestly Youre so ungrateful! High-speed vibrations are destroyed by even greater high-speed vibrations Seeleschneider works like a chainsaw Reishi oscillates at three million revolutions per second along its Reishi blade Quincies are highly perceptive From what I can see, the reishi on the surface of your feathers oscillate at about 11 to 13 million revolutions per second Thats less than half of Seeleschneider’s So… In short, my feathers dont work against you anymore, right Yeah Thats right Okay I didnt think that you could freely remove your released form like that Is it the same for all of you We cant freely do this I discarded it What I cant go back to that form again The formal name for our zanpakuto releases is Resurrección, or “Returning Blade” Its something that brings back our original Hollow attack abilities to our Arrancar bodies We can only return to human form again when we return our abilities back into sword form Changing our forms without returning our powers back into sword form is the same as burning off our own arm I’m bad at conserving energy I expend a lot of Spiritual Pressure just by wearing these arms and feathers So if I cant use them, I may as well discard them And its much more useful… To gather that excess Spiritual Pressure Is this battle something you really need to go that far to win Huh! Are you stupid! If we didnt have to win, then we wouldnt have started a war in the first place! Arrancars are soldiers The Espada are their leaders We were born to kill and defeat our enemies Forgivable defeats There is no such thing! Not anywhere! I should have done this sooner! Take this! There! Tsk! Come to think of it, theres no need to fight in a form that leaves me vulnerable to hits from your sword! If we have swords with the same abilities, then the one with the longer reach will win What is it Have you given up The same ability You seem to be getting slightly the wrong idea Seeleschneiders Spiritual Pressure vibrations arent for cutting It uses vibrations to loosen the bonds between the reishi of the object it cuts to make it easier to take its reishi A Quincy battle is about gathering the reishi from the surrounding area and fighting with it as a weapon Seeleschneider is the strongest embodiment of that idea Your reishi is pretty much mine Y-Youve got to be kidding! Also, youve got another thing wrong Seeleschneider is not a sword Quincies dont use any weapon other than bows Sorry… I win… Cirucci Sanderwicci Indeed, one’s reach was the winning factor Lets go, Pesche Is that all right Shes not dead The choice of whether someone lives is in the hands of the victor I am the victor of this battle I pierced her soul chain, the source of spiritual power production Arrancars are Hollows who have become more like Soul Reapers… Their soul structure should be similar Letting her live may be an insult to her, but I have no intention of stooping to their standards Even if she awakens and comes after me, she wont have enough power to fight me I see… If thats the case, thats fine Come on, lets go, Ichigo! Im Uryu Damn it Thats quite a slight Lord Cirucci Sanderwicci… Ive come for you Please be quiet Damn it How trifling Youre just no match for me, Arrancar Number 107, Gantenbainne Mosqueda Its useless A human who cant even use a Sonido will never be able to get his attack to hit me! I keep on telling you that Right, Yasutora Sado If you still want to fight, I wont stop you But youll die Try and see if Ill die You only use the force of strength But attacks like this are useful too, you know I’ll say it to you once more… Youll really die Right now, I have no intention of dying Jeez Youve got some guts What! I told you that I have no intention of dying Yasutora Sado, I understand your feelings I suppose Ive got to fight you at full strength Thats right… I have to get past you Sounds pretty interesting Im not finished yet! You fool! Uno! Dos! Cientos! Stand, Yasutora Sado I know that youre still hiding your power Youre strong… Guys like you shouldnt fight like this Swear, in the name of God… that well fight fairly No response, huh That makes me sad! Sorry I wasnt exactly hiding it Its just that ever since I came to Hueco Mundo, I sensed something about my power thats different from when I was in the World of the Living I was puzzled by that something, and I wasnt able to get a grasp of my power until now But Ive finally grasped it… I can use my full power from here on Brazo Derecho Del Gigante This is my right arms true form Ichigo and the others have Nel and her group with them… No ones come to me If youre jealous, Ill trade places with you at any time What are you saying, Ichigo! Were best friends! A best friend would never get my name wrong |THE ARRANCAR ENCYCLOPEDIA The Arrancar Encyclopedia Today we will discuss sword releases An Arrancars sword release is called a Resurrección, or Returning Blade An Arrancar does this to bring its original Hollow attack abilities to its Arrancar body What do you think Im pretty sexy even when Im released, arent I But if you fly around like this, wont we be able to see up your skirt Im armored under my skirt too, so its all right! What! Just what do you think mens fantasies are! I dont care! Im sorry "

Sorry I wasnt exactly hiding it Its just that… ever since I came to Hueco Mundo, I sensed something about my power thats different than when I was in the World of the Living I was puzzled by that something, and I wasnt able to get a grasp of my power until now But Ive finally grasped it I can use my full power from here on Brazo Derecho Del Gigante This is my right arms true form Thats nasty, Pesche Gatiche! Dont sneeze out your mucous! What are you saying! This is not mucous! Its my liquid that makes everything it touches turn slippery! Huh This is Infinite Slick Infinite… What is that You forgot again Thats the name you gave it! Ah! That’s right! Just as I expected of you, Ichigo Your observations are sharp! Im Uryu! Now, now, it doesnt matter who you are Youre so nitpicky Its not okay! Come to think of it, didnt you run out of Infinite Slick in that last battle Thats what I thought, but it seems it was stuffed up somewhere! Ah! What a waste! Do you plan on collecting it It’s not something you could reuse again Whats wrong Hmm… This is problematic Take a look This isnt Infinite Slick This really is my mucous Stop, dont come near me! Thats dirty! What are you saying, Uryu! Were friends who share the same fate! Why do you only get my name right at times like this! Wash your hands! Where How should I know! Why Wait! Uryu! This is… Sados Spiritual Pressure! But it cant be I caught you Thanks, Ichigo! I didnt notice it until now No I probably didnt want to notice it When I came to Hueco Mundo, I felt the power within me stir Its something I never felt when I entered the Soul Society That stirring continued to get stronger as I approached this place Then… When I was hit by your attack, I finally felt that stirring calm down I thought that maybe that stirring was a stir of excitement I thought that when I came to Hueco Mundo My power stirred with excitement as if it had come home, and recovered itself from the rough welcome of its comrades Theres something Ive been wondering about ever since I got this power My power isnt like that of Soul Reapers or Quincies Then what am I I finally found that answer Rather than Soul Reapers and Quincies, it seems my power is closer to that of Hollows Brazo Derecho Del Gigante This is my right arms true form And… Its true power Did you get slower Tsk! Bastard What power Not only that, but his reactions have become fast enough to keep up with my Sonído! I should be able to block this I can block this You really did get slower This guy is incredible Damn! Hes gotten faster again What should I do! I think that… In this world, there are no comparable powers Power always changes Its animalistic Small leads are always created Just like with you and me So what of it The one who broadens his lead the most wins! Thats a good theory But were still not sure whos going to win! I cant completely block it! True form… True power, eh Indeed, it’s worth boasting about But you havent forgotten, have you I have my own true form Isnt that right, Dragra! Dios, ruego nos perdone Dios, ruego nos perdone Sorry Gantenbainne There is one thing I didnt tell you This arm is indeed my right arms true form And Abuelos spirit indeed dwells in this arm Abuelo taught me how to use power to protect others You must learn what your big, strong fists are for Yes I just didnt understand Ever since I gained my power, the power that dwelled in my right arm was the power to protect others And during my training, I finally found the power within me to attack This is it Its name is Diablo… Brazo Izquierdo Del Diablo Diablo… The devil Diablos a pretty exaggerated name! Isnt it, Yasutora Sado! Why you… Not bad In battle, I always fight at full strength I know no other way to fight Is that so Then I guess Ill go at full strength, too La Muerte I was able to grasp my power because you fought me at full strength, Gantenbainne Thank you Thanks to you, I can fight on Ill leave you alive I wish you luck Anyway… Whats the meaning of this Isnt this place within those walls There was supposed to be a giant domed roof within these walls Why is there no roof Also, outside of these walls it was forever night The moon didnt even move from its position Why is it suddenly daytime!

" Aizen has abducted Orihime In order to save her, Ichigo and his friends have marched into Hueco Mundo They break into Las Noches, the Arrancars’ hideout During his battle with Gantenbainne, Sado awakens the power that had been resting within him But Nnoitora, one of the Espada, suddenly appears Sado is powerless before him Tsk! Look at that You really are weak Chad was defeated! Thats impossible! Believe in him! We vowed that wed come back alive! If I were you, Id be angry that they were foolish enough to come to Hueco Mundo without knowing the limits of their strength Meanwhile, Rukia is fighting Aaroniero She too, was facing danger My ability is Glotoneria I devour dead Hollows and make their abilities and Spiritual Pressure my own! This is the power I received when I devoured Metastacia when he came back in Kaien Shibas body! This body is Kaien Shibas! In his body, all of his experiences… In his brain, all of his memories… Theyre all there! I just read his memories and experiences and acted accordingly! Its over Ill show you an Espadas sword release Devour! Glotoneria! Thats a nice expression Youre scared, arent you Become even more terrified! This is the power of all the Hollows I have devoured! Dont expect an Espadas sword release to be like that of a regular Arrancar! My Glotoneria can display all the powers of the Hollows I have eaten at the same time! So far, Ive eaten 33,650 Hollows! This will be just like fighting an army of more than 30,000 Hollows by yourself! Sir Kaien… Sir Kaien… Im very sorry It seems this is the end for me Your body has fallen into the hands of a Hollow because I killed you I killed you back then in order to save myself But even so… Sorry about that, it must have been harsh Thanks to you… I can leave my heart here I got Sir Kaiens body back from the enemy Thats the one thing that I told myself had saved him But it seems even that was also a mistake I dont have the strength left to swing my sword anymore I dont have any strength left to swing my sword at your body, Sir Kaien Goodbye Sir Kaien Good…bye Kuchiki… Kuchiki… Kuchiki! Wh-What are you doing, Sir Kaien! You dont respond when I call you or nudge you! What if I had gotten a crick in my neck! A crick in your neck Were you sleep-walking! Jeez… Stop daydreaming! Were almost there! This is… Youre going to get left behind, Kuchiki! Y-Yes! Sorry! The wind hits my forehead… The forest opens out onto our path ahead… The smell of the grass… The sunshine… The birds chirping… Hey! Where are you going! I remember…this landscape Each tree… This combined feeling of anxiety, excitement, and warmth This is West Rukon District, Area 3, North end, Mt Koifushi This is the place where Sir Kaien first trained me So youre the new recruit! I’m the Lieutenant, Kaien Shiba! Nice to meet ya! Umm… Yes, sir “Umm… Yes, sir” What’s with that greeting! Your Lieutenant just introduced himself! Youre supposed to state your name and say, “Pleased to meet you too, sir,” right! What’s your name, damn it! I’m R-Rukia Kuchiki, sir Oh And P-Pleased to meet you too, sir! Good! All right, Rukia! An ordinary greeting, an ordinary yelling, an ordinary subordinate-superior relationship… I welcome you to Squad 13! Our captain isn’t in the best of health, so I’m pretty much in charge of things here! So I wouldn’t mind if you sometimes call me “Captain Kaien” by mistake! Umm, Ill think about it But that ordinariness was, without doubt, just what I was seeking Whats wrong! Were not finished yet, Kuchiki! Come on! O-One more time, please! A bird flies… Im distracted by the bird for a moment Sir Kaien deflects my sword From the bottom left as I make my second strike I remember everything Its odd because I was caught up in the moment You want to eat, huh All right… Youre extremely self-asserting I-Its not like that, Sir Kaien! That was… Dont worry about it! Whoa! Wh-Wh-Wh-Whoops! S-Sir Kaien! Dont toss a sword when its unsheathed! Its dangerous! Everyone gets hungry Dont be so embarrassed No… But… At that time, there was one thing I was worried about Brother, the entrance ceremony went smoothly What Seat are you Oh…well… My deepest apologies With my abilities, I’m afraid I couldn’t get an officer’s seat upon entry I see You may leave I never had a gift for sword-fighting Dig your claws into the wall of sinless dreams! Hado 33: Sokatsui! My kido received good grades when I was at the Soul Reaper Academy But in the Thirteen Court Guard Squads, it was average Should I really be here Where is my purpose Why am I here Huh Why am I here Thats obvious! To fight and defend! Defend what “Defend what” All sorts of things all over the place! That sounds like a rather crude answer Could you give me a slightly clearer answer A clearer answer, huh Kuchiki, have you heard our captains theory No There are two types of battles There are battles to defend lives and battles to defend peoples pride That is Captain Ukitakes theory But I think that, in the end, hes telling us to defend the same thing The same thing What would that be Our hearts What Thats so melodramatic Hey! Im being serious! Then… Let me ask you, Kuchiki Where do you think that heart exists Huh! W-Well, umm… I guess around here I think… The heart is probably here Maybe When we come into contact with each other, a heart is created between us The heart isnt within our bodies The heart is created when we think about something or someone If I were the only person in the world, I wouldnt have a heart Thats right… That’s exactly what Sir Kaien said Theres nothing to worry about If you want to be here from the bottom of your heart, then your heart is here If your heart is here, then that is your reason to be here Also… But Kuchiki… When you fight from here on, there is one thing that you mustnt do That would be… To die alone Our bodies are made of souls If we die, our bodies will someday turn to dust and become the reishi that makes up Soul Society But where do our hearts go Our hearts go to our friends They go to our friends… If they go to our friends, our hearts can live on within them So dont die alone, Kuchiki Got that, Kuchiki Kuchiki… Our hearts go to our friends Youre still conscious Wonderful No… Or perhaps I should call you unfortunate No matter how long you hold on, it doesnt change the fact that you cannot kill me You still have the strength to hold your sword I remembered What I dont know what you remembered, but what do you plan to do with a broken sword Youre an eyesore, go away! S-Sanomai… Shirafune Wha— What I remembered where my heart is Indeed, you have Sir Kaiens body within you But Sir Kaien is not in there! I am holding onto Sir Kaiens heart! Farewell, Espada! It hurts! It hurts! Help me, Lord Aizen! Lord Aizen! You told me that if I stayed with you, youd free me from all suffering! So what is this! It hurts! It hurts! It hurts! No! No! No, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, no, no, no…no… Crap! I cant agree…with…this Dont die… Dont die, Kuchiki Dont ever die alone I know loneliness The loneliness of being a prisoner I know happiness  The happiness of seeing my friends coming to save me Hey! And I know the terror of seeing a friend become injured and fall Dont worry, Inoue Im coming right now Lord Nnoitora, the other day, you stuck your finger into the ground What was that Huh Its how I inspect the Spiritual Pressure within Las Noches You can do that! All right Ill give it a try! – Lets go, Tesla – Yes Hey, dont ignore me! Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! What We dont have any more money SOUL REAPER WOMENS ASSOCIATION Yes Weve used up all of 	our funds for this quarter You all wasted our money! Madam Chairman, you used up most of our money!

" Aizen has abducted Orihime In order to save her, Ichigo and his friends They break into Las Noches, the Arrancars’ hideout, and begin fierce battles with powerful Arrancars who are waiting for them Sado defeats Gantenbainne, but Nnoitora, one of the Espada, appears immediately afterwards Sado is powerless before him Look at that You really are weak Chad was defeated! Thats impossible!  Believe in him  We vowed that wed come back alive! It seems youve noticed That idiot Nnoitora was impatient We were ordered to wait in our palaces Sado isnt dead He isnt dead Meanwhile, Rukia clashes with Aaroniero, an Arrancar who has the face of the late Squad 13 Lieutenant, Kaien Shiba At that same moment, Renji was also in a tough situation against Octava Espada, Szayelaporro Oh Of course, youre wonderful too So Ill give you the greatest welcome Id like you to accept it How about it Theres no need to be modest Wait What do you mistake this for I didnt come here to talk to you I came here to crush you guys I dont care who you are I dont want your welcome If you want to talk, then talk to me while Im slicing you But I have no intention of holding back! Bankai! Hihio Zabimaru! What See This is what happens when you dont listen to everything I have to say You cant use your Bankai in this room I can’t use my Bankai Yes, thats right Its nice that you confirmed it verbally Not bad for an idiot I have complete information on your Bankai From its form, abilities, and Spiritual Pressure, to even its reishi composition I used that information to seal away your Bankai within this palace Complete information on my Bankai Only those who have fought against it first-hand should know about that How is that possible My older brother What Do you remember my name You probably dont Oh well Ill say it once more My name is Szayelaporro Grantz Illfort Grantz is… my older brother Him Oh You remember that scum I must thank you for that From the way you talk… Youre not here to avenge your brother, are you A fool would think that Did you think I came after you for that I gained information about your Bankai from the Rokureichu, the recording spirit bugs I placed them all over his body while he was healing his wounds To me, he was just a box to carry my Rokureichu Im not childish enough to get mad at you for breaking my box Youre real scum What a completely unexpected complaint Im stunned Fine You no longer have a way to win or escape Dont struggle This is the first time Ive seen an individual who can use a Bankai in person Im actually quite excited So dont struggle I want you to die in as close to perfect condition as possible Sanomai… Shirafune Wha— Aaroniero, huh Master Halibel, what should we do! That kid Dying in such a pathetic way… Master Nnoitora… Kaboom! You woke up! Hey there, Stark! Lilinette… Give me a break Hey! Dont sleep! Come on, wake up!

The finishing blow! Just kidding Why you… Your swings are pretty slow Youre slower than my information on you Bastard… Dont you realize yet I was just making you dance on the palm of my hand You bastard… It cant be… Oh You seem to have noticed You dodged my attacks without moving much I was testing to see how good your attacks are They were below my expectations Is this the best you can do without your Bankai Dont underestimate me! Roar! Zabimaru! I don’t even have to see your swings anymore I can see your attacks That attack wont work against me anymore You bastard… Master Szayelaporro! Master Szayelaporro! Master Szayelaporro! Master Szayelaporro! Lumina and Verona Whats wrong Aaroniero died! Died! Died! Died! Hmm… Oh, its true Ive got the report I was so engrossed in what I was doing that I didnt notice it Oh They killed each other, Soul Reaper What are you talking about Im saying that one of your friends and an Espada killed each other! Congratulations! Thats quite the accomplishment! Whether they killed each other… Were still not sure, you say You should stop with the optimism Ive received the name of your dead friend Kuchiki is one of your friends names, isnt it That was the reaction I expected You really are amusing But Ive told you many times You cant damage an Espada with just your Shikai Quit your blabbing Get out of the way! Whats wrong, Ichigo Rukia! So youve noticed I thought that you were a kid who possessed only brute strength Amazingly, you have some decent senses Youre… Its been a while, Soul Reaper I sense several Spiritual Pressures nearby  Someone is fighting  And that Spiritual Pressure earlier was Kuchiki  Whats wrong, Ichigo Did you sense something happening to your friends Im Uryu Ishida Remember that, already! All right, Ichigo! So where are we headed Youre doing that on purpose, arent you Its easy to play the straight man thanks to my obvious funny man, isnt it! This is my talent! Lets keep it up Youre wasting time! Lets go! Oh! Wait! Wait! Wait! Hey, Uryu! Youre… Ulquiorra! You remember my name I dont think I ever told you my name, though Oh well Rukia Kuchiki has died What! More accurately, she and Espada Number 9 killed each other Her whole body was covered in cuts and she was stabbed by a spear She cant be alive Dont make assumptions Rukias Spiritual Pressure only decreased just now You werent even fighting her Theres no way that you would know Synchronized Awareness… That was one of Espada Number 9s abilities as well as one of his roles He can immediately convey information about the enemies he fights to his comrades Let me out! Let me out of here! Please let me out! Let me out Let me out Let me out Im coming right now I don’t want it to be like this Kuchiki… Where are you going Im going to save Rukia I thought I told you shes dead I dont believe you You sure are stubborn Is it all right for you to leave without killing me I have no reason to fight you What do you mean Youre my enemy But you havent hurt any of my friends yet I see So what if I tell you that I was the one who brought Orihime Inoue to Hueco Mundo So Inoue really didnt go to Hueco Mundo of her own free will! How unexpected You were slightly doubtful of her even though you came to save her Do you understand what you did! Because of you Inoue is being called a traitor! Probably If not, then we’ve miscalculated things You bastard! Do you have a reason to fight me now I-Ichigo… Nel, stand a little further away Ichigo… It seems that hes not going to let me past Sorry Im in a hurry Im going to go at full strength! Bankai! Soul Reaper, youre exhausted, but you seem to have recovered quite a bit Of course! I covered him with my saliva, which has excellent healing properties Ichigo cant live without me anymore Dont speak poorly of me! Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! – Golden! – Golden! Butter… – Butter… Butter… – Its “cheese,” Nemu! Butter… Run away! Capture them I dont know what youre up to, but you lost from the moment you chose me as your target FAILURE"

Glotoneria! I was just making you dance on the palm of my hand Dont underestimate me! Roar! Zabimaru!

Are you all right, Ichigo! Im all right We cant waste time here What My, my… I couldnt even stop it with two hands Im a little surprised Was that your best It seems like it was How unfortunate Nel, are you all right! Nel! Hold on! Im going to let you rest somewhere and… You took out that mask just when you blocked my Cero, didnt you Your reaction time is impressive But this time, it broke instantly You cant bring it out again Give up Whos going to give up Youre the leader of the Espada, arent you That means that if I defeat you, this battle is pretty much won! I see… Thats unfortunate Wha—! Four! Yes… Quatro Espada, Ulquiorra Shifar Of the Espada, my strength ranks… Fourth Ichigo Kurosaki… You cannot defeat me Even if you do defeat me, there are three Espada above me You can try a thousand times You will not be victorious It seems that I overestimated you Your development didnt meet my expectations This is it If you can still move in that condition, leave this place immediately If you cant move, then die there Your path ends here, Soul Reaper Kurosaki It’s a lie! Kuchiki and now Kurosaki That cant be! Ul… See The princess is by herself Orihime… Lets play That was the reaction I expected You really are amusing But Ive told you many times You cant damage an Espada with just your Shikai Quit your blabbing Get out of the way! This is also as expected How simple I got you to move Wha—! Didnt you notice Wasn’t it supposed to be as expected Who cares if you sealed away my Bankai Who cares about your data Zabimaru is my arms and legs! I say that its too early to take me lightly just because you can read my movements! The battles…just beginning! Youre not getting away! How unfortunate it must be for you to be so incompetent I told you that I received all of your data Your attack speed is, naturally, very basic information Go! I told you… You no longer have any way to win or escape What! Once you use your trump card, its no longer a trump card Lumina, gimmie! Lumina, not fair! Im tired of this What I told you, Im tired of this Dont you understand words anymore Your Zanpakuto is a power-type Theres nothing special about it The way in which it changes forms is also very simple Im well aware this is rude, but theres nothing interesting about it anymore Lets finish this Whats this! Fracciónes… We Espada are given Arrancars ranked undecimo, eleventh, and lower for direct subordinates as a testament to our right to rule Those are the Fracciónes There are Espada who have only one, and there are Espada who have a ton of them My Octava Fracciónes are a little unique Theyre Hollows that I modified and had Lord Aizen turn into Arrancars So what of it Well, lets stop with the useless chatter Anyway, youre no longer worthy enough for me to fight you directly Now then… The show’s over Bastard! L-Let go of me! All of you, dont interfere Of course, I wont interfere either At least make the epilogue exciting Umm… Hmm I see You live in a nice room Yeah… Hmm This is a really nice room Lord Aizen likes you, doesnt he It’s true isn’t it Everyone is infatuated with you Youre a star! Youre really amazing Five people came to save their princess Thats… Say, Orihime… Do you think that youre really something Humph! How lame! Or do you think that this is only natural I dont think that What Did you say something I couldnt hear you I dont think that Hey, Menoly, did you hear that She doesnt think that! How unexpected! Let me give you some good advice, Orihime Dont get cocky, you skank! Youre a human! Dont stay at Lord Aizen’s side! Huh What is that Shes really annoying! Shall we beat her up Why not Ill stop when she starts crying Thats a good idea! Orihime… Show us your ugly tearful face! Oh Ill edit your numbers so theyre better I never expected you to hold on so long This is troublesome Once hes like this, its not easy to stop him How unfortunate I may not be able to collect your body in its complete form Its unfortunate for you that this building isnt made of Sekkiseki Your Spiritual Pressure was reverberating from beyond three walls Whats wrong You look like youve taken quite a beating, Renji Abarai! Youre… Ishida! Occasionally, your Spiritual Pressure will increase momentarily How does that work, Soul Reaper Its willpower! Simple-minded people always say that What! Stop, Renji, its exactly as he says Back me up here! Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! – Golden! – Golden! Now then I guess Ill have some tea Wh-Whats this! Soi Fon… Kiyone!

Dont interfere How exciting Im going to personally take a look at what theyre going to do in that condition Wait one moment This…doesnt hurt Honestly, that Uryu… Going off by himself I cant play the fool well without a straight man Take a look at what I did just now Id like him to note that I fell on my butt because I was always like this and not just playing dumb Did I fall into the middle of everything I sense an extraordinary Spiritual Pressure Is it bad This situation is bad, isnt it Thats… Dondochakka! He went to Renji! Anyway, whats that! Are you telling me that hes in that amusing pose just because he got mixed up in this battle! Damn it! Hes not my friend anymore! Im going to cry! Still… I found him, so I should save him Please… Nobody notice me Do you hear a rustling Come to think of it, I do Its all right, Pesche! You can do this! No one will notice your existence! And I dont mean that I have no presence! – Could it be – Could it be – A cockroach – A cockroach Roach! No! I hate cockroaches! Someone your size! Its not a matter of size! They can fly!

I was wondering what you were going to do As I expected, youre only using brute force! How silly What are you doing Unfortunately, I have no interest in things like this Inferno and war, the sea barrier surges… – Head to the south! – Hey! Say something Indeed, theres a big difference in strength between you and my Shikai And I dont think I have a chance in a power struggle But… Even if the difference in our power is great, youll hurt a little if you get hit at point-blank range I was always terrible at Kido I was always scolded because I could never control it and it would explode Now then, lets see whos tougher! You or me! Hado 31: Shakkaho! Damn! How impudent of you, Soul Reaper! Its exactly as we had planned If Abarai attacks you, whether hes successful or not, youll retreat in the opposite direction from him As for your distance… You seem to like looking down on people If you get attacked, you have a habit of moving just beyond the reach of your enemy What of it You seem to like attacking people when their backs are turned Do you think youve won, Quincy Yes… I do Impossible! I thought I sealed away the Spiritual Pressures of all your weapons That just means that there are things in this world that you dont know about Shall I explain the situation in terms that are easier for you to understand Hasta aquí… Its over, Szayelaporro Grantz Damn! – Lord Szayelaporro! – Lord Szayelaporro! Wh-What was that technique just now, Uryu! Sprenger… It destroys everything within the circle I drew with the Gintô and the Seeleschneider Seeleschneider has the ability to store reishi in its hilt in the event of a battle with an enemy that can diffuse reishi I can use that reishi to temporarily revive its blade I used it to draw a Quincy Zeichen By dropping a drop of the compressed reishi thats in my Gintô I can create a giant explosion within the circle Its powerful, but difficult to use because casting it takes a long time I cant use it in one-on-one battles I need help from someone I can trust Flattery wont do you any good I really am grateful to you Damn… Wha—! B-Bastard! – Lord Szayelaporro! – Lord Szayelaporro! Lord Szayelaporro! Damn…damn…damn…damn… Im honestly surprised that you can stand after taking that Of course… I told you… I analyzed everything about your Spiritual Pressure Even an attack Ive never seen before If the Spiritual Pressure is yours… I can disperse the impact and… reduce the damage… the damage… the damage, you fools! – L-Lumina! Lumina! Lumina! – Dont make a fuss! Ill make you a new one later! Y-Yes!

" Aizen has abducted Orihime In order to save her, Ichigo and his friends have marched into Hueco Mundo They break into Las Noches, the Arrancars’ hideout, and begin fierce battles with powerful Arrancars who are waiting for them Ishida arrived to save Renji, who was in danger But Szayelaporro, who has gathered the Spiritual Pressure data on Ishida, proves to be a tough opponent Ive already analyzed all of your abilities, Quincy! Dont stand around doing nothing! You can still fight, cant you! Ishida ends up being saved by Renji, who breaks into the battle The two join together to fight Szayelaporro Even if the difference in our power is great, youll hurt a little if you get hit at point-blank range Hado 31: Shakkaho!

Where am I going Im going to change my clothes Its embarrassing to fight in these worn-out clothes, dont you think Meanwhile, Grimmjow takes Orihime to Ichigo, who is wounded from his battle with Ulquiorra An incredible Spiritual Pressure is swirling around Kurosakis wounds I cant…reject it Who did this Ulquiorra… Ill teach him the punishment for attacking someone elses prey Are you all right Whats wrong! What happened! Too close! Too close! Too close! I keep telling you that when I see your face up close, I feel like my heart is going to stop! Im worried about you Thats so mean! POW! I told you not to get close to me! Okay What an impressive stand-up routine We cant lose to them, Uryu! Come on! Its our turn next! Huh Uryu Uryu “U” for Uryu! Shut up You dont have to call for me so loudly I can hear you All right Youve done well Lets make this into a game of shiritori Huh Over there I cant seem to sense Szayelaporros Spiritual Pressure nearby Bastard… Do you suppose he really did go to change his clothes Probably Can you run, Abarai Yeah… Thats not a problem Then, next is “s” for snail! Huh Are we going to do something You two really are dumb Were getting out of here, of course! Ulquiorra… What are you doing, Grimmjow What’s wrong I’m asking you… What do you think youre doing Healing the wounds of the enemy I defeated Youre not going to answer Fine Anyway, Lord Aizen has entrusted that girl to me Hand her over I refuse What Whats wrong You’re sure talkative today, Ulquiorra! I know, Ulquiorra Youre afraid to fight me Youre afraid to fight to the death! You deflected it, huh! I expected that one shot wouldnt… Damn… Wh-What was that just now Aizen gives us Espada something called a “Caja de Negación,” which is used to punish subordinates I used that Caja de Negación Itll trap most guys in a closed dimension forever But its not something thats made to work against other Espada Taking his Spiritual Pressure into consideration, hell probably stay trapped for two to three hours Now that you know, get to healing him I dont want to Im not asking you whether you want to heal him or not! Heal him! No! If I heal Kurosaki, youre just going to hurt him, arent you I wont do it! You bastard! Let go of her – Kuro— – Inoue… Heal me Huh Heal my wounds And… His as well Stop! Ive done nothing to get your sympathy Me neither But you want to fight on equal terms, dont you Or… Are you going to use those wounds as an excuse when you lose Bring it on! Lets have a fair fight to the death! I accept your challenge! Come on Dont make that face, Nel But Ichigo… Inoue, dont you worry either Ill win for sure Ichigo… Lets move elsewhere, Grimmjow Fine Kurosaki… Let’s go! Ichigo… Ichigo… Itll be all right Kurosaki will win Y-You dont know that for sure! He said that he was going to win E-Everyone says that! And they usually lose! You dont know whos going to win! You think so Thats right! Ichigo is probably afraid! People who are afraid always say that theyre going to win! Kurosaki wouldnt say that Huh Kurosaki wouldnt say that hell win because hes afraid or because hes trying to fool himself Kurosaki is a kind person Whether he uses powerful words or not, he always says them as if hes making a vow When he first appeared to me as a Soul Reaper… If you want to kill Inoue, youll have to kill me first! And when we went to Soul Society to save Kuchiki… We just have to defeat them, right He was always like that He does that to reassure us too But if anything, I think that hes making a vow to himself I think that hes making a vow to himself and saying it aloud to make it come true So its all right When Kurosaki says that hell win, thats when hell win for sure Really So… So…lets wait for him…and believe Getsuga… This is good! Ive been waiting for this! The chance to crush you at full power! You been waiting for this too, havent you, Ichigo Kurosaki! Im not fighting you so that I can crush you Dont be soft! Say it! Say that you want to beat me to a pulp! Im the guy who slashed up your friends! You want to rip me up into pieces, dont you! Im asking which is the stronger one! This is bad! Ichigo, lets retreat for now! D-Damn it… Rukia! I wont forgive you! You have to learn why I keep this scar! Getsugatensho! Lets begin Ill put you down and show you whos stronger! Whats with that look on your face It seems like you really have no intent to kill me Youre so pathetic What Let me ask you this, Kurosaki Why did you come here Thats obvious! To save Inoue! Then why didnt I see you even attempt to run away with her when you saw her! Were you relieved that she appeared to be unharmed Youre so dim-witted You dont even know how she is on the inside Did you do something to Inoue! Thats a good expression… Kurosaki! You said that you came here to save that girl, right You dont seem to understand, so Ill tell you! Youre wrong You came here to fight You can see it The path your instincts show you Youre a Soul Reaper! Im a Hollow! The loser will be slaughtered! Thats whats been done for thousands of years now! Is there any other reason to fight! Come on! The last one standing can leave alive! Thats all! Youve got a good look to you now, Kurosaki But… Thats not good enough! Thats not the side of you I really want to fight! Take this! This is the most powerful Cero, which only Espada are allowed to use! Inoue… Wait, Grimmjow! Gran Rey Cero! Kurosaki… Ichigo… Youve finally shown yourself Thats some good Spiritual Pressure, Kurosaki! Im going, too! Grind! Before that… Whats wrong If youre going to do your release, then just do it! Shut up! Im making sure that no ones going to interfere! Youve gotten pretty cautious Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! Hisagi here Kira here Excuse us! You two, model for me for a moment! – What – What All right, pose! Thats good! Yes, just like that! How manly! Then… Just because… That too! – What! – What!

What did you say! Well, what of it! Stop it, both of you! When you raise your voice, you look weak – What the hell did you just say, Sun-Sun! – What the hell did you just say, Sun-Sun! – Why you stupid… – Why you stupid… My, how vulgar What! Turn this way! Why you… Grimmjow is getting carried away Dont be bothered by that This is a battle with an Espada in his Resurrección form Its no surprise that you would be scared Its a very basic fear Embrace it Yes But… Is the person hes fighting really human Judging by the quantity, density,  and darkness of his Spiritual Pressure, he cant be human Its as if… Im watching a battle between two Espada Ive got you, Ichigo Kurosaki! It seems youve increased the amount of time that you can maintain that masked state! Have you trained since our last battle Or have you unconsciously gotten better during your previous battles Either is fine Im glad It would be boring if your mask immediately cracked, just like in our last battle! It would be boring if my mask broke Dont make me laugh! Thats my line, Grimmjow! Youre boring So dont undo your sword release! Is that the best you can do, Ichigo Kurosaki! I-Ichigo… Kurosaki… Is that really Kurosaki Take this! Inoue! I-Ichigo! Kurosaki… Im all right This is nothing Did you go to save them Thats quite the effort Whats wrong Youre breathing heavily If you have time for idle talk, you should worry about yourself! Dont act tough You already took five hits of that It would be strange if you were still all right Your mask is at its limit too My limit Whos at their limit How persistent Thats how I want it You look like youre getting pretty worn out too Sorry But youre just imagining it! I mustnt be afraid I mustnt… …be afraid When I remember those eyes, I feel as if Kurosaki has become someone else I feel as if Kurosaki cant see me Just like my brother Kurosaki… M-Masked Ichigo is being completely overpowered In his fight with Lord Dordoni… And his fight with Lord Ulquiorra… When Ichigo put on his mask, he always won overwhelmingly When Ichigo was masked, he was invincible But… That Ichigo… is getting so beat up G-Give it your all, Ichigo! Give it your all, Ichigo! Come on! What are you doing! You cheer him on too! Huh Dont “Huh” Nel! Ichigo is fighting for you! So why are you afraid of him! You said that Ichigo was a kind person, right! Thats right! Nel thinks so too! Ichigo is kind! When he heard your name, he lunged at Lord Ulquiorra! Ichigo is human! But hes become a Soul Reaper Hes put on a mask and is using such insane power! Theres no way that he cant be suffering! He has to be suffering! But Ichigo is doing this for you! Hes fighting by using that power and becoming bloodied! Wh-Why arent you cheering him on! Thats right… At first I came here because I wanted to protect everyone I thought I was ready But… I heard that Kurosaki and the others came to save me, and I was happy somewhere in my heart When I saw Kurosaki wearing a mask, I saw that his eyes  looked like my brothers and I became afraid I thought that he may not have come to save me Thats not true Thats actually… None of that really matters I… Im not afraid of Kurosaki What I do fear, is that Kurosaki… It looks like you really are at your limit Its over, Kurosaki Dont die… Dont die, Kurosaki! You dont have to win You dont have to try Just dont get hurt anymore Kurosaki! Sorry, Grimmjow It seems that I… I cant lose to you any longer I dont like it The way he takes me for a fool Damn… He makes me sick Ill destroy you all! Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers!

D-Do you think…that youve won… against me! Kurosaki! Gillians have no sense of self It is said that Gillians, the lowest level of Menos, are born when hundreds of Hollows combine with each other However, that is not correct Hollows eat human souls in order to fill the void of their lost hearts and rid themselves of their hunger for souls But in rare cases, a Hollow appears with an extreme hunger For some reason, they seek out the souls of their fellow Hollows Hollows that want Hollow souls naturally come together and begin eating each other As they do, their souls become entangled, they lose their individuality, and they become giant and foolish Gillains who have immense spiritual power But sometimes one of the Hollows that was eaten has abilities and a sense of self that surpasses the others In such cases, they become a Gillian that has not lost its sense of self That Gillian continues to evolve by eating other Gillians, and soon comes to be called an Adjuchas Those who have become Adjuchas are exposed to a greater fear The fear of regression If an Adjuchas doesnt continue to eat Hollows, it will regress into a Gillian Those who regress are guaranteed to lose their individuality Theyll never become an Adjuchas again Whats this Youre a pretty small Adjuchas Sorry… Im going to eat you Why you… Whats this D Roy was defeated instantly This is a first Guys like this exist, huh Youre strong What is your name, Adjuchas Grimmjow Im Shawlong Join us, Grimmjow I wont ask you to do it for free What are you doing We have no intention of remaining Gillians or Adjuchas We will become Vasto Lordes In order to do that, we need power We need a strong power to draw us all together You are suited for that Lets go together, Grimmjow You…will be our king, Grimmjow Whats with that look on your face Youre always like that No matter how much I best you… You think that you can beat me You think youre stronger than I am! I hate that! What do you hate Do you hate that a mere human is treating you like an equal! That has nothing to do with it! It doesnt matter if youre a human, a Soul Reaper, or an Arrancar! Ill crush anyone who takes me for a fool! Ill begin…with you, Kurosaki! Here I go Wha— What is that! Desgarrón Its my strongest technique What I told you that we give up, Grimmjow How long do you think its been since we started following you Who knows We realized that we cannot become Vasto Lordes Since eating our thousandth Hollow, we can no longer sense our power getting any stronger Todays prey makes three thousand We realized that continuing to do this is useless How stupid If you want to quit, then just go ahead and die Im going Yes, that doesnt matter But if youre going to go, then do it after youve eaten us Those who have had parts of them eaten by other Hollows stop evolving completely D Roy cant become a Vasto Lorde anymore We already know that And our evolution has come to an end You cowards I told you that weve realized something Those who do or dont become Vasto Lordes are probably determined from when they were Hollows No… Perhaps even before then We realize that now From the moment we became Hollows, it was decided that we would become Adjuchas, and you would go beyond that Eat us, Grimmjow Its over, Kurosaki! You make me sick Youre going to lose to me! Youre all cowards Fine… Ill eat you all Become my flesh and blood and watch what happens I… I am the king! Youre… Youre not the only one who wants to win What “I’ll begin with you,” you say That’s my line! Its as you say I came here to fight with you I came here to defeat you, Grimmjow!

Hey… What are we doing A new story starts in the next episode! NEW CAPTAIN SHUSUKE AMAGAI ARC A new captain is coming to 	the Thirteen Court Guard Squads! Are you serious!"
" Ichigo’s battle ended with a victory over Grimmjow and the rescue of Orihime The fight against the Arrancars continues, but that is a story to be told later From here on, a totally new story unfolds Now the curtain rises on a currently unknown battle Did you hear, Captain Squad 3 is getting a new captain! I’m a captain I’ve already been told The official announcement is to be made at tomorrow’s squad leaders’ meeting That Kira… When did he learn to do a Bankai anyway Kira is not the new captain What! He’s not! Don’t scatter the documents! I don’t know the details about the new captain Is that right Well, I didn’t think Kira was suited to be captain anyway I wonder who it’s going to be then We’ll find out tomorrow Never mind that, get back to work! I’m so curious Yesterday our Expedition Unit returned after completing a long-term assignment Without suffering a single casualty, I may add That is a great achievement At the present time, Squads 3, 5, and 9 are without captains As the Thirteen Court Guard Squads, we cannot allow this situation to remain unresolved Therefore… Yesterday the man in charge of the Expedition Unit was summoned Under the attendance of I, Yamamoto, and two other captains, we deliberated over his capabilities as a squad captain Our decision was unanimous Hence, I shall now introduce you all to the new captain who will be replacing former Captain Gin Ichimaru The new Squad 3 Captain of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads, Shusuke Amagai, enter! Shusuke Amagai… Ever heard of him Nope A new face we’ve never even heard of is gonna be our captain I hear he’s been away on a long expedition to suppress Hollows Who cares about that The point is that a total stranger will suddenly be our captain Can we follow such a guy I know, but Lieutenant Kira’s no better Yeah ‘Morning I hope the new captain is nice You’re right We can’t depend on him He wields… two Zanpakuto A solid presence I’m Amagai I’ll do my very best I lack experience, so I ask for your guidance When you’re a captain, there’s a lot of protocol and it may be hard to get used to at first Just come to me if you have any questions Yes sir! Thank you very much Who were the two captains who sat in on the deliberations Does it even matter One empty post has been filled now We should be glad Well, you’re right about that In time, we’ll see just how good Shusuke Amagai is Finally, one position has been filled That means nothing There are still two more to fill At any time, or any place, a void causes discord One who is evil tries to display its power by targeting the most vulnerable spot, by targeting such a void Is he…the new captain Let’s see… Who’s the Lieutenant I’m Squad 3 Lieutenant, Izuru Kira I’m Shusuke Amagai I’m the newly appointed Squad 3 Captain Nice to meet you Same here A pleasure to meet you And he is Makoto Kibune Like myself, he’ll be joining Squad 3 starting today He belonged to one of my Expedition Units But he’s skilled, so I recruited him He’ll be the Third Seat I’m Kibune Pleased to meet you So that’s him He’s wearing the captain’s coat He’s the one, all right Well… Compared to the other captains he’s kind of… What’s the matter Well… You see, Squad 3 was fine without a captain until yesterday Stop! Well, I know how you all feel After all, someone you don’t even know suddenly shows up and tells you, “Hey, I’ll be your captain starting today” I don’t blame you for feeling put off But, I will say this much As long as I’m your captain, I will protect you That is a captain’s duty But you don’t even know how good this captain is, right Well, you’re right, but… As far as the squad is concerned, there’s a huge feeling of uncertainty towards the captain And the thought of having to pull them all together tomorrow is… I’m not sure Jeez, what’s the big deal It’s just a case of them teaching the cocky new transfer student a lesson I know But I’m the one who’ll be caught in between Okay, okay You’re nervous about the whole thing Well then… Here Good ol’ sake Drink away your worries I can’t drink in broad daylight Silly… That’s why it tastes so good! Oh, yeah Why not have a party with all the Squad 3 members A few drinks and you’ll all be buddies in no time Is that how it works Just take my word for it and try I see So that’s where you hide your sake bottles, eh! Captain… This is… I mean…Kira was… Matsumoto! This is… It’s a welcome party for you and Third Seat Kibune, sir Huh For us Well, thank you everyone I received some advice that this will help solidify our bond Please, sir Let me pour for you Huh Oh, I… Is something the matter Sure – So much… – Huh Oh, nothing All right! Okay, everyone! Let’s begin the welcome party for Captain Amagai and Third Seat Kibune This is bad I’ve never been to a party this depressing It’s having the opposite effect Now, a toast from Captain Amagai! Sir, take a shot of sake O-Okay Everyone, I’m counting on you all! Captain, I see you’re one who can drink! Not really A-Are you all right Jeez… Throwing a party like this for me I’m so happy Yup I feel great Captain What’s wrong Captain Amagai! What happened – What’s going on – Is he… Captain! Captain! Actually, the captain has zero tolerance for alcohol Huh He just had one shot He gets drunk on pickles made from sake yeast Then why didn’t he just refuse Well… I think he read the mood and felt he shouldn’t refuse Someone! Get me a pail of water and a towel Yes sir! What’ll we do, Lieutenant I guess we can’t continue the party with Captain Amagai in this condition Shall we wrap it up Now, now… Since you set up this opportunity for us, why don’t we talk a bit more and get to know one another I’d like to learn all of your names and faces as much as I can I hear Squad 3 is having a party Yes, in broad daylight It’s a welcome party for Captain Amagai How nice What’s nice Sake tastes best when you start drinking during the day, Nanao ‘Cuz you can get really plastered I wonder if this Captain Amagai is a drinker I wouldn’t know I wonder if we can become friends Who knows You’re no fun, Nanao Thank you What’ll we do Ignore him After all, we’ve managed until now with just Lieutenant Kira Who needs a captain like that That’s true I was a fool for taking Matsumoto’s advice Lieutenant Kira Third Seat Kibune The solidarity of Squad 3 is very strong You think so I understand you’ve kept the squad together in the absence of a captain I’m very impressed It was nothing A directive for Squad 3 of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads! This is an emergency! This is an emergency! Menos have appeared in the Precipice World in Area 0035! Presently, they are headed towards Soul Society! There are 13 of them! Thirteen! That many Menos in the Precipice World! That’s impossible I am ordering Squad 3 of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads to defeat the Menos who have infiltrated the Precipice World! Make preparations immediately and go to the Precipice World! Well What should we do I don’t know Lieutenant! We must go! But… It can’t be helped! I will request that the Restrictive Current be quarantined! You must take command! All right We will now enter the Precipice World to destroy the Menos! It seems Squad 3 will be going Perhaps the Seireitei is on the verge of change What A man who distinguished himself in an expedition assignment is suddenly named as captain That never happened before I know, but… Who were the two captains who participated in Shusuke Amagai’s appointment I don’t know But I do know this much… Something new is beginning We will split into small groups of four and confront the enemy Our enemies are Menos! Take every precaution! Enter! They’re coming! Each group spread out! Raise your head, Wabisuke! Out of thirteen Menos, five have been destroyed! Eight remain Everyone, just a few more! Hang in there! Yes sir! What’s that The Restrictive Current is back! Why! It’s supposed to be quarantined! The Restrictive Current That’s impossible! What’s going on! The Restrictive Current Cleaner has appeared! Distance to Squad 3… 200 meters! The cause is unknown! It can’t be stopped! Third Seat Kibune! What’s the meaning of this! I don’t know I know my request to quarantine the Restrictive Current was received Retreat! I will cover the rear! We must hurry! Thanks, Third Seat Kibune! Hurry! We can’t outrun it! Move! Captain Amagai! Stay back! Are you nuts I thought I told you… As long as I’m your captain, I will protect you! Please take a good look at Captain Amagai’s true power Kibune… You’re sure you requested that the Restrictive Current be quarantined Yes I can’t believe the Department of Research and Development would miss such a request Something is strange about this But, whatever Anyone hurt N-No sir! Good Kira! Yes sir! Good work Just what I’d expect from someone who filled in during a captain’s absence No… It’s nothing I’m glad you’re all okay Let’s go back! He’s an extraordinary guy Yeah, he’s amazing Captain Amagai! Are you ok He’s… This man… He did that while still drunk Someone, help me R-Right! Let’s go back Lieutenant Kira! R-Right Why did you choose to send out Squad 3 It was the perfect opportunity for the newcomer to show his skills According to the report, Squad 3 was in the midst of a party Was there a reason you sent them into battle drunk It was an initiation! Arrancar Encyclopedia! ARRANCAR ENCYCLOPEDIA Today, we’ll talk about Ichigo Kurosaki’s Hollowfication When Ichigo Kurosaki hollowfies, the frightening Spiritual Pressure is like an Espada’s Why am I in this corner! Why You’re more like an Arrancar than a Soul Reaper Not! By the way, is it true that Squad 3 has a new captain Yup, seems like it Oh, it’s him I see Well, it’ll be tough Huh You know him! As if! Hang in there, Izuru"
" Shusuke Amagai is named the new captain of Squad 3, which had been without a commander since Aizen’s rebellion Kira organizes a welcoming party to help members of Squad 3 get to know their new captain, who they are still unsure of But Amagai, who cannot handle liquor, gets drunk and faints In this inopportune moment, an alert goes off stating that Menos have infiltrated the Precipice World and the squad is ordered into action Kira and the squad leave Amagai behind and go to attack But the Restrictive Current, which should have been quarantined, is released and the men are in peril Just then, Amagai, who was supposed to be in a drunken stupor, appears and saves his men with his amazing power It will be a while until dawn The things I arranged for haven’t arrived yet We will have to wait here for the time being I’m hungry That’s the last of it All right One, two… Ichigo! Oh yeah Mornin— What! Damned old man… He always gives me a headache in the morning You mustn’t speak of your father in that manner Shut up! Say Ichigo, did you know that Ms Hosaka, the neighbor behind us, moved out Yeah, I saw them earlier She suddenly came to say goodbye yesterday, and seemed to be in a real hurry I wonder what happened Maybe she got sick of our old man’s behavior Absolutely not! She constantly praised me for always seeing eye-to-eye with my children! Meaning you’re stupid and childish What! Since when did you become such a jerk! It saddens me The glass that was stuck in my butt just went up deeper! – Thanks for breakfast – Are you all right Let’s go, Rukia! Ichigo!

Kurosaki! You guys! Cripes… You still can’t control your Spiritual Pressure! We have to get back quickly The second period will begin Thanks Those arrows are perfect for dealing with large numbers Almost like pesticides How rude of you I didn’t come here to hear that There was Spiritual Pressure from a Soul Reaper that I didn’t recognize Yeah… I saw them Although it was just briefly It seems they used bait to lure those Hollows Bait Huh Like the one you used before The composition is probably different, but the potency is the same Do you know where they went No, they’ve disappeared What were they up to anyway Huh A princess! Ichigo said she spoke like one Right Yeah A princess… But, the things she said weren’t princess-like She kept talking about being hungry and pounced on me Sounds like she was messing with you A princess who’d make sport of Kurosaki Oh! Did she wear a revealing black leather outfit with spiky patent leather boots with lots of weapons and say something like, “So who’s really hungry Me!” Or something like that Inoue, that doesn’t sound like a princess, but more like a queen Doesn’t matter But say, Rukia, what’re you doing there Yeah… I’m researching those two Soul Reapers and the princess you saw, but… KUROSAKI CLINIC Enough already Give it up! All that beeping is so irritating! You be quiet! For a Soul Reaper to come to the World of the Living, he must pass through the Senkaimon And there should be a record of all passages, which I can access Jeez! This manual is so hard to read! Sis! Just leave that to me I’m known as the “world’s top manual reader”! What the hell is that Shut up! I also was created by the Department of Research and Development Don’t take me lightly! Okay, try it Really Oh then, here I come! I’m in heaven Hey… Well Oh, yes Right away Oh… I don’t understand it Oh, Ichigo! Huh! Now what Move-in!

You’re the one who lured all those Hollows here! Don’t know anything about it Do you have any proof that we brought them here Don’t kid around! Ichigo! It is you, after all, Ichigo! Forget the formalities I know you came to offer your greetings She’s the “princess” Yeah… Hey you! How do you know my name! – We did some checking, you know – Enryu, what are you doing! What! Insolent fellow! Isn’t it obvious that there is a world of difference between you and us! – If I have need of you, I shall contact you – Move, you’re in the way! Lady Rurichiyo, it will be dark soon Hollows like those from earlier today may appear Please return to the mansion now I see I guess it can’t be helped Ichigo, I will see you again! Her name should be Byakuya! My brother is nothing like her! Hey! I’m not done talking to you! Hey you! Put up a barrier, did you! Come on out! Hey! – Damn him! – Don’t exhaust yourself We don’t know who he is, but his Bakudo is impressive I’m going out Sis, please wait! Don’t leave me! We’re outside, pipe down!

" One day, a large number of Hollows suddenly appeared in Karakura Town Ichigo and Rukia left to exterminate the Hollows, and in the midst of battle, they encountered a strange trio Ishida and the others arrived to help, and the Hollows were promptly dealt with Ichigo went after the strange trio only to find that they had disappeared However, he meets them once more in a totally unexpected place They have moved in next door, behind the Kurosaki Clinic Furthermore, the following day, it turns out that they are to be Ichigo’s classmates What! She’s cute! He’s huge! What is that A giant! That girl has to be in grade school! Two adults and a child! I am Kenryu This man on my left is Enryu And this person here is… I am Rurichiyo Kasumiohji!

Where’d you move from Very far away How come you three transferred together We’re related Where do you live That’s a secret What’re your body measurements You even go after girls like her! But, she’s so cute! How come only you are answering all the questions, Kenryu Lady Rurichiyo is a person of high nobility It is a waste of her time to reply to those beneath her Beneath her Aw, come on Don’t exaggerate You there Do not get too friendly with Lady Rurichiyo Huh If you become too friendly with her… you’ll lose your life N-No way By the way, Ichigo… What is it What How come she’ll talk to Ichigo, but I get threatened F-Forget what I just said Ichigo! School is a strange place indeed Why Everyone is dressed alike Are they Soul Reapers Nope Lady Rurichiyo is directly addressing you Answer more politely! Not so close, guys Ichigo! I am thirsty Say, do you always talk like that Do I sound funny Well, this isn’t the feudal age F-Forget what I just said There’s nothing wrong with the way you speak In fact, I like it To each his own taste Yup, I think it’s cute too Bring me something to drink, Ichigo Why me Go! Be grateful that Lady Rurichiyo herself is ordering you Why you… Come on… Go buy her some juice at least, Ichigo Be kind to transfer students Oh, okay This is getting to be a chore Serve me well, Ichigo What’re those guys doing Oh, Ichigo Are you going home We are also heading home now Lady Rurichiyo! Let us go together You’re going the same way Well, yeah Oh then, we’ll be together part of the way Let’s go! Ichigo, let us go! This will not do! We chose today’s route home after careful investigation We cannot waste any time lingering with others Huh! Please heed our request No! I am going home with Ichigo! I will buy you a sweet snack on the way home, so please bear with it The sweets in this world are delicious! Really Ichigo, I shall see you again! Something’s up, after all They’re being way too careful You are a wonderful cook, Kenryu! Thank you very much It has been a while since I had as much fun as I did today I’m glad to hear that Can I go to school again tomorrow Yes, of course Oh, I’m looking forward to it! I can see Ichigo Kurosaki again tomorrow Huh! Lady Rurichiyo, he is… He is a fine man And strong No, no! You must not warm up to him so easily! He is far beneath you! If you become too close to him, there may be serious consequences! Consequences Such as what Well… That is… I know Both of you are such worrywarts Now then, I shall have my dinner! Yes It looks delicious What! The same class! Are you serious Yes They ingeniously used Memory Replacement to transfer to our class without raising any suspicion Ichigo, do you think they’re… There is no mistake that they have business with you But if so, why Rukia… Weren’t you checking them out Yes, but there was no sign that they used the Senkaimon And that gigai, I’m certain it’s from Urahara But they refuse to answer my questions, claiming it’s a trade secret This is starting to smell very fishy! Ichigo! Let’s sneak into their place and find out once and for all! Forget it, that’s a pain Huh! Why Aren’t you curious Mr Urahara is leaving them alone So there probably isn’t anything wrong We all have our circumstances Let’s leave them alone for a while Ichigo… You’re right Huh! Aren’t you worried! I’m so worried I can’t sleep! Ichigo! It’s from next door! Is it his Spiritual Pressure In any case, this Spiritual Pressure isn’t normal Let’s go, Rukia! What’s the ruckus Can’t a person sleep in peace You! What are you doing Your Spiritual Pressure isn’t the same as earlier today What’s going on I’m a Substitute Soul Reaper, so I can’t ignore this Explain yourself Otherwise… What! It’s here! What! This Spiritual Pressure… Why you… Damn it! Kenryu! Who is this guy Ichigo Kurosaki, I leave the rest to you Huh! Hey you! He ran off Those guys… Just who are you You don’t seem to be from the Stealth Force Wait! Where do you think you’re going So it’s Rurichiyo and her men he’s after Seems that way Why are you after Rurichiyo and her guys Speak up! Ichigo! What was that! I lost consciousness for a second What’s the matter, Ichigo! Rukia! What the hell is that anyway You mean his Zanpakuto’s power Watch out, Ichigo The light reflected off from his blade… It’s not just a smoke screen I know that Ichigo! Don’t look at the light! Damn it! His swordmanship… Are you an assassin! Assassin Rukia! Ichigo! Capture him alive! We’ll make him tell us why he’s after Rurichiyo! I know! Damn you! Ichigo! Ichigo! Don’t look at the light! Keep your eyes on the enemy! Easy for you to say! Ichigo! I can bring down a guy like you without looking at your face Your Zanpakuto reflects the light from the moon and it seems to knock out any opponent who looks at it for an instant In order to do that, you must always come around to face me directly Once I figured that out… Sorry, but you’re no longer a challenge Now, you’re gonna talk! Why are you after Rurichiyo and her men Answer! Like I’ll let you get away! W-What! Did he kill himself What! It seems Rurichiyo and her men are involved in a dire situation I see you got rid of the assassin Ichigo Kurosaki, I must praise your good— What was that for! That’s for running off and leaving us to fight This time, you will tell us your predicament I’ll ask Inoue to come I should call Ishida and Chad too Lady Rurichiyo Kasumiohji is… Kasumiohji As in, the Kasumiohji Clan You know them, Kuchiki They are high-ranking aristocrats next to the four great noble families Come on Why didn’t you remember that the first time you heard the name Kasumiohji Kuchiki… Kuchiki! Kuchiki as in the Kuchiki Clan! Well, yes Oh, forgive our rudeness! I never imagined I’d find someone belonging to the Kuchiki Clan in a place like this! And you guys! Why did it take you this long to recognize the name, Kuchiki Kurosaki… Things won’t move forward if you keep on questioning! It’s not my fault! No need for the formality Don’t bow Lady Rurichiyo is the legitimate heir of the Kasumiohji Clan It would have been fine if her parents, the previous heads of the family, were alive Lady Rurichiyo’s mother, the previous head of family, died shortly after giving birth to her Then her father immediately followed in death from an illness We have been her stewards since she was born, and we raised her She hasn’t taken over as head of the household yet She was so young We thought it better to wait until she was older But that turned into a problem There is a man named Gyokaku Kumoi who is currently the provisional administrator of the Kasumiohji Clan Lately, vassals have begun to disappear from his service It seems he gets rid of vassals who don’t agree with him There are signs that Kumoi is taking advantage of his position and is trying to take over the Kasumiohji Clan A coup d’état And recently, strange things have been occurring around Lady Rurichiyo Don’t tell me… Yes Kumoi is finding Lady Rurichiyo, the legitimate heir to the Kasumiohji Clan, a hindrance Hence, the child’s assassination How cruel Do you have proof We thought it was too dangerous to ignore, so in order to protect Lady Rurichiyo… We didn’t tell even the closest vassals, and left under the cover of the night mist We passed through the Senkaimon that is expressly for the use of the Kasumiohji Clan and escaped to the World of the Living That’s why the Soul Pager couldn’t find a record of it As you know, Soul Pagers cannot access data relating to private Senkaimon Huh What’s wrong Ichigo Kurosaki… We have heard of you, even in Soul Society Your strength is amazing I bore witness to it Huh Assassins are certain to come after Lady Rurichiyo again They belong to a special assassination squad secretly assembled by Kumoi using the Kasumiohji Clan’s political influence Ichigo Kurosaki, please become Lady Rurichiyo’s bodyguard! H-Hold on a minute! Please! If news of the strife within a noble family is made public, the Kasumiohji Clan will face disbanding That is why we cannot appeal to the Soul Reapers of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads! Luckily, you are a Substitute Soul Reaper, not a legitimate Soul Reaper Yeah, but… Please! We alone cannot defend against Kumoi’s assassins! What if we capture the assassin and present him to Kumoi as proof of his treachery He will only deny knowing the assassin Besides, when they fail their mission, they commit suicide Furthermore, they use ominous techniques and are extremely skilled Ichigo, do it I’ll help too Miss Kuchiki, you too! We cannot possibly ask you No I belong to the Kuchiki Clan I’ve experienced first-hand, the trials and tribulations of an aristocratic family I cannot ignore your plight I guess I have no choice Thank you! There’s one other thing Lady Rurichiyo is not aware that she is being targeted And we don’t want her to know We don’t want to hurt her with such knowledge Hence, we want her to remain totally unaware of the real situation What! That’s… Forgive us! Cripes… Lost to a Substitute Soul Reaper Yes This Substitute Soul Reaper seems to be very skilled Why would someone like a substitute aid the Princess We must speed things up, or there could be problems Very well I’ll leave it to you Taking over a clan is quite a chore Ichigo, is it true that you’re gonna be a bodyguard next Yeah Things turned out that way before I knew it All right! I don’t like the idea that it’s a small little girl, but I’ll do my very best too You can rely on me! Then, you can stay and watch the house All right… What, again! Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! – Yeah! – Yeah! MENS SOUL REAPER ASSOCIATION MEN’S LAVATORY Vice-President, what is the agenda Huh You’re asking me Did you forget the… We are discussing the Soul Pager today Quit that Hiroshima dialect You can’t even use it properly Men must have the special Soul Pager with twist-on headbands You too, idiot!

" An unknown enemy attacks Rurichiyo Kasumiohji, who is from the Soul Society and has transferred to Ichigo’s school Ichigo tries to identify the enemy but the assassin, in defeat, commits suicide at the scene Rurichiyo is in fact the princess of the Kasumiohji Clan who got caught up in an inheritance dispute and escaped to the World of the Living Ichigo is forced to accept the role of bodyguard for Rurichiyo Today was another fun day Yes, Lady Rurichiyo Though it’s annoying for us Ichigo Kurosaki… You sometimes have a problem with your choice of words in relation to the princess Please be careful Huh As far as I’m concerned, this one is… What’s with you! Get out of my way! Come on, stop it! Get out of my way! – Hey, do something! – It is because you did not respond quickly All right! I get it already! Cripes… Yesterday you get down on your knees to beg me, and now this is the attitude I get What do you mean, down on your knees Did Kenryu and Enryu ask you to do something Huh Lady Rurichiyo is not aware that she is being targeted And we don’t want her to know Hence, we want her to remain totally unaware of the real situation Uh, well… Just some tips on how to get along with the community in this world Right Yes Last night Ichigo Kurosaki was teaching us the social customs regarding the World of the Living Yes Huh Princess! Ichigo! What is this Princess, this is a vending machine What does it do It… Here Try a sip Princess! Don’t worry It is orange! It tastes like orange! Drinks are sold in this machine Hey, Ichigo! In this world, there are a lot of interesting items here that I don’t know about! So, do not hesitate to teach me much, much more! Is that the attitude to have when asking someone for something O-Okay! I’ll explain a little at a time to Rurichiyo Address her as Lady Rurichiyo! Too close It’s okay, Kenryu I have a huge heart, therefore I shall forgive Ichigo for his indiscretion How generous of you, Princess! I, Kenryu, admire you! You overreact, Kenryu! Madam Rurichiyo! Shall we see a few more interesting items from this world Where might that be I’m sure you will have fun! Here A job well done! Madam Rurichiyo! Next, let’s all do that together! See how happy the princess looks I’m glad we brought her to this world Don’t cry You guys… Have you thought about what you’re going to do next There’s no need for you to point out the obvious Well, you better hurry up and decide We don’t know when those weirdos will come around again Miss Kuchiki, I had never been to such a fun place! I’m glad to hear that Okay, I’ll take you home That’s all right I can get home by myself But… I tell you… Those two worry too much Going on by themselves to inspect the house before even allowing me to go in It is so stifling It can’t be helped Brother! Hey, Yuzu! I’m home! Welcome home! You’re late tonight Oh Is that the person who moved in behind our house My name is Rurichiyo Kasumiohji Good evening, I’m Yuzu Kurosaki Oh, you are a high school student I thought so What is a high school Come on, Rurichiyo Let’s go! Hey, Brother! Since we’re neighbors, why don’t you invite her for dinner What Delicious! Really! Yes, very delicious The tastes of the World of the Living are quite good! World of the Living Really Yuzu, your cooking is always delicious! Aristocratic meals are nothing but manners and they are so boring Don’t you agree Miss Kuchiki Aristocratic! Never mind the details, Yuzu Huh But… She’s a little different, this one Rurichiyo, what’s wrong I don’t like this Oh, you don’t like carrots I’m sorry What are you saying Farmers work very, very hard to grow these vegetables Eat them all Farmers grow these Yeah… Just growing one of these vegetables is a lot of work Eating them with curry is very delicious! D-Don’t worry about it Don’t spoil her! Wait! Just who are you people! Pardon us, so late at night You guys… Ichigo Kurosaki! How dare you force Lady Rurichiyo to eat carrots! Huh I can’t even remember how many stewards have been heavily punished in the past for serving carrots Well, in this case, you didn’t know, so… As for members of the Kurosaki family, we will make a special exception What! Me Listen! You guys spoil her like that, and she’ll become more ignorant of the world! It is none of your business! Keep your mouth shut! Ichigo! You ask a favor of someone and that’s the language I get from you! Favor What’s this about, Kenryu With a princess as noble as yourself, we believed we were a little short-handed Are you… hiding something from me N-No Kenryu! Enryu! Why can’t you tell me the truth! Princess… If Mother and Father were here… I’m sure they would have told me about farmers! Until now, I never cared to think of how foods were prepared! I’m not an idiot I understand what you were saying earlier, Ichigo But, Princess… That’s enough! You two are always hiding something from me! I do not believe you! I hate you guys, Kenryu! Rurichiyo! Yuzu! She hates us The princess hates us I tell you, those guys Why act like it’s none of your business, Ichigo Half of this is because of you All right, already Hey, pull yourself together! I’m at fault, too I’ll apologize with you, okay Ichigo! Yuzu! Karin! Rurichiyo really ran away! Hey! Come on, she’s right here No, that’s just her gigai Lady Rurichiyo! Where are you Where are you! It seems she turned back into a soul This is bad If she gets attacked by an assassin… Either way, let’s split up and search for her! Okay Kenryu, that idiot Enryu, that… Ouch… Rurichiyo It is you, Rurichiyo! What are you doing here You are… Oh yes, you are Orihime! That’s correct! It’s Orihime Orihime Inoue I wouldn’t forget Your name, “Hime,” implies that you are also a princess from a noble family, does it not The “hime” is just in my name You are a “hime” but not a princess The World of the Living is strange Hey, Rurichiyo… Why are you by yourself Where are Mr Kenryu and Mr Enryu I do not know such people Did something happen It is true that I never ate carrots, and usually left them But, I could eat them if I tried to And yet, those two were always hiding something from me Mr Kenryu and Mr Enryu care deeply for you, don’t they Rurichiyo You are so important, so they didn’t want to make you worry about anything It does not seem that way Kenryu and Enryu are only treating me as a child Hey, Rurichiyo… When you’re cared for too much, you begin to take it for granted You only end up regretting it if you realize that once they’re gone Orihime… See That’s why you have to understand I said some terrible things to those two I do not believe you! I hate you guys, Kenryu! Will they forgive me It will be okay! Let’s go home! Okay! My hat! Look out! Who are you! Are you committing this act of violence, knowing that I am Rurichiyo Kasumiohji! Orihime! It’s okay! Huh What! W-What is this This way! We’re blocked in! That can’t be Why! Why is he after me To do this kind of thing… Santenkesshun! Is this because I came to the World of the Living in secret Or am I being punished for causing trouble to so many people No! Rurichiyo, you haven’t done anything wrong! Then why I…can’t hold it any longer I don’t like this I don’t like this! Kenryu! Enryu! Princess! Kenryu! Enryu! Are you all right, Princess Kenryu! You came for me! Enryu, too Forgive me I was wrong Rurichiyo! Kurosaki! Kuchiki! You’re late, Kurosaki! What happened That! He’s… He’s with that guy from the other day! Be on your guard! Okay! Be careful, Ichigo! He might use some tricky technique Got it! What! H-Hey, Rukia! What’s going on here! It appears to be a technique that converts a bladed attack into walls I’m stuck! Damn! Oh no! Rurichiyo! I-Ichigo! Please leave this enemy to me! Kenryu! Bloom in glory… Benishidare! Oh, how pretty! What are you playing around with! I’m not playing around! Look! Huh! My Benishidare’s pollen will sprout flowers onto any weapon it touches, rendering them useless! Don’t you have something better That’s amazing! Don’t get impressed by that Now’s your chance, Ichigo Kurosaki! Right! Getsugatensho! Pale Fire Crash! H-Hey! All right you, let’s find out who put you up to this Why the hell are you all held up! What happened to your flowers You’re the one that blew away the pollen! My Benishidare’s pollen only works in the area where it floats! Useless But I’m prepared for this situation Yes! He’s blinded! Now’s our chance! You take care of the rest! Are they serious about that technique You’ve got it all wrong! Let me show you how to shoot an attack Getsugatensho! That’s far enough! Now, you will spill it! On whose orders are you here to kill Lady Rurichiyo What! Rukia! Damn! Again This is how they work It looks like it’s all over Yes A fabulous Substitute Soul Reaper he is! But… Who was that anyway Just a common night thief Princess, you have nothing to worry about I’m telling you, don’t treat me like a child Rurichiyo! Sir Kenryu, are you all right Yes, thank you Ichigo Kurosaki, even you did good! I shall give you my thanks! You don’t look like you’re grateful at all Are you okay, Rurichiyo Yes, I’m fine That’s because Kenryu and Enryu protected me! Princess… Let’s go home and continue our meal Yes, but… Don’t worry! I won’t leave my carrots! If I do… I can’t face those who raised me! Princess! Princess, please don’t wander off like that again – I was… I was… – I know… – Hey! – I know now, – Hurry up,  – so don’t make such a shamed face or we’re going to leave you behind Hey, wait Ichigo! Enryu! Will you cut it out already! Ichigo Kurosaki! Ichigo Kurosaki! What is it, so early in the morning W-What are you doing! That doesn’t matter! Lady Rurichiyo has disappeared again! So your family makes curry with carrots in it, Kurosaki Huh My curry only has normal ingredients Aroid potatoes, elephant yam and sweet beans That’s normal It was delicious, Inoue You had some!

You’re putting too much effort into this, Lieutenant Kira Lieutenant, please confirm Oh, okay MISSING CAT: MALE -AGE 3 No mistake, this is the cat Mission complete then Why are we chasing after missing cats for the aristocrats, anyway Yesterday, it was security guards for a clothing store sale Recently, it’s been nothing but this kind of work I’m sure our captain has his reasons What do you think, Lieutenant Kira Huh Well, that’s… I wonder I prefer work that I can be more enthusiastic about Now, now… That aside, how about we go for a drink Sounds good Let’s go How about you, Lieutenant Kira I have to write up our report Excuse me You’re back, Izuru What’s wrong No it’s… I was a bit startled by being called by my first name I thought it would help me fit in with the squad more by calling everyone by their first name Don’t like it Uh…well… It takes some getting used to Oh, I see I thought it was a good idea Guess I’ll think of something else Here is today’s report Oh And… About tomorrow’s schedule… What’s this about doing wall repairs for the Squad 12 barracks Wall repair is just that, repairing a wall That’s not what I’m trying to say Why do we have to do that The others in the squad are also… Kira, you may not like hearing this, but… Squad 3 is the one whose previous captain, Gin Ichimaru, betrayed us You understand, don’t you Once you lose trust, it’s difficult to gain it back I don’t know how things will play out, but it’s better to do this than not Relax, Kira Seeing you makes me think that the previous captain, Gin Ichimaru, played too big of a role in this squad Huh You’re different from Ichimaru No one expects the same from you Having a charismatic captain is one way to bring together a team But it can easily break down once that pillar of support is gone That’s why I want to re-build a new squad together with you and Kibune, with the three of us acting as the pillar of support for this squad So, what happened to Third Seat Kibune Well… IZAKAYA KAMEGAMEYA He’s drinking with the others After the fight the other day, Inose and the others seemed to have warmed up to Third Seat Kibune I see Then I think I’ll call it a day too If something’s bothering you, go take a break and have some fun! Huh Um… See you later Have a nice evening, sir Today, you’ll be trained in a new fighting method Recently, there’s been an increase in strong enemies like the Menos Such as that Precipice World incident from the other day From now on, you must practice working together with your fellow squad members in battle, or else you’ll die Anyway, this training is to make sure that doesn’t happen Kibune… Sir! Pick one of these colored headbands I’m going to say a color and those wearing that color will be the enemy The rest of you take on the enemies in groups of three But, the enemy color will change periodically The moment I say another color, the roles will reverse This is to help you develop your decision-making reflexes Kibune, you get in the group and lead this exercise Sir! I will join too That’s okay, Kira Huh I devised this battle method back when I was with the Expedition Unit I want Kibune, who’s familiar with the operation, to lead this training Yes, sir Sorry Let’s go! – Yes, sir! – Yes, sir! First, purple! Uh… Aida, come with me! Yes, sir! Inose! Join me in back! Sir! Next, yellow! Next, red! Good! Keep it up! Amazing… Since when did everyone become so organized Captain Amagai’s fighting methods are different from anything we’ve done before! Captain Ichimaru never used group fighting methods It actually felt like we could put up a good fight by working together! Yeah! I really like Captain Amagai’s style! And Third Seat Kibune too! That guy seems more reliable than Lieutenant Kira! Soon there might be a change in Lieutenants Idiot, you’re going too far! Oops… Lieutenant Kira Huh Oh, Third Seat Kibune You’re okay… with what they said just now Well…uh… Is that so I must say, Third Seat Kibune, you’re amazing Not at all I can’t compare to how you, Lieutenant Kira, have organized Squad 3 until now That’s not true Everyone seems to have accepted you More than me But… It’s fine! Don’t bother with me! Oh, sorry I’m a little tired If you’ll excuse me One more! You’re a strong drinker, Kira! Okay, you can have some of my drink! You sure can drink Say… Did something happen It’s okay! Squad 3 is going to change from now on! It’ll be different than the Squad 3 before Okay, okay! When the captain changes, the atmosphere of the whole squad changes I can understand your confusion Thanks to Captain Amagai, Squad 3’s reputation has improved He’s done good in such a short time I…think so to Then be proud! If you act like this, how can I put it… that new Third Seat guy in Squad 3… Third Seat Kibune Yeah! He could take away your title as Lieutenant! Huh! That’s right, I’m unreliable anyway Iba! Huh Uh… Yeah… Uh oh, I think we touched a nerve Welcome! Party of two, this way! – Welcome! – Welcome! Do you have a private room Yes, we do! Speak of the devil Why’s he with Captain Kyoraku So, cheers I’m happy to have been invited for a drink with the new squad captain everyone’s talking about I’m still new to this role, so getting to know the senior members is also part of my job So, what is it you wanted to talk with me about I’ll be straight with you Sounds good I don’t like beating around the bush About the Thirteen Court Guard Squads… Would it be possible for the squads to work more closely together That’s…a difficult subject I don’t expect to be able to do so right away, but at this rate… Now, don’t get so excited Oh… I’m sorry But, I like your thinking It’s not bad You understand! Amagai, you’re young but you’re pretty thoughtful Oh no! Not at all I know! If we’re talking about these things, maybe we should talk with Ukitake too You mean the captain of Squad13 Yeah This doesn’t mean I won’t cooperate I just don’t like taking the lead So, next time, let’s call on Ukitake and talk What do you think By all means! Okay! Let’s start again with a toast! Huh You’re not drinking No…I…uh… Come on Thank you! Hey, hey, hey! Don’t tell me…you can’t drink! Really Lieutenant Kira, East Area 7, no unusual activity Good job, Third Seat Kibune All’s quiet in the inner court Is that so That’s good to know Is something wrong Uh, no… It’s nothing Oh, yes! How about some tea Lieutenant Kira What is it Sorry for being so rude in asking but, why do you always seem so unconfident Huh Well… Uh… Urgent message! There’s a suspicious shadow near the execution grounds Lieutenant! Lieutenant! Third Seat! Uh… You are… Shinta Seko Sorry, I couldn’t remember your name That’s okay I’m still new and don’t have a seat ranking yet Where did it happen Near this hole I saw the suspicious shadow earlier, and tried to go after it What happened Well… It seems to have disappeared inside this hole Inside the execution grounds! Nothing would survive this fall, right At this rate… Lieutenant! Third Seat Kibune… Are you all right I’ll be fine I see But why did the ground suddenly… It’s impossible to climb up There should be an entrance somewhere that brings in the criminals here Let’s look for it Yes This Spiritual Pressure… This is… Why in a place like this So many… But if it’s only this level of Hollow… Stop it! Rampage… Reppu! Third Seat Kibune… This is bad! If the Hollows get outside… What is he doing Raise your head, Wabisuke! What are you doing, Third Seat Kibune! Just putting and end to the Hollows But, what about Seko That fool has failed to carry out his duties as a Soul Reaper Falling into enemy hands, and now lying before us in disgrace What As one who has taken up the role of a Soul Reaper, he should be prepared to die in battle By becoming a burden, this scum has endangered us all He doesn’t deserve to live How could you say such a thing Why do you attempt to save that scum You’re too soft! What! It’s that attitude of yours that made you fail to prevent the former captain’s rebellion beforehand Isn’t that right! That’s… I… It appears you lack the will as well Hey! Are you guys all right Captain Amagai… Captain! A member was attacked by Hollows and is heavily injured! Wait there! I’ll have the med crew get down there! Please! Captain, what about the Hollows that fled into the sky Yeah, some squad members nearby saw it and informed me We took care of it Is that so Sorry We’ve transported Seko to the Squad 4 facility However, his wounds are deep We’re not sure if he’ll survive I see… And about the ground that collapsed… There are traces of it being made to collapse that way Was there anything you noticed Is something wrong, you two Uh… That is… No, nothing What So strange of you two You! What are you going to do about my test Hollows! Were those Hollows from Squad 12 Yes… It seems someone has unlocked the testing facility and had freed all the Hollows Who would do that How should I know! Nemu! You weren’t watching carefully, and this is what happened! You fool! I’m sorry, Master Mayuri Damn it, I’m really upset! Captain of Squad 3! You, too! Why didn’t you try to keep them alive! I can’t do my tests now! Now, now… Don’t get angry What is it! There’s no one here A malfunction Abarai, why where you with Iba today He forced me come with him to discuss the future of the Mens Soul Reaper Association There’s no chance against the Womens Soul Reaper Association, anyway You’re so right It’s that kind of attitude that gets us ridiculed! Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers Byakuya, what is it that you wanted to talk to me about Ichigo Kurosaki… Itchy! I found you! Yachiru, what are you doing here I fixed up Byakki’s house and made a hidden tunnel I’ll show you too! – Okay, okay! Sorry, Byakuya – Hurry up! How long do you intend to address me by my first name"
" Trouble arises over succession rights in one of Soul Society’s high-ranking aristocratic families, the Kasumiohji Clan Their princess, Rurichiyo Kasumiohji, traveled to the World of the Living Ichigo reluctantly agrees to become her bodyguard Rurichiyo, who is unaware that her life is being targeted, turns Ichigo’s life upside down with her naive behavior One day she runs away from the house over a trivial argument with her stewards, Kenryu and Enryu, and encounters an enemy assassin in town Orihime, who happened to be near, makes an attempt to fight him alone But Orihime and Rurichiyo are in great danger against this assassin, who has a strange Zanpakuto Then Ichigo appears just in time to save them Ichigo Kurosaki! Ichigo Kurosaki! What is it, so early in the morning Huh W-What are you doing! That doesn’t matter! Lady Rurichiyo has disappeared again! What is it Is someone returning from the World of the Living There’s no one here A malfunction Princess… Oh, it’s you, Kumoi Princess! Oh! It’s the princess! I’m glad to see you are well Princess… Where have you been all this time, without telling me I was with Kenryu and Enryu I do not need your permission for everything I do I beg to differ If anything should happen to you, you are not the one who will be put to shame The shame will be on the Kasumiohji Clan Namely, your late mother and father I know that without you telling me Then you must behave like a princess of the Kasumiohji Clan Do you understand O-Oh yes, prepare my palanquin And where are you off to this time A tea ceremony! Are you there, Hanza Yes, Sir Kumoi For some unknown reason, she has returned from the World of the Living Furthermore, without Kenryu or Enryu Do not let this opportunity pass Understood Not again! Be prepared What! What’s going on! What is this Stand back! – Yes sir! – Yes sir! You should be aware that this Senkaimon is used only by the princess or the inspectors B-But Sir Kenryu… The gate opened earlier and no one was there So she went back after all I’m sorry We can’t go to Soul Society through this gate There’s also a chance that Miss Kasumiohji will return here before you So we’ll keep a tight watch on this side Right Thanks I’m counting on you We’ll be off Let’s hurry She probably snuck in while the gatekeepers weren’t paying attention Yeah You guys painstakingly find refuge in the World of the Living and she comes right back All your troubles were for nothing Cripes… That’s what you get for being caretakers of a spoiled princess W-What was that for! Talk! To be blunt, it is not the place of a low-life like you to criticize the princess But it’s true that she’s spoiled What if she’s discovered by that guy named Kumoi, the very one who’s after her life You won’t get me a second time! What did you do that for! You’re at fault for carelessly saying the name of the enemy It’s her fault for wandering around carelessly! But, it stands that Lady Rurichiyo is still a young child It can’t be helped Let’s split up and search for her We will search inside the mansion Damn Where did Rurichiyo go She’ll get it when I find her Yo! Why are you in a hurry Long time no see! Captain Zaraki… and Lieutenant Kusajishi! What’re you doing here Oh That’s true Weren’t you in the World of the Living Uh… Um… Err… Is Ichigo here too Um…uh… So he’s here Yup, he’s here! And he’s pretty worked up about something Yup! He seems worked up N-No… That’s… He’s here and hasn’t come to greet me Oh well I’ll go to him then C-Captain Zaraki! This is bad This thing about Ririchiyo is a secret If I allow Ichigo and Captain Zaraki to meet, things can get out of hand She’s not on the castle grounds anymore What’s the matter, Enryu That’s… It belongs to the princess! The door closed by itself! Enryu, where are you! It’s too dark to see! Huh! What! Something just touched me! Stay there for a while Just until I get rid of the princess Princess, we have arrived Lady Rurichiyo Kasumiohji has arrived I thank you for your invitation today Thank you for coming so far You wait here Yes! That’s… Why you… You may leave us – Yes sir! – Yes sir! Ruricchi… Sacchi… – It’s been so long! – It’s been so long! Come on Everyone is already here! It really has been so long Yeah Everyone, Ruricchi is here! – Ruricchi, it’s been so long! – How have you been Fine And how have you all been Hey, Ruricchi… Okay! I’m so glad that you remembered How could I forget It is proof of our friendship There! Just a bit more, Enryu! Good! We’re almost there! We won’t let Kumoi have his way! Hey! We can get through! We did it, Enryu! We’ll be right there, Lady Rurichiyo! I think she went in here Who are you! Hey wait! I’m Substitute Soul Reaper, Ichigo Kurosaki! Rurichiyo went in there just a while ago, didn’t she Substitute Soul Reaper How dare you address Lady Rurichiyo so casually! You’re suspicious! W-Wait! I’m a Substitute Soul Reaper who was asked by Kenryu… You dare mention Sir Kenryu’s name too! I’ve never heard of a Substitute Soul Reaper! He disappeared! Where’d he go I guess “Substitute” Soul Reaper ain’t gonna work There he is! Above the wall! Oops! Ruricchi… This was made with the year’s first batch of tea leaves Thank you What the heck How filthy! I-Ichigo! What are you doing here That’s my line! Coming here on a whim… Come on, let’s go back Everyone’s waiting You shouldn’t have followed me here! This is an important tea ceremony! Rurichiyo, quit acting so spoiled Huh What’s this What’s going on! I beg your pardon, Princess A message was brought by a vassal of the Kasumiohji Clan that a robber had infiltrated the grounds W-Wait! I’m not a suspicious guy! Rurichiyo! I don’t know this man Ruricchi! Wait! Rurichiyo! Damn it! – He disappeared! – Where’d he go! Find him! That way! I’m in no mood to enjoy the tea ceremony now that Ichigo appeared What’s wrong Are you the child of one of the servants Did your mother scold you Now come Is there something over there What about this place Die! Ichigo! Rurichiyo! Are you all right! Rather… Who is she! Over there! There he is! Lady Rurichiyo is in danger! How dare you point your blade at a helpless child! No, wait! This is… Get him! Hold on, you see… Wait a minute! That kid is the… Princess Rurichiyo, are you hurt That’s wrong! Damn it! Kenpachi! So, Ichigo… You’re here, after all Yoo-hoo! Itchy! C-Captain Zaraki of Squad 11! Captain Zaraki! Ichigo… What are you doing Now then, Lady Rurichiyo, please get in Please don’t scold Rurichiyo Umm…I’m going to be wed shortly Oh, that’s great news No! She doesn’t even love him She’s being forced to marry someone she’s never met! It’s a marriage that was sealed between two noble families since they were children Don’t look like that I plan to accept it as part of my fate So this is my final tea ceremony Ruricchi knew that, so she went through great pains to come and see me Because we may never be able to meet again You must be marrying into a very strict family Yes Oh my… How strange It’s not as though I’m sad Sacchi… I guess aristocratic families have no freedom Without a doubt, it’s a totally different place from the World of the Living Captain Zaraki… Due to certain circumstances, we are working under secrecy May I ask you to keep this incident to yourself for now I don’t know what your reason is, and besides, I’m too busy to remember what’s what Kenny, you’re not too smart Thank you very much I was amused today Bring Ichigo back again I’ll wear him ragged Ragged, you know! Ragged See ya Jeez… We’re going back as well Yeah What’re you doing Yeah… He didn’t even quiver when he felt my Spiritual Pressure Seems like an interesting fellow That Kenpachi… I wonder if he’s really gonna keep the secret about us Don’t worry Kenny always says it’s too much of a bother and he never reports a thing Huh Then who’s been preparing the Squad 11 reports I dunno Is that okay! Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! What are you doing Baldy made this scooter for my birthday! Why are you in my mansion Because it’s so big! I guess its useless to tell her to stop Madam Chairman, it’s time for tea Oh, what’s the snack today The Madam Chairman has confetti candy Yay!"
" Trouble arises over succession rights in one of Soul Society’s high-ranking aristocratic families, the Kasumiohji Clan Their princess, Rurichiyo Kasumiohji, traveled to the World of the Living Ichigo reluctantly agrees to become her bodyguard Rurichiyo, who is unaware that her life is being targeted, turns Ichigo’s life upside down with her naive behavior One after another, Ichigo and his friends take down the assassins sent by Kumoi, the provisional administrator of the Kasumiohji Clan Frustrated by the string of missed opportunities in his plans, Kumoi comes up with something new Sir Kumoi… Why did you let Princess Rurichiyo return to the World of the Living I cannot be rash and attract the attention of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads Hanza Nukui, I am entrusting you with this sword Get rid of Rurichiyo and the rest in the World of the Living Along with everyone who gets in your way Now then… I shall proceed with my plans over here I’m so bored I wonder where Ruricchi has gone Master Kannogi Huh Yes Sir Kumoi wishes to see you Please come to the meeting room I said…move out of the way! Don’t block people’s way with your huge frame! This is my house, y’know! Oh, you’re wrong there, Lirin We are mere freeloaders here You’re flipping the logic here Shut up! Stop nitpicking on every little detail! Move! Now you’ve done it! Oh, but that was your doing! This poses a problem One more time! Oh! This is so much fun! Rurichiyo, you’re so good at that! That’s just beginner’s luck! It’s just chance! A coincidence! Oww! What’s the big idea! It is not chance! I am good at it! What! Are you looking for a fight! W-What I didn’t do a thing Yet… Jinta… Still… I am surprised that you all made it back safely You used the Kasumiohji Clan’s private Senkaimon for the return trip, did you not Yeah Just to be safe, we waited until dark before heading to the gate But it was surprisingly easy to return It was as if… they let us go on purpose More like… they did let you go on purpose It’s easier to settle affairs in the World of the Living That’s probably it Say, Mr Urahara What is this about goods running low I don’t know much in detail In any case, products are harder to get We’ve never run so low on supplies It seems there is a decline in the raw material itself Raw material I mean, reishi Of which, only one particular type is depleting drastically But when I went over there recently, there was no sign of that It’s all happening under the radar But it’s hard to believe something like this would happen naturally Then someone is doing this intentionally I checked many sources, but I couldn’t get that far However… However This phenomenon started the same time that princess appeared here You sure it’s not a coincidence No We can’t dismiss that The Kasumiohji Clan are high-ranking aristocrats second to the four great noble families, but I’ve heard that the family has other special circumstances I don’t know what that is, but the mayhem arising from the run on goods has never happened in Soul Society I can’t believe that they’re not connected in some way Kenryu, don’t you know anything Our duty is to protect Princess Rurichiyo We know nothing else! Don’t get so cocky! Cripes! You never act according to plan! At least stay well informed! Be silent! Now, now… Anyway, let’s just investigate a bit longer This incident seems to go deeper than I thought Lure them away from Princess Rurichiyo as planned Now then… Substitute Soul Reaper… Show me how good you are What’s this Spiritual Pressure Rukia! Inoue! Take Rurichiyo home Right What about you, Kurosaki I’m gonna check that out I’m coming with you All right! Chappy, watch Ichigo’s body Leave it to me, pyon! What did you just say I said Lord Shu Kannogi will become the head of the Kasumiohji Clan Would there be a problem with that I cannot agree to such a thing in the absence of Lady Rurichiyo! Agreed! Our Kasumiohji Clan has always had female sovereigns It is an ironclad law! A male cannot head our clan Lord Kannogi came to this clan as Lady Rurichiyo’s betrothed! Be it temporary, in Lady Rurichiyo’s absence, it is in the Kasumiohji Clan’s interest to ask him to be our lord But still… I am opposed! Me as well! The enemy’s Spiritual Pressure has spread throughout the town It must be a trap We’ll know when we fight them Let’s split up! Yeah His Spiritual Pressure… It’s the same as back then Oh You sensed it, after all Yeah… You’re the one who taunted me back in the Soul Society, aren’t you I am Hanza Nukui Now show me just how good a Substitute Soul Reaper is Again Yes Why is my life being targeted It is too complex to explain! In any case, we will protect you, no matter what! That is no explanation! Tell me everything! Another time! No! What’s wrong You… That sword… Oh… You noticed it It’s the same one as that other time The Zanpakuto and its wielder are one in body and mind! Why do you have that! You don’t need…to know! What’s the matter Is that all! That last guy was way stronger! I guess I can’t win like this What! Trap them… Saiga! Such a small repertoire I’ve seen that attack already! Now, it’s my turn! Not again! What the hell! This is different from what the small fry use You can’t defend yourself from my attack just by looking away from the light What will we do Sir Kumoi is pushing his way through everything The order of the Kasumiohji Clan will be totally disrupted! We must object, at all cost – What is this! – Identify yourselves! They are faster than I had thought This is a bad spot I must get out into the open Santenkesshun! Kotenzanshun! Now’s your chance! Thank you! Let’s go, Inoue! Right! What is this place My body… It’s useless Your consciousness is here, yet it’s not here What As long as you are locked up in the world of mirrors, you will not be able to move an inch It’s totally different from the time you last faced this sword What do you mean! This sword acts by consuming its wielder’s spiritual power In other words, the higher the spiritual power, the greater the power it can draw Depending on its wielder! If this sword consumes spiritual power, only someone who can endure it is able to manifest its true power Someone like me! Now then, let us not waste time I shall kill you in one breath As if I’ll let you… have your way! What! A crack in Saiga! What is this Spiritual Pressure! Why you… Don’t get too cocky! Damn… Move… Move! It’s useless! What’s wrong with me! Move! Yoruichi! Yoruichi! It seems ordinary methods won’t work on him Yeah I owe you Oh You still want to continue Check it out carefully The Spiritual Pressure of your subordinates What! This is the end Impossible! Did you think you could bring us down with that level of troops Hold it, you! Ichigo! Kuchiki! Damn it Shihoin Yoruichi… I didn’t expect someone like her to be there And also… Ichigo Kurosaki His Spiritual Pressure is… So it won’t be that easy Well then… Now, we will proceed with the installation of the 18th Lord of the Kasumiohji Clan Lord Shu Kannogi, my complements on your installation Do you suppose they will come again I’ll take them on next time! But I’m told that our new gigai arent ready yet! What! And I wanted to show off my sexy appearance! There’s no such thing ARRANCAR ENCYCLOPEDIA Arrancar Encyclopedia I’m going to talk about Fracciónes today We are able to select 	personal subordinates FRACCIÓNES from Arrancars numbered 11 and under They are called Fracciónes Some choose one, others more – Master Szayelaporro! – And mine are quite special You can eat them and they have a rehabilitating effect See Hey, hey, you shouldn’t take over someone’s segment! Would you like one I can’t handle raw food"
" Kumoi’s plot to assassinate Rurichiyo is set into motion He gives his trusted retainer Hanza Nukui the Bakkouto, Saiga, and sends his assassination squad to the World of the Living to carry out the mission Nukui forces Ichigo and his friends to split up, then challenges them individually Trap them… Saiga! Such a small repertoire I’ve seen that attack already! Now, it’s my turn! Not again! What the hell! This is different from what the small fry use You can’t defend yourself from my attack just by looking away from the light Saiga, the sword Nukui uses to battle Ichigo, is the same sword that a previous assassin wielded But it displays different powers than before The Bakkouto is a blade that’s able to transform its powers depending on the wielder As if I’ll let you have your way! What! A crack in Saiga! However, Nukui and his men, having underestimated the strength that Ichigo and the others possessed, are defeated So it won’t be that easy Well then… Kumoi… What is it Lord Kannogi, how are you faring Yes, all is well Or, should I say… I don’t know what I’m supposed to be doing I’m just whiling the time away That is fine You can leave the Kasumiohji Clan matters to me Now excuse me Huh That’s all I feel like I’m being watched Jeez, I’m so bored! And Ruricchi still hasn’t come back Is it really all right like this Thank goodness Lord Kannogi is a very ordinary youth How shameless of you to return here Pardon me No matter It seems the Substitute Soul Reaper’s power was far greater than we surmised And What will you do If I may be given another opportunity, I will give my life to be rid of the Substitute Soul Reaper and the princess Then show me your resolve Yes, my lord! This fusion with your sword, which exceeds all limits… Do you understand what it means, Hanza I am fully aware of what I did Your resolve… I, Gyokaku Kumoi, have personally witnessed it Fulfill your mission and bring me the heads of the Substitute Soul Reaper and the princess! Yes, my lord! If I may make a request… What is it I wish to borrow swords for my men Jinnai Douko I am Kuzuryu I am known as Genga And these men are… Yes, my lord! They are, without exception, the finest men in the underworld You men… This sword sucks the life out of its user Knowing this, do you still have the nerve to use it Absolutely Is there a reason why we should hesitate We are confident that we have what it takes to wield that sword Fine All I seek are results I made the barrier stronger I’ve also put up an optic barrier so that the house isn’t visible from the outside Not visible You mean, it looks like this is an empty lot Huh! Rurichiyo’s house is gone! When did it disappear! Isn’t that going too far Nothing is too far when one is protecting the princess! I’m just saying, what’ll happen if this causes a panic later It can’t be helped After all, we don’t even know the extent of their power A Zanpakuto that evolves by feeding on the wielder’s Spiritual Pressure, huh Yoruichi has gone back to Soul Society to gather information I hope she learns something useful Princess, what is the matter Oh yes! There are some delicious sweets here Kenryu, Enryu, and even Ichigo and his friends Why such tight security around me No… It’s… It seems the World of the Living has far more night thieves than we thought I am very, very sorry for causing you to worry Yes… I see I am going to bed Good night! I’ve been so busy lately Now all the housework has piled up! This incident seems to go deeper than I thought It looks like… things are getting messy again Weren’t you going to sleep Ichigo… What’re you doing I am just gazing at the stars So you can make those expressions What kind of expression How can I put it It’s as though you’re breathing Breathing Really What’s so funny You make it sound like I do not usually breathe I see I guess that didn’t sound right The World of the Living is nice Even if I climb on the roof, no one scolds me That’s ‘cuz you’re a princess and no one wants you to get hurt You are right If I get hurt, someone will be punished I can’t even get hurt I always have so much I want to do But each time, someone suffers because of me Even when I tried to learn archery… What if something happened to the princess! – We are very sorry, please forgive us! – Because of me, the archery attendant and my maid were punished, and the boar was hunted down Because I left the mansion unseen, the gatekeeper was relieved of his duties I didn’t notice when I was little, but so many have been punished because of me If I had known that sooner, I would have behaved more But I didn’t know Isn’t it shameful It’s hard when you don’t get scolded, but others do Still Kenryu and Enryu often  look the other way and cover up for me And so, this means that flower may bloom, but they eventually fall off And next… Huh Such skill! Oh! Oh! Oh! Kenryu, buy the whole store Not possible! Buy it! Buy it! Buy it! Buy it! I want it, no matter what! I want it! I want it! Oh What are you going in such a place Oh, it’s nothing! Excuse us! It’s delicious! Found you, Enryu! I am grateful to both of them However… What is it It’s nothing This Spiritual Pressure… Is it them I shall get my revenge for last time… Substitute Soul Reaper! What is the matter Let’s go back Did something happen It’s nothing serious But don’t move around If you were invited to a friend’s tea party, sorry, but cancel it for today Lady Rurichiyo! Kenryu… Please do not leave my side It’s all right You’ve got all of us here with you I shall get the Substitute Soul Reaper’s head You get his friends Do you have to get personally involved Shouldn’t you leave the Substitute Soul Reaper to us and go after the princess No… He owes me for the crack in Saiga’s mirror during our last battle In any case, his Spiritual Pressure is something only I can handle Fine I think the others will amuse us quite sufficiently Don’t get too cocky, Genga They’ll be easy, Bro Several of them are on the move Are they luring us Interesting Let them lure us Let’s go, Genga I’m with you, Bro! We’ll go too Rukia! Ishida and Sado went on ahead! They’re going to ambush them Yes It seems they’ve followed our lead and separated too They must be quite confident Yeah And they probably have those swords too A barrier They thought they could fool us with this Lady Rurichiyo! The barrier has been broken! Ichigo! Right! Rukia, stay with Rurichiyo and these two All right Ichigo… Lady Rurichiyo, please do not leave my side! But… No buts! You stay with Kenryu Got that So here you are, Substitute Soul Reaper! You saved me the trouble of looking for you You… Princess! Ichigo! Don’t come out! No, Princess! Let me go, Kenryu! No, get inside Hurry! I said let me go! What’s going on I thought you were after Rurichiyo Ichigo! Stay back, Rukia For some reason, this guy wants to challenge me Ichigo! It’s dangerous! Please stay indoors! There’s no guarantee that it’s still safe inside! You are right, however… If anything should happen to Ichigo Kurosaki, their next target will be… They’ll come after me next Oh…well… In other words, these are the night thieves who have come to the World of the Living after me! Y-Yes, they are Let’s change locations Fine Let’s go! Kurosaki! Ishida and Sado too Ichigo… Who’s there! You are Rurichiyo Kasumiohji You’re a friend of the Substitute Soul Reaper, aren’t you You reek with the smell of blood Here I come, Ichigo Kurosaki! Bankai! They forced their way through, after all Don’t worry I had lots of time to change into my Quincy outfit You don’t look that different It’s really different To be specific… It’s gonna take too long, so don’t bother ARRANCAR ENCYCLOPEDIA Arrancar Encyclopedia Today’s topic is Las Noches LAS NOCHES This is our base of operations  in Hueco Mundo I’ve told the Espada to stay put in their own palaces, but I guess some sneak around outside Oh When I think about all the traps placed inside my palace, I can’t dare go out Shall I show them to you sometime Its probably all nasty stuff"
" Kumoi, the provisional administrator of the Kasumiohji Clan, is after Rurichiyo’s life He gives his follower Hanza, the leader of the assassination squad, the Bakkouto and sends him off Nukui overcomes his limits to merge with the Bakkouto and he leads new assassins who possess powerful Spiritual Pressure in a new attack against Ichigo and his friends So here you are, Substitute Soul Reaper! Ichigo! Stay back, Rukia For some reason, this guy wants to challenge me Let’s change locations Fine Let’s go! You’re a friend of the Substitute Soul Reaper, aren’t you Ichigo… Who’s there! You are Rurichiyo Kasumiohji You… Are you with that attacker from earlier Hand over Rurichiyo Kasumiohji What is this ominous Spiritual Pressure And his appearance… Is this foe different from the others What’s the matter I refuse! What I said I refuse! Dance Sodenoshirayuki! Somenomai Tsukishiro! Miss Kuchiki! I went easy on him He’s not dead, but he can’t move He is a valuable witness If we use him, the truth of the plot… I wonder about that What! Was that the power of the Zanpakuto which is said to be the most beautiful in Soul Society You’re… Well then, proper etiquette requires me to show you my power! The power of this Bakkouto, Retsurai Bakkouto W-What is this! Amazing… I feel power overflowing! Here I come! Take that! Miss Kuchiki! Is it over Do you want to end up like that Be silent! Bloom in glory… Benishidare! Now’s your chance! Kenryu! Such a childish trick! Damn it! You can’t get away Hado 33: Sokatsui! Miss Kuchiki! I am your opponent! Just what I’d expect from a Soul Reaper of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads You know Looks like youre going to make this fun! I, Jinnai Douko, find you worthy to be my opponent! W-What the… Amazing! I can feel the power building inside me! This is the power of the Bakkouto! You’re a human, but you are able to use the Flash Step It’s not the Flash Step It’s called Hirenkyaku Hirenkyaku Yes A Quincy technique I see So you are the rumored last Quincy You’re aware of that Well, yes Tell me your name, Quincy Uryu Ishida And you I am Kuzuryu What’s the matter Well… Just that it’s an unusual Zanpakuto That appearance… Am I correct to assume that it’s in a Shikai state What’s so funny This sword is not a Zanpakuto It is a Bakkouto How different is that from a Soul Reaper’s Zanpakuto Everything about it is different Bakkouto do not have concepts like Shikai and Bankai This encompasses its appearance And depending on the wielder’s Spiritual Pressure, it can unleash enormous power Isn’t that exactly what the Zanpakuto does No A Soul Reaper and his Zanpakuto enhance each other and mutually increase power But this sword takes its wielder’s Spiritual Pressure and nothing else, and transforms it into power! I see But I find it hard to believe that it’s stronger than a Zanpakuto Bend! What! Did I get him What is this Spiritual Pressure What’s with that appearance This is the true form of my Shiragiri What! Arrows of reishi won’t work on me Why you… Shiragiri, Mugen Kairou! This is… There! What! Over here An illusion Where is he Which is the real body It’s useless looking for Spiritual Pressure You cannot discern my form There! I said it’s useless Strange There’s no way this location is so huge Is my perception off Or… How long can you keep running Kurosaki… Kuchiki… Ishida… I can feel all their Spiritual Pressures I must hurry! Sado! How far do you intend to run before you’re satisfied I have no intention of running I just don’t like fighting in town Oh Listen, I’m sorry but can you forget fighting and leave What! I know nothing about the nobility in Soul Society But even I know that nobles have a certain responsibility regarding the power that they’ve been entrusted with Just like Byakuya Kuchiki Just what is it you want to say Rurichiyo is still young But I believe she is prepared to take on her role as an aristocrat When the time comes, Rurichiyo will return to Soul Society with Kenryu and Enryu In order to confront her destiny and forge her own path So When that time comes, she will have to settle things whether she wants to or not I want you to leave her alone until then What’s so funny I wondered what you were gonna say Impossible! Then, I’ll force you to leave! Save your words until after you’ve fought with me on equal terms! Smash, Kakuyoku! This is… It’s the same Zanpakuto as the assassin Ichigo defeated What’s going on It’s not the same! This is its true power! This is the Bakkouto, Kakuyoku! Last time, the small fry could barely make a wall But it’s different with my Spiritual Pressure! So you can use it even if the wielder changes Exactly! Hey, hey, hey! Don’t think you can dodge this forever! Prepare to die! Oh Not even close Huh It seems your big body isn’t just for show You seem to be pretty tough Then… It’s useless, useless, useless! What! Brazo Derecho Del Gigante Is that your true strength Your attacks won’t work anymore Interesting! Then I’ll use all my strength to destroy you! What’s the matter Are you done That’s my line You’re breathing awfully hard Doesn’t bother me Don’t think you can resist forever! Too slow! You really are one tough fellow! That technique of yours… It eats away your life each time you use it I’m amazed by your toughness, but how long do you think you can keep up that attack I could ask the same of you That sword is exhausting your Spiritual Pressure At that rate… your sword will consume you My Spiritual Pressure is limitless This is nothing! I’ll show you… the true power of my Kakuyoku! Do you think you’ve shut off any escape by creating a wall There’s no sign…of his presence You’re mine! Kuchiki, I heard an enemy that can eat swords came to you The enemy who appeared before me can create mist My opponent can create walls I get it! So they build stages, then create smoke for effects, and do a magic show! Inoue, I think you’ve got it wrong ARRANCAR ENCYCLOPEDIA Arrancar Encyclopedia Today, let’s talk about Yasutora Sado’s technique THE RIGHT ARM OF THE GIANT His right arm has 	enormous defensive power THE RIGHT ARM OF THE GIANT BRAZO DERECHO DEL GIGANTE known as 	Brazo Derecho Del Gigante His left arm has 	attack power THE LEFT ARM OF THE DEVIL THE LEFT ARM OF THE DEVIL BRAZO IZQUIERO DEL DIABLO known as 	Brazo Izquierdo Del Diablo You can’t understand its meaning without seeing the word Why am I featured in this corner You said so yourself Your power is close to a Hollow’s That’s true HOLLOW But I have really 	mixed feelings about it"
" Gyokaku Kumoi, having grown impatient with the failed attempts to assassinate Rurichiyo, gives his retainer Hanza Nukui and his men strange swords known as the Bakkouto, and dispatches them to the World of the Living Here I come, Ichigo Kurosaki! Bankai! Rukia battles one of the assassins, Douko, and is hurt by the ominous Bakkouto, Retsurai Kenryu and Enryu come to her aid and she manages to release her Kido and continues to hold her own Amazing! I can feel the power building inside me! This is the power of the Bakkouto! Meanwhile, Ishida battles Kuzuryu and is locked in a corridor of mist created by the Bakkouto, Shiragiri Shiragiri, Mugen Kairou! This is… There! What! Over here An illusion How long can you keep running And finally, Sado is also caught up in a fierce battle against Genga and his Bakkouto, Kakuyoku I’ll show you… the true power of my Kakuyoku! There’s no sign… of his presence You’re mine! He is much faster than I thought I must stop his moves What! The finishing blow! What! Prepare to die! Don’t think that’s the extent of the power of this Bakkouto, Retsurai! What! What Is it over already Miss Kuchiki! Kenryu! You must help Miss Kuchiki! Right! You fool Lady Rurichiyo! Take this! What! Take Lady Rurichiyo! You’re in my way! Kenryu! Enryu! Damn it! Not only his speed… I must immobilize the blades on his back, or there’s no chance of victory That’s it! Hado Number 33: Sokatsui! Damn! Sokatsui! Sokatsui! Sokatsui! Sokatsui! Sokatsui! Why you… You squirming little… Well then… Die! Somenomai… Tsukishiro! What! Why you… Now! Bakudo Number 4: Hainawa! What! Bakudo Number 1: Sai! You think you’re so clever Tsuginomai Hakuren! I did it Take Lady Rurichiyo! I won’t forgive you I won’t forgive you! What is this! What! Stop! Stop! What…What happened just now What’s going on! His Spiritual Pressure is scattered throughout and I can’t sense his presence What is that sword Seeleschneider The only bladed Quincy weapon I never heard that Quincies use swords Perhaps we use other weapons you’re not aware of Don’t kid around Strange… This mist is created with reishi So why is the convergence of reishi weakening Then… All right What’s going on Even if he’s using the Flash Step, his speed is too fast Also, that blade… I used my Seeleschneider on it, but there’s not even a knick Did he repair it with the reishi in this mist No, because then I could accumulate reishi easily too It can’t be… Has he actually combined with the mist! So that’s it Yes, it seems you figured it out This mist is my body But with that leg, you can no longer use the Hirenkyaku You cannot escape my Shiragiri, Mugen Kairou I wondered what you would do It’s useless You seem to be waiting for the moment that I materialize physically… but it’s useless Now, how long can you hold out I figured that would be your move! Wha— W-What is this! Sprenger It is a Quincy Zeichen I drew with my Seeleschneider When did you… It’s all thanks to you What! I purposely created openings in five directions And because you attacked each opening, I was able to set up the barrier Not yet Not with something like this! As if I’ll let you get away! What are you doing! It’s over now! Impossible! Do you intend to blow yourself up! You’ll be caught up in it too! You’re the one who’s getting hit by the attack directly! Damn it Lady Rurichiyo, are you hurt I am fine But Enryu… Enryu! Please rest assured Enryu is quite sturdy It must’ve been painful for you too, Kenryu We must tend to your wounds The sword used by that assassin He called it a Bakkouto Wha—! You! Hold it! Just what are those swords He appeared from within the wall! This is the power of my Bakkouto, Kakuyoku! Crap! What’s the matter You can’t just keep running away! Then… I just have to break the wall! Too naïve! Hey, hey, hey, hey! You can’t break the wall unless you turn your back towards me! Not necessarily Damn it! What is this brute strength! Well, your act of desperation won’t work a second time! That’s fine I won’t let you go inside the wall again Ridiculous! What! You want to crush me before I go into the wall Interesting Let’s see you try! Just how much tougher can you get You too What’s so funny Nothing I never imagined that a man like you existed in the World of the Living I came to Nukui wanting this sword And not only do I possess this sword, but I have found an opponent that I can test its power on to its limit! How can I not laugh! Forget it! That sword is sucking the life out of you I’m well aware of that! I only want to know the extent of my power! This is the final attack! Fine I will garner all my strength to counter you Brazo Izquierdo Del Diablo So you still had a hidden power Forgive me That’s all right Try it if you can! Kakuyoku! Give me strength! La Muerte! Sado! Chad too! You! That Spiritual Pressure belongs to your friend and mine! What of it You jerk! On the battlefield, the one who loses his temper dies Shut up! Oh You display fine swordsmanship I know your moves! Wha—! I told you before I never fall for the same move twice! That Zanpakuto derives its attack from reflected light So if I shatter that, it’s all over! I wonder about that What! I told you, depending on the Spiritual Pressure of its wielder, this sword can get infinitely stronger Miss Kuchiki, are you hurt I’m fine But the house is in tatters That’s why we have quick and efficient insurance for whatever happens to the house Where did you get this insurance Urahara’s Shop I wonder about that Complete Quincy Today’s segment is about the application of the Seeleschneider SPRENGER This is called Sprenger Seeleschneider is used to create a formation in the ground Then reishi is activated to set off an explosion It is powerful, but due to  the time it takes to form, it is wise to have the aid of comrades Relying on others again, eh My hand slipped I swear you’re doing that on purpose!"
" Gyokaku Kumoi has grown impatient with the failed attempts to assassinate Rurichiyo He bestows his veteran assassin and his squad members with powerful swords known as the Bakkouto, forged through the Kasumiohji Clan’s hidden art, and dispatches them to the World of the Living Ichigo battles Hanza Nukui, the leader of the assassin squad Using the knowledge gained from their previous fight, Ichigo targets the Bakkouto Saiga’s weakness Instead, he finds himself trapped inside a world of mirrors I know your moves!

I won’t take orders from you! You… Why fight that hard For the sake of the Kasumiohji Clan… and for my sake Since ancient times, the Kasumiohji Clan has been a distinguished clan, proudly providing swords to the royal family We too have historically existed alongside them as their shadows Hey! Who are you people! And at times… We would even deceive the Thirteen Court Guard Squads themselves to keep the hidden art behind our sword making technique safe Even if it were forbidden… It was all to protect the Kasumiohji Clan That has been our reason for existence Amongst them, I have fought many bitter battles and survived And finally… I acquired this power! A power only the chosen few are granted! You’re saying you are the chosen one That’s right! Then you… How dare you! If your purpose in being is to protect the Kasumiohji Clan… Why did you attack Rurichiyo! Because the weak have no right to carry on the Kasumiohji legacy! Just for that Rurichiyo is… frightened…shaking… Even when she’s smiling, she’s afraid She…just wants to be free The princess of the Kasumiohji Clan has no freedom! That’s…not something for you to decide! What do you know! So that’s…your…true…power! Interesting! Why you… Getsugatensho! Not yet! I won’t lose! I’m not going to lose here! Saiga! Stop it already! You’re not the chosen one! What are you talking about!

"  Shusuke Amagai, originally from the Expedition Unit, is appointed as the new captain of Squad 3 In spite of possessing awesome power, Amagai is a humble man, choosing to fight together with his squad members Supporting his method, the squad members gradually gain momentum One day Kira discovers an unexpected side to the mild-mannered and trusted Makoto Kibune Seeing this, Kira comes to feel a strange discomfort towards Kibune I knew of its existence, but this is the first time I’ve ever entered this place Me too Well, people don’t use fighting arenas anymore But since we have access to it, Mr Kibune felt we could use it for our training drill Sorry were late Huh Where’s Captain Amagai Oh, about the captain… Can I have a moment of your time What is it, Amagai Here on the Captains’ Council, I’m the youngest member and it may be deemed inappropriate, but I would like to express my opinion Speak Sir! It was just after I had been appointed as the captain of Squad 3… A request for a Restrictive Current shutdown was submitted to the Department of Research and Development in order to battle the Menos in the Precipice World Yet, the Restrictive Current still occurred Our squad faced the danger of being consumed by the Restrictive Current Fortunately, my squad members survived What is this all about Excuse me If you have a complaint, express it elsewhere! I don’t have time to listen to the problems of another squad, nor am I interested! Yes! That is what I would like to express my opinion on! What The Thirteen Court Guard Squads are comprised of independent squads each with their own unique qualities I understand that But, from an organizational point of view, there is no interaction between members and the cooperative spirit is weak Am I wrong to say this Precipice World incident has exposed the Thirteen Court Guard Squads’ weakness So, what You want us to get all friendly and fight together joining hand in hand I wouldn’t go that far I think we should at least conduct joint training exercises No way! I’m not interested in taking part in such games! Don’t make me laugh! No… It may not be a laughing matter What! When you think about it… Aizen, Ichimaru, Tosen… All three of these rebels probably took advantage of the gaps and misunderstandings between us To strengthen and unify our squads… What Captain Amagai is suggesting makes sense to me Don’t be discouraged, Amagai You expressed your opinion well But… I was hoping to get a commitment to joint training As a man… It is truly regrettable! He hasn’t drunk much, has he No, he hasn’t Then, why Just the smell of alcohol seems to have made him drunk Don’t rush, Amagai It’s got great potential Huh! Really Yeah… It may seem daunting, but most of the members understood what you were proposing Plus, Ukitake nicely elaborated on the topic Captain Ukitake… I owe you! – H-Hey! – Hey, hey… W-Wait, Amagai! Yes, yes, I’m all right I see… Now I’m even more motivated I will work on our next strategy right away! Cheers! Oh my… What do you think About him Yeah I like him and his recklessness Yeah… That’s why… Huh What That’s why I get the feeling he’ll become isolated from the other captains Joint training! Yeah That new Squad 3 Captain suggested it Huh I personally don’t think it’s necessary Joint training, huh -It will be a pleasure to work with you! -It will be a pleasure to work with you! It might be surprisingly fun doing it together I don’t think so Come on! You won’t know until you try! I do know! It sounds fun though! It looks like Ukitake and Kyoraku are lending a lot of support to Amagai I hope it doesn’t create a strain between him and those opposing him Unfortunately, I’m told the joint training exercises were rejected We in Squad 3 are the only ones doing those coordination exercises It was our chance to show the other squads what we could do Looks like we’re back to doing miscellaneous chores The other day, I had to clean Squad 7’s toilets That’s nothing I’m Squad 11’s errand boy They complain about me being thirty seconds late and things like that Well, at least it’s not as bad as Squad 4 You’re right Compared to the miscellaneous  team of Squad 4… Huh! Don’t tell me… Squad 4 made me do laundry! – Huh! – Huh! What’s going to happen to us! There’s no reason to be so pessimistic The captains of Squads 8 and 13 agreed to support Captain Amagai’s suggestion The Captains’ Council decision may soon be reversed Oh! That’s reassuring! I’m glad to hear that It appears you lack the will as well What is it Lieutenant Kira… Is there something on my face Uh… No… Actually… Third Seat Kibune, I saw you entering the Kasumiohji house Huh Me Really, Third Seat Kibune! It couldn’t be! There’s no way I could have entered such a place You’ve mistaken me for someone else Huh! But… Besides, why would an average Soul Reaper like me have contact with such an aristocratic family That’s true! Don’t surprise us like that! Was I mistaken! No, I’m sure of it Urgent message! Urgent message! Menos have been detected entering the Seireitei! Squads, go to your guard posts and prepare to intercept! Menos! I repeat! Menos have been detected entering the Seireitei! That…can’t be! Squads, prepare to intercept! What’s going on What’ll we do! Uh… What do you mean Isn’t it obvious! Let’s attack, sir! We can’t afford to fall behind the other squads! But…the captain… This is our chance to show our strength! Right, Mr Kibune! Okay! Let’s go! – Yeah! – Yeah! No! Let’s wait for the captain! But… Moving out aimlessly would be meaningless Let’s wait until Captain Amagai returns No… If we’ve trained, we can move even without the captain Or is there some reason Are you going to ignore the enthusiasm of your squad members and not move until the captain gives  orders, Lieutenant Kira That’s not the point I’m saying we shouldn’t move needlessly until we  get more information! Is that so Don’t you think we can do it Third Seat Kibune is right! We can do it! – He’s right! – Let’s attack! – Let’s go! – Lieutenant Kira! – Lets attack! – Lieutenant! It can’t be helped! Third Seat Kibune, please take charge! What! That’s right! I’ll follow your lead! – Me, too! – Me, too! – Me, too! – Me, too! This is what the members are saying Do you still intend to say no Uh… But… It appears you have no intention of acting As it stands, I will have to lead then Let’s go, everyone! – Yes, sir! – Yes, sir! You guys! Don’t let anyone get past us! We, Squad 11, will be getting the prey Huh Why did you suddenly appear, Iba! That’s what I was going to say! We’re in a hurry! So are we! Stop being so persistent! Same to you! We have business to deal with over there! We’re the ones who have business! For now, go to your guard posts But, don’t overextend yourself It’s odd to not have received any eye witness information yet And you captain I’ll leave you in charge of this area Captain! Lieutenant! NON-SQUAD 12 MEMBERS KEEP OUT Wait a minute What’s this! It’s unusual for Menos to enter the Seireitei! Please stay out of our way as we capture it! Huh Squad Alert! Menos have been detected in the northeast area of the Seireitei! Move in that direction! I repeat! Menos have been detected in Did you hear that Northeast! the northeast area of the Seireitei Let’s go! Don’t fall behind! Move in that direction! According to the messenger, they should be around here It doesn’t feel like there are Menos around here at all Third Seat Kibune! I really think we should pull back at once We don’t have visuals of the target, and besides that, we don’t know what kind of special properties it may possess Lieutenant Kira! We’ve come this far, what are you saying! That’s right! If we take them down, Squad 3 will be recognized! But… Lieutenant Kira, I think you should refrain from saying anything that might confuse your squad members Besides, I thought you were against attacking What are you doing here You… As reported, as of now there are conflicts occurring between squads in several locations I understand, thank you Captain What do you think, Nanao Well, something seems to be wrong There’s no enemy in sight, yet there’s tension in the air You are right Well Shall we go home What are you talking about! Menos have entered the vicinity! Menos Are they really there Huh! You think so too – Huh! – Huh! Are you saying it is all a ruse! There’s a high probability Why is that We only have information but no confirmed sighting Besides, the only thing I can feel is the Spiritual Pressure from each of the squads I think somebody played a trick on us – Oh… – Oh… – As expected of our captain! – As expected of our captain! Hey, that was my line, Kotsubaki! Don’t steal it! Shut up! You were copying me! I’m not copying you! You numbskull! What was that! In any case, someone sounded an alarm As well as provided false information Everyone, including captains, lieutenants and a lot of Soul Reapers believed it and took action This proves how easy it is to draw the Thirteen Court Guard Squads into confusion against an enemy that does not exist The question is… who was behind this It was I Genryusai Sensei! So, what do you suggest we do, Lieutenant Withhold our attack! But if you insist on going… What a strange person Very well Let’s go at it Stop! Sorry, everyone I left you all behind Captain, where were you I was done in by alcohol and fell asleep Again! This guy is… Never mind that, Kibune Yes Even if the troops give their approval, when I’m not here, Kira should give the orders Don’t overstep your boundaries I’m sorry Captain Amagai… Sorry, Kira If only I could handle liquor better Next time, be more confident and take the lead Yes, sir What’s wrong There it is! Here! Let’s go, you guys! Squad 11 is the first to go! I don’t think so! We’re the ones who are ready to go! Hurry! We can’t let our prey get killed before we catch it! Come on! What’s going on! What’s going on It’s a dead end! What’ll we do! Those five Menos… I created them myself using the Tenshintai to see how each squad would react to the spread of false information Until now, everything was going as expected All that’s left is to see what Amagai does amidst this chaos Don’t panic! Do as you were trained and there won’t be any problems! – Y-Yes, sir! – Y-Yes, sir! Tell the other squads how we usually move! I’ll give the order! – Understood! – Understood! Sorry, everyone! From here on, do as Squad 3 asks you to! Squad 7 fall back! Iba! Madarame, Squad 7 is pulling back You do the same! Why! Just pull back! It can’t be helped Squad 11, fall back for now! Okay, Aida! Have Squad 6 move to the right! Yes, sir! Please do so! All right! Next! Kano! Squad 10 to the left! Yes, sir! Okay, Kira! Squad 11 to the center! Yes, sir! Now! I know! Roar Zabimaru! Next! Inose! Squad 7 to the back right! As you can see, the five dummy Menos were destroyed with quick formations following orders from Squad 3 I see I approve the Thirteen Court Guard Squads joint training Boy! That felt great! Indeed! From now on Squad 3 won’t be treated so poorly! You know With Captain Amagai, Squad 3 is in good hands! That’s for sure! Right, Captain Well…now that I feel relieved, the alcohol is rushing in again Kenryu, we have not been going to school lately Is it okay for us not to commute every day It’s okay Ichigo Kurosaki and the others have also been with us this whole time, and they are fine as well, are they not Actually, it’s not fine Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers No!

" Ichigo agrees to become the bodyguard for Princess Rurichiyo of the Kasumiohji Clan, a high ranking noble family And now he must battle  the assassins sent by Gyokaku Kumoi, who  plots to take over Kumoi gives the assassins the Bakkouto, which are made through secret Kasumiohji techniques, and they attack Ichigo and his comrades with their special powers In the face of their powerful Bakkouto, one assassins Spiritual Pressure is completely exhausted, another is unable to unleash its full power, and they are all ultimately defeated Oh, Lord Kannogi That certainly becomes you Tell me… Is Ruricchi really coming I don’t want to go through the wedding ceremony alone Please do not worry Princess Rurichiyo will most certainly return before the ceremony Really You seem confident about that I am So do not worry Wedding ceremony! Yes… The wedding preparations are continuing in the Kasumiohji Clan for Rurichiyo and Shu Kannogi Who is this Kannogi Sir Shu is Lady Rurichiyo’s fiancé Fiancé She has someone like that That’s the aristocracy for you There is talk that Shu Kannogi has already been installed as the head of the Kasumiohji Clan So now, they’ll rush through the ceremony and make it official But Rurichiyo is with us How can they get married A stand-in, perhaps After all, most people won’t know the difference Prominent nobles of Soul Society will receive invitations On the day of the marriage, the gates of the Kasumiohji  Clan will open, so that the common people can get a glimpse of the bride They’re taking all the steps necessary to thwart our actions! That Kumoi… He resorted to such dirty tactics! When is the ceremony scheduled The day after tomorrow So there’s a little time Which means he may try to lure us into a trap and take Princess Rurichiyo back That’s a possibility He’s controlling the situation and minimizing the actions we can take, driving us into a corner We can’t make any move freely Inoue is doing her best with Ishida and Sado, but the enemy’s evil  Spiritual Pressure lingers around the wound openings It’s taking time for her to reject it This sword… Did you say it was called a Bakkouto Yeah It’s a sword that  eats up the wielder’s Spirit Energy and converts it to power Kisuke… You aren’t familiar with it either I hope you don’t think I know everything What is it, Enryu No… Lady Rurichiyo isn’t here How can you tell from just that Lady Rurichiyo So here you are Don’t worry Let’s leave it to Orihime Inoue They will recover fully Now… We must not get in the way Let us leave Lady Rurichiyo It’s all right, Rurichiyo I know! Rurichiyo, can you help me wring out the towels Huh All right Please Please use this Thank you, Rurichiyo I am sorry Huh I am so helpless That’s not true! This wasn’t your fault, Rurichiyo! So here you are They say something and smoke like high places You were on the roof the last time too I had forgotten Ishida and Chad didn’t get hurt because of you Don’t worry You are wrong No, I’m not You are wrong! If I were not here, they would not -have gone through such suffering -You’re wrong! They didn’t come after you After all, that Nukui guy came to fight me personally I know Huh Even I know that they were not bandits! Kumoi sent them! Kumoi wants to take over the Kasumiohji Clan, and he wants me dead! Rurichiyo, you… I have known that Kumoi was after me for a long time I also know that you all kept quiet so that I would not worry I am very grateful for that But… But… Rurichiyo… We all made the decision on our own and chose to protect you None of us could ignore your dilemma Besides, I’m a Substitute Soul Reaper! It’s part of my job  to keep people like you from wandering around Ichigo… So don’t cry! I am not crying! We’ll be all right Ishida and Chad may take  more time to recover, but Inoue will do something So don’t worry Thank you, Ichigo Huh Hey! What’re you doing! Forgive me Unlock! Oww… Rurichiyo! I am grateful for your effort However, I cannot trouble you all any further! I will take action myself and take back the Kasumiohji Clan! Rurichiyo! What’s wrong, Ichigo! What happened! Oh! Lady Rurichiyo! What’s the meaning of this, Ichigo Kurosaki! I’ll explain later! We’re going after her! What’re you doing! Hurry and open the Senkaimon! I know that! Unlock! Huh! What! What’s the matter The gate won’t open What does that mean Lady Rurichiyo has locked it from the other side I’m sure of it Isn’t there a way to open it! Without a key, it’s useless! Damn it! Ichigo! Think about the situation If you use that gate, you’ll only fall into the enemy’s trap! Then what do you expect us to do! Calm down, Ichigo! Why did Princess Rurichiyo decide to return to her clan She knew that Kumoi was targeting her What! And she blamed herself for everything that’s happened Oh no! So that’s it, huh But what does she plan to do by returning all on her own Could it be! She intends to subdue Kumoi by proceeding with the marriage and taking over as the head of the clan! They’re not that naïve! Rukia! Open your Senkaimon! Right! Unlock! Kurosaki! Be careful Inoue, look after Ishida and Chad! Let’s go! So they’re off Well, knowing Kurosaki, I expected that much However, the opponent is a high-ranking noble It won’t be that easy Princess! The princess has returned! What! The princess! This is urgent! We must go out to greet her! What! Princess! – Princess! – Princess! Welcome back This is a relief Welcome home, Lady Rurichiyo Hold it! I am Rukia Kuchiki of Squad 13 And the others He is Substitute Soul Reaper Ichigo Kurosaki The others are Sir Kenryu and Sir Enryu of the Kasumiohji Clan We don’t have a request for passage Please wait while we verify this We don’t have the time! Hold on, Ichigo We must comply Ruricchi, you’re really back I became the lord in your absence I’m sorry It matters not I have no desire to become the head of the clan But we’ll be together from now on! What shall we do Maybe cards or fan toss Oh, you prefer handball, don’t you How come it took so long to pass through the Senkaimon! We tried to go through without a pass, so it couldn’t be helped Thank goodness we got through without a hitch The ceremony is tomorrow We’re running out of time Damn it What will we do when we get to the mansion We can’t create too much of a disturbance Leave that to us! I will get Lady Rurichiyo out I am the chief chamberlain, after all! Is that important Certainly! I am the top retainer among the princess’s aides So I’m able to enter freely! Open the gate! Chief Chamberlain of the Kasumiohji Clan, Ryusei Kenzaki and Ruzaburo Enkougawa wish to enter! You…had names like that! What is the delay! Open the gates! What is the meaning of this! Silence! You two are suspected of abducting Princess Rurichiyo! Submit to arrest! Damn…that Kumoi! We cannot allow ourselves to be arrested here! Of course not! Then what’ll we do! Well… We retreat for now! Huh! – Hold it! – Hold it! Hold on! Hey, I thought you were a big shot! Why run away! We’re not running away! We’re falling back to regroup! Same thing! – Hold it! – Hold it! This way! This way! – Whats going on – Where are they! – I don’t see them! – Whered they go – No way! – Find them! We gave them the slip I’m surprised you have a place like this prepared This is commonplace in a noble’s mansion! Is that so I don’t know What will we do now We can use the secret passages to get— No, hold it What is it Judging from earlier, the entire mansion seems to be under heavy guard That’s because it’s the day before the wedding ceremony Then rather than search blindly, we should wait until tomorrow, when we’ll know exactly where Rurichiyo will be Wha—! If we did that, then— No… That’s probably better It will be an official event For Lady Rurichiyo to openly order Kumoi as the head of the clan No one will be able to ignore her In our efforts to protect her, we treated her like a child, and ended up pushing her into a corner She endured so much, and we couldn’t protect her Rurichiyo made up her mind and came here She wanted to confront her destiny head on Well then, I say let’s wager on her resolve! All right Kenryu, you can show us the way inside the mansion, right You can count on me! Wait for us, Rurichiyo The marriage ceremony of the 37th Lord of the Kasumiohji Clan, Lord Shu Kannogi and Princess Rurichiyo has been completed Lord Shu, the new lord of the Kasumiohji Clan, and his bride, Princess Rurichiyo, will arrive shortly! Stand in your place and wait! Look at that, Ruricchi! They’re all rejoicing over our marriage Rurichiyo! Let’s go! Wh-Who are you! Intruders! Intruders! Rurichiyo! Listen to me! Huh! What! Rurichiyo! Rurichiyo! It’s me, Ichigo! Hey! They’ve fallen into the trap – Ruri— – That’s as far as you go, Ichigo Kurosaki! Captain Soi Fon! W-What! Rurichiyo! In the documents we filled out to pass through the Senkaimon, there was a line for a sponsor Who did you name My brother If anything happens, he’ll be put on the spot, so be careful Anyway you look at it, it’s kind of obvious we’re going to cause trouble for him this time Crap! There’s nothing to do Jeez, I’m tired of just lying around doing nothing You guys! You’re too lax! They can call us up anytime! Hey, Red Pineapple Who you calling Red Pineapple! I’m ready to show off my secret weapon anytime! I can’t wait! – Man, I wanna pee! – Are you sure you guys are ready"
" Ichigo agreed to become the bodyguard for Princess Rurichiyo of the Kasumiohji Clan, a high-ranking noble family And he battled the assassins sent by Gyokaku Kumoi, who plots to take over After a fierce battle, Ichigo defeated Nukui, the leader of the assassins, but Ishida and Sado sustained serious injuries Rurichiyo is saddened after she saw the injured men, and in order to stop the fighting, she returned to the Soul Society alone Rurichiyo had been aware of Kumoi’s intent to kill her Ichigo and the others broke into Rurichiyo’s marriage ceremony, which had been arranged for her succession to lead the clan Rurichiyo!

Captain Soi Fon, please hear me out! There is a good reason for this This marriage ceremony and the installation of the new Clan Lord are invalid! Sorry… Can you give me some time Why you… Rurichiyo… Sorry We made you feel lonely Instead of protecting you, we drove you into a corner Even though we all knew you’ve been enduring so much But that’s no reason for you to shoulder the entire burden! If you’ve made up your mind, then we’ll support you Ruricchi… You don’t have to listen to Kumoi You’re the true head of the Kasumiohji Clan! If there’s anything you can’t do alone, we’ll help you Me, Kenryu, Enryu, Rukia, Inoue, Ishida, and Chad too! You’re not alone! So…you must do what you think is right for you!

Snap out of this, hey! Stop! Let Ruricchi go! Hey… If you’re Rurichiyo’s fiancé, you should know that  she’s not herself! Huh That Kumoi did something to Rurichiyo That’s… I-I don’t know anything You fell for it, Substitute Soul Reaper Why you… So you were a body double Ruricchi No way! I wonder what you’re talking about Why you… Do you realize what you’re doing Forgive me I will explain myself in time Please let me go this time That, I cannot do! Why you… That’s as far as you go, Ichigo Kurosaki! Hurry and go! I will leave him to you Come, it is dangerous Hold it! Ichigo Kurosaki! I thought you were more promising than this I misjudged you! Wait Listen to me! Enough talk! Ichigo… I’ll be right there Kuchiki! Lieutenant Omaeda! How dare you all treat me this way! Th-There’s a reason for this As if I care! Sir Kenryu! Miss Kuchiki, now’s your chance! Thanks! Why you…  Unforgivable! All right! Don’t let go of him, Enryu Let go! You! Who do you think I am There! Lieutenant! Are you all right Bloom in glory… Benishidare! Soi Fon! That Rurichiyo was an imposter! Where’s your proof That’s… You have to trust me, Soi Fon! Enough with your nonsense! You’re not used to fighting against Hakuda Why you… It seems you want to feel more pain Well then… Kill all enemy with your venom! Suzumebachi I wanted to finish this without releasing my Zanpakuto Here I come Dance…Sodenoshirayuki! Tsuginomai… Hakuren! Damn you Ichigo! Let’s retreat for now! Damn it! We have no choice Not that way! This way is safer Hurry! The Soul Reapers will come! There’s no sign that Ichigo Kurosaki and Rukia Kuchiki left the premises They probably escaped inside the mansion! All right Gather the available men and reorganize the squad We will go after them Yes, sir! Captain, what about these two Save them for later Right now, we go after Kurosaki and Kuchiki Captain Soi Fon… May I ask you to refrain from stepping inside the mansion Gyokaku Kumoi… We will smoke out those intruders ourselves So please capture them when they run out But… Captain Soi Fon… Such is the consideration given to a high-ranking noble family This should be safe enough Everyone’s in a panic since you came Shu Kannogi… You must be Lady Rurichiyo’s fiancé Why did you help us Well… I want to help Ruricchi! Where is the real Ruricchi Did something happen to her Wait, wait! Calm down a bit! I can’t calm down! I’m  Ruricchi’s fiancé! I want to protect Ruricchi! You… Hearing what you said earlier made me think Why am I here Our families arbitrarily agreed upon our engagement, but I’ve loved Ruricchi from the moment I first saw her Don’t stand on ceremony Are you Sir Shu Kannogi Even I knew that Ruricchi was in a most difficult position Yet I was right by her side And still, Ruricchi was all alone But… But I… It’s not too late Let’s protect Rurichiyo together First, we must get out of here But Soi Fon and the others have probably surrounded the mansion What will we do Umm… What is it I have an idea No word from Kumoi yet No Jeez… They may be high  and mighty aristocrats, but their mansion is  just too big, is all Why do they need so much land anyway! Omaeda, watch your mouth! Okay… Anyway, what happened to the two men you captured earlier They’re under strict guard Make sure of that Ichigo Kurosaki and the others may come for them No way! Not with all this security Reporting! Ichigo Kurosaki and Rukia Kuchiki have appeared through the back gate What! Get them immediately! But… They’re holding Shu Kannogi as a hostage What! Hold it! Ichigo Kurosaki! You werent satisfied with crashing the wedding ceremony, so now you are taking a hostage Captain Soi Fon, this is… Rukia… I apologize, Soi Fon Please move out of the way Move Let’s go Yeah Don’t come after us No way! Not Kuchiki and Ichigo Umm… Who is Ichigo Kurosaki That’s right You’ve never met him have you, Captain Amagai He’s a human who is a Substitute Soul Reaper We’re indebted to him Substitute Soul Reaper Something like that exists Ichigo Kurosaki and Rukia Kuchiki took Shu Kannogi, the son  of the Kannogi Clan, and have escaped into  Seireitei premises Squad 2 is currently tracking them, but considering Ichigo  Kurosaki’s power, I believe we need reinforcements I’ll go then Since you’re all quite close to him, it may be difficult for you I approve of Captain Amagai’s plan Deploy men immediately to the Seireitei! Squads 2 and 3 are ordered to capture Substitute Soul Reaper Ichigo Kurosaki and Rukia Kichiki of Squad 13 Yes, sir Umm… Head Captain, there’s one more thing What is it Kumoi, the senior retainer of the Kasumiohji Clan… He requested our help, yet refuses to allow us into the mansion grounds, he shows extreme wariness, and there are other  unusual circumstances It seems something happened with Ichigo Kurosaki as well I see I shall keep that in mind But… That is all Captain! Kira, did you get word Yes, we’re all ready The Substitute Soul Reaper It may be an uncomfortable mission for you all, but this is to protect the order of the Soul Society You understand that Yes All right Get ready to leave Umm… Captain What is it About…Ichigo Kurosaki… Did he really appear before the Kasumiohji Clan Yes Didn’t you get the report Yes Then what’s the matter Speak your mind Yes Well, I’ve been wondering what I should do But in this situation, I thought I should let  you know, Captain Recently, I saw Third Seat Kibune entering and leaving  the Kasumiohji Clan Kibune Yes I asked him, but he denied ever  going to such a place And You probably don’t know, Captain, but Third Seat Kibune has acted suspiciously before He tried to kill his comrades without hesitation And he was seen recording something during a battle He seems quite jovial on the outside, but there’s a very  different side to him Not Kibune I’ve never heard anything like that before It’s true! And this time, a problem has occurred within the Kasumiohji Clan, where Third Seat Kibune has been seen visiting And he’s trying to hide his connection to the Kasumiohji Clan There must be something— It’s too soon to conclude that Even if Kibune is somehow connected to the Kasumiohji Clan, we can’t draw any  conclusions from that Y-Yes Still, with all that’s happening and then this, he can’t complain if he’s suspected Captain… Kira… Did you discuss this with anyone else No, no one This is my hunch There’s more to this incident than we think And that would be I don’t know yet In any case, just keep an eye on Kibune’s actions If anything happens, let me know immediately Got that Yes First, we capture Ichigo Kurosaki Then we’ll deal with that Isn’t there an easy way to capture the Substitute Soul  Reaper and the others Why not put a bounty on their heads as well as a  reward for information Good idea! I’ll make arrangements right away! What’s the reward You pay it Huh! Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! MEN’S SOUL REAPER ASSOCIATION MEN’S LAVATORY How should I handle this What is it, President Iba Well, I was thinking of a big-shot Soul Reaper  we can invite to join us so that the Women’s Association won’t take us for fools Shall I ask around Huh So that’s why we want you to join the Board of Directors I refuse"
" Although Kenryu and the rest tried to keep it from her, Rurichiyo was well aware of Gyokaku Kumois true intentions Rurichiyo returned to the Soul Society alone Ichigo and his friends went after her and broke into the  Kasumiohji Clan mansion, hoping to rescue Rurichiyo during the marriage ceremony But they fell into Kumois trap and were surrounded by Soi Fon and her squad With help from Shu Kannogi, Rurichiyos fiancé, they managed to escape from the scene But now Ichigo is wanted by the Thirteen Court Guard Squads – Found them – No! Search over there! All right, lets go!

Groups Three and Four have spread out to the mansion grounds, but we havent found them yet Groups One and Two have returned Groups Five and Six have left to switch places with them All right Continue your search – Yes, sir! – Yes, sir! Still… Sorry… Can you give me some time Captain We received Squad 3s scheduled report Found them Nope, not a trace I see But those guys, Kenryu and Enryu… Was handing them to the Kasumiohji Clan the right thing to do Maybe we should have kept them in custody ourselves Captain Huh Whats wrong No, its nothing Dont worry about those two Head Captains orders are to let the nobles take care of their own problems Our mission is to capture Ichigo Kurosaki That is all Im going to mobilize the Punishment Force Take care of things here Right Unraveling the truth can come later Squad 3 has been ordered to stand by Take turns in groups to take your meals Yes, sir! All right, Group One, eat first! – How are things on this side – Make it quick! The rest of you  stay on guard Captain Amagai Youre back Yes I left the rest to Squad 2 Im taking a break I see I guess this is going to take time They seem to be pretty strong too It cant be helped By the way… How is Kibune acting No change I see If theres nothing, thats good It never feels good to have suspicions toward your teammates Yes… Captain Amagai! Come and join us! Right! Have emergency repairs been made to the damaged wall Yes, sir! We do not know when those bandits may break in again! Make sure to keep a tight watch! Yes, sir! So they slipped away The Thirteen Court Guard Squads are useless Master Kumoi… About Lady Rurichiyos meals… Her room is… The princess is closeted in her room due to todays disturbance No meal is necessary!

Internal strife in the Kasumiohji Clan And you were hired to be bodyguards Yeah I see But the fact that its the  Kasumiohji Clan is a problem It seems the Head Captain is hesitant to stick his nose into their affairs I guess its a matter of jurisdiction Unless theres concrete evidence, or some excuse to get involved There is The Bakkouto Bakkouto The weapons they use It is definitely illegal Also, to just take over a clan… it is way too powerful Oh And What do you guys intend to do Were searching for the place Rurichiyo is being kept The one who participated in the marriage ceremony was a fake Well find Lady Rurichiyo and expose Kumois crimes Luckily, Sir Shu is now on our side I understand In that case, well help you rescue Princess Rurichiyo Huh!

This is such a pain Lieutenant Omaeda! Hmm The security group has been deployed! What is your next order Maintain present status Huh Besides us and Squad 3, all squads have been marching around since this morning Now, the Punishment Force has joined them Which means there’s nothing else for us to do but to stay put for now If they were to harbor Kibune, this would be the most suspicious place But if the Court Guards keep coming and going, the chances are low that he’d approach I have to search somewhere else This is… Captain and Ichigo Kurosaki have… The possibility of a conspiracy inside the Kasumiohji Clan So what’ll we do now I have several places in mind We’ll check those Just us I’m helping you due to my personal feelings I cannot involve my squad So I sent them back to the barracks Aida and a few others have agreed to help out though Say… Why have you decided to help us so easily You may end up making enemies of other Soul Reapers I told you, I have some issues too Please tell me your reasons Well… First, let’s get away from here I’ll explain while we move Right Shu… Oh, yes! We’d better report this to Captain Komamura! R-Right! There’s a man named Kibune who is a Third Seat in my squad He’s extremely skilled But it seems he’s somehow  connected to the Kasumiohji Clan What! Furthermore, it seems he’s hiding that connection Having ties under current circumstances is one thing, but he’s had connections long before you guys stirred up trouble You think it’s connected to this incident I don’t know In any case, I’ve been having Kira watch him And now Kibune has been missing since this morning Kira is searching for Kibune’s whereabouts now So that’s why he wasn’t around It’s difficult to suspect a comrade But I have a bad feeling about this Then rather than coming with us, shouldn’t you report this to the higher-ups Kibune is a man I chose personally If it’s proven that he’s been dishonest, it’s my responsibility When that happens, I’ll deal with him myself Also, you should know this The Thirteen Court Guard Squads are very stubborn It’ll take too long to run things by them first That’s for sure You said you had an idea about where Ruricchi might be First, we’ll check out relevant areas inside the Kasumiohji mansion That is the end of Captain Komamura’s message Fine You may go Yes, sir! Head Captain, what will you do Make it known to all squads Captain of Squad 3, Shusuke Amagai, is suspected of grave offenses! He is to be pursued immediately! Yes, sir! I am calling an emergency Captains’ Meeting! What! Amagai did what! Yes Squad 7 members witnessed Amagai collaborating with Ichigo Kurosaki I see And that’s why we’re being called out What’s going on Just what’s happening Who knows Just… Right We can’t avoid a disturbance Hey guys! We’re the ones who first uncovered this Don’t lose to the other squads! – Right! – Right! Guys, it was around here – Y-Yes, sir! That is correct! – Y-Yes, sir! That is correct! But why Captain Amagai What are you doing there Abarai! Can’t you see I’m looking for someone, just like you Really But you’re awfully far from your assigned positions I hear your men were the first to find Ichigo and Captain Amagai So it wouldn’t be strange if they were still in the area, right You’re right But this is our assigned section Go back to your section, as ordered What do you think you’re doing, Abarai I said to go back Can’t you hear Sorry, Iba Don’t get in my way What Let’s go! I don’t give a damn about some Substitute Soul Reaper or the new captain of Squad 3 But if there’s gonna be a fight, Squad 11 will be there first! Huh You’re… Lieutenant Hisagi of Squad 9 This is Squad 9’s area Go back to your barracks What! Are you looking for a fight, sir! Don’t order us around just because you’re a lieutenant, or we’ll get you! Don’t take us for fools! I was a fool for trying to reason with you I should have used force from the start That’s just fine with us! Hold it! I’ll take you on, Hisagi! Madarame! I don’t know what this Captain Amagai is thinking But one thing is certain… I know Ichigo and Rukia better than anyone else! So Iba, let me through I don’t want you guys to get involved Please That’s true You know that Substitute Soul Reaper very well However, this is an order I cannot abandon my mission The same goes for you So get rid of your own personal feelings and act as a lieutenant should! If you can’t… I’ll have you leave, even if I have to kill you! I see I thought you’d be a bit more understanding If that’s what you say, then I have no choice I’m passing through, even if I have to use force! What a problem You guys Don’t interfere How was it No good No one’s seen anyone suspicious I see But there’s something even worse! Word has already spread of Captain Amagai going with the Substitute Soul Reaper! What! Inose, how did you talk to the head of security in this current situation They seem to have concluded that the  captain was acting on his own, so our squad isn’t under suspicion I see Captain Amagai seemed to be totally trusting of that Substitute Soul Reaper I wonder if he’ll be okay though We can’t say anything certain about that Up until now, we’ve left that sort of thinking to Lieutenant Kira and Kibune Speaking of which, where’s Lieutenant Kira He’s been out all morning, acting on the captain’s orders Cripes What’s going on anyway I guess it’s useless to  search at random Still, why did Kibune choose this moment to go into hiding Is it connected with the appearance of  Ichigo Kurosaki and the others Or… In any case, I have to find Kibune quickly Where could he have gone Now that I think about it, I know so little about Kibune I guess he was closer to Inose and Aida They used to talk about things only they would know I knew of its existence, but this is the first time I’ve ever entered this place Me too Well, people don’t use fighting arenas anymore But since we have access to it, Mr Kibune felt we could use it for our training drill A place to hide without anyone noticing Perhaps! That is all! In summary, capture Ichigo Kurosaki and Rukia Kuchiki And quickly restrain Captain Amagai who is suspected of aiding these two Head Captain! If I may say so, Captain Amagai’s actions are unclear There are also puzzling aspects of the actions of Ichigo Kurosaki and the others First of all, what reason would they have to infiltrate the Kasumiohji mansion I can’t believe they would act without good reason I think it’s necessary to investigate the Kasumiohji Clan No! I forbid any investigation into the Kasumiohji Clan! All squads! Carry out my orders! I don’t understand this Yes The Kasumiohji Clan are high-ranking aristocrats However, it’s probably safe to say they are at the root of this disturbance Yeah, you’re right At this rate, the chaos may even spread to the Court Guard Squads! Captain! Nanao There’s a squabble in the courtyard! Man, you’re so stubborn! Abarai, you haven’t changed at all What about you, Iba Orders, orders… Are orders that important! That goes without saying Covering yourself is the one thing you’re good at, Hisagi Madarame… Damn you! Split apart, Hozukimaru! Weren’t you going to capture Ichigo, Hisagi! Damn you! You don’t give a damn, do you, Abarai That’s because you’re in my way! I see Then what you’re doing is disobeying orders No! I will stop them That’s all What’s the difference Listen, Iba I can’t understand why Ichigo and Rukia would act so recklessly without a good reason But Ichigo won’t stop until he gets his answers… That guy What are you thinking, Madarame Take your squad and return to your position! Cripes You’re so stubborn as usual Think a little, will ya They’re on to something we haven’t noticed! That’s why Ichigo and the others are taking action! Can’t you understand! No, I don’t! That’s no reason for them to disrupt the order! You’ve met him before, haven’t you! That’s got nothing to do with this! Jeez That’s why you’re such a loser! That’s none of your business! What’s the matter – Lieutenant Kira! – Lieutenant Kira! This is… It’s Sugama, the one who’s been missing since last night The one who went after Third Seat Kibune last night Captain Amagai ordered us to return to the barracks, and the squadsman who stayed back found him You can return to the barracks – Huh – Huh Oh, it opened Anything is worth trying after all It is just like Ichigo said Thank goodness, no one seems to be around It seems nothing ever goes the way you want it to Who are they And that girl That’s Princess Rurichiyo of the Kasumiohji Clan Just what is going on I’d better let Captain Amagai know Still, the fact that the princess of the Kasumiohji Clan is here… That means… Who are you Don’t underestimate me You chose the wrong opponent Now you will tell me what you’re doing here What’s so funny You’re the one who chose the wrong opponent What Why you— What’s with their power Their speed and Spiritual Pressure rose suddenly Let me go! I said to let go of me! You are from the Kasumiohji Clan, aren’t you I am Rurichiyo! You are being insolent! – Hold it! – Let me go! You’re in my way! Strange… It’s not just us In various places, Spiritual Pressure is going every which way All this chaos resulting from just one order This is most unusual, isn’t it So let me go! I’ll prove their innocence If you’re going so far as to promise that… Well then, I’ll believe in Ichigo Kurosaki too You’re not the only one It’s likely we all do Most men have faith in that fellow However, we have to carry out our orders and find those two and Captain Amagai In order to prove their innocence, as you say If you cross swords with Ichigo, you’ll understand why he’s raising hell like crazy Until then… I won’t let anyone get in his way! So what’ll you do And if they’re really doing something wrong We’ll deal with it at that time! I will definitely… – kill him! – kill him! Damn! Can I catch up I must say, everything you do is always too late The princess left long ago, Lieutenant Kira As I thought Everything that’s happened is your doing… Third Seat Kibune Hisagi, you saw a lot of action today Well, it was like this until recently when Squad 3 started getting all the attention Huh I’d better do my best here It’s been bugging you, hasn’t it Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers Man, I’m hungry Want to go eat something All right! I’ll take you somewhere you can eat free, good food Come with me! What You came again Just in time Want some leftovers from lunch Sure! Leftovers But free, fancy foods…all you can eat! Don’t complain Don’t you have any pride"
" Ichigo and Rukia enter the Soul Society in pursuit of Rurichiyo They disrupt the marriage ceremony, but are confronted by Soi Fon and Squad 2, who were secretly assigned to guard the premises, and a fight breaks out As a result, they become fugitives on the run from the Soul Reapers I never expected to meet up in a place like this After being persuaded by Shu, Amagai agrees to side with Ichigo The Thirteen Court Guard Squads are thrown into confusion while trying to capture Ichigo Meanwhile, Kira, who is pursuing Kibune for his recent suspicious activities, happens to come across the place where the real Rurichiyo is being held, and he battles the Kasumiohji’s assassins Upon defeating the assassins, Kira is confronted by Kibune, who reveals his true nature I must say, everything you do is always too late The princess left long ago, Lieutenant Kira As I thought Everything that’s happened is your doing… Third Seat Kibune Group One will cover from here to Section Five East Group Two to Section Eight South, Group Three go from Section Four West to Fifth Street Group Four go around to Section Three North What about Section Two North, Central Street No need That’s under Squad 8’s jurisdiction But, it’s not that far from Group Four’s assigned section That’s an order If you move in a section outside of your jurisdiction, you’ll only get into trouble with the other squad – Yes, sir! – Yes, sir! Let’s go! The chaos within the Seireitei has been contained thanks to the work of the Punishment Force Deployment of each squad to their assigned sections has been completed Now commencing a widespread manhunt Oh You’re still here Kyoraku What are you doing here Our squad isn’t ready to deploy yet What’s wrong You have a glum look on your face I went to talk with Genryusai Sensei again But he would not listen Old Man Yama is a stubborn one after all I wonder Is there a reason that the Kasumiohji Clan is off limits to us I also did some investigating, but you know… it seems they’re not an easy clan to deal with What does that mean They’re high-ranking aristocrats, yet they rarely present themselves in front of the public And they aren’t associated with Central 46 that much either But I must say, Ichigo sure brings trouble with him every time It’s no laughing matter If we get attacked from the outside at a time like this… Oh, if that’s the issue Squad 12 is on it It seemed Captain Kurotsuchi was not too eager to get involved with the mess going on within the Seireitei anyway So it all worked out For now, we just need to do our jobs Right Yeah Oh, a Hell Butterfly What happened It seems that while Kira was going after Kibune, he found Rurichiyo Kasumiohji What! Where On the premises of the Squad 3 barracks Then that means… As we suspected, there’s a high probability that Kibune is somehow involved with all of this Amagai, I’m sorry, but there’s no time to get depressed about this Let’s rescue Rurichiyo! Yeah, I know In any case, this is misconduct caused by my squad We must hurry! It’s that way! Shouldn’t Squad 3 be located straight in this direction Yeah but… We’ll end up passing through the section assigned to Squad 9 Since when have they all become assigned to sections It shows that the Thirteen Court Guard Squads won’t be disjointed forever There’s a little space in between each assigned section If we move through those areas, we won’t encounter anyone Got it Let’s go! Hey Kenny, aren’t you going after Itchy Nope Why not I don’t feel like it You were also present during Ama-Ama’s Captain’s Exam, right, Kenny Yeah If Ama-Ama is on the run with Itchy, wouldn’t they find you responsible, Kenny I was just tricked into it by the old man I don’t care about that guy Captain Amagai! You all received word from Kira, right Yes, sir! Just what is going on I’ll explain later! In any case, let’s head to the fighting arena! – Yes, sir! – Yes, sir! Captain! Those guys! They were carrying someone! Could it be Ruricchi! Rukia, look after Shu! Wait! I’ll come too! Huh Aida, Inose, Kano! You guys, go to Kira! – Yes, sir! – Yes, sir! Kuchiki, take Sir Kannogi with you and follow behind us! Yes, sir! Let’s go, Kurosaki! Okay! It was you after all… Third Seat Kibune So you fended off my attack I guess I should say, it’s just what you’d expect from a lieutenant I gave them Bakkoutos, albeit a scaled-down version But it seems it was too much for these men The Kasumiohji Clan Are you… Lieutenant Kira I’m sorry, but please die now! Lieutenant! Third Seat Kibune What are you doing Why are you two fighting Where’s Captain Amagai He’s going after the princess with Ichigo Kurosaki! I see The message made it in time But what is going on here, sir Stay away! Huh! Kibune is our enemy! You can’t be serious! Third Seat Kibune! Is what Lieutenant Kira says true You’ll be in trouble depending on your response! You small fish are shameless What! I’ll kill you all together! Rampage, Reppu! All of you, get out of here! Too late! Raise your head, Wabisuke! Your dull-edged sword is useless before my Reppu! You… What did you do My Wabisuke doubles the weight of the object it slashes Slash it a second time, and it doubles again Slash it a third time, and it doubles yet again You can no longer use that weapon now that it’s become super-heavy Kibune, you will now tell us what your objective is What are you trying to do by working with the Kasumiohji Clan First of all, what is the Kasumiohji Clan Whatever the Kasumiohji Clan does is none of your business However, they possess tremendous power! All I want is to use that power and become even stronger! To become the strongest Soul Reaper! Wha—! What tremendous power Not even Wabisuke works What’s wrong, Lieutenant Kira Don’t tell me you’re dead already Kibune’s Zanpakuto is strong At this rate… You didn’t die this time But it’s useless to hide! Come out quietly! Do it and you will have a swift death! After all, your powers are no match for mine Third Seat Kibune… Come out! Izuru Kira! You said you wanted the Kasumiohji’s power, didn’t you From what I saw, you already have enough power Where are you Coward! You have that much power Why couldn’t you use it for good Power, you say Do you have any idea how much I had to sacrifice to attain my Reppu What would you know! There! Hado 31: Shakkaho! Reppu! Too late! Crap! What was that just now You! How dare you! Kibune… What is that “What,” you say This is a Bakkouto! Bakkouto Yes! This is the great sword created with the secret technique of the Kasumiohji Clan That vicious Spiritual Pressure… It is just like those assassins It’s not the same That only substituted for the lack of fighting skills for lowly individuals who couldn’t even use a Shikai But this Bakkouto utilizes my Spiritual Pressure and can grow endlessly Your techniques will not work against me! Why do you possess such a thing “Why,” you ask It’s obvious To have power! Power That’s right Power It’s about power! I have power But no one recognized it Back when I was in the Soul Reaper Academy, I was always at the top of my class in academics Yet I never got a call from the Thirteen Court Guard Squads during my academy years Why can’t I join the Thirteen Court Guard Squads! Other high achievers in the past all got in at the time of their graduation! You are indeed a high achiever But that’s not the only qualification You need to think hard about what you lack What am I supposed to be lacking! In days of idleness, I continued to train painstakingly for years After attaining a Shikai, I was finally accepted to a squad And no matter what the situation was I killed Hollows more than anybody But… My style of fighting was brought into question within the squad Instead of being promoted I faced the danger of being banished from the squad Why do you sacrifice your fellow squad members Because they lack power Then isn’t it the responsibility of those who have power to save those who don’t Though I managed to avoid being discharged, I was still sentenced to probation I was never to become a Seat Officer While other less skilled members moved up in ranks, I had lost my place within the squad and received orders to join the Expedition Unit In my despair, I stayed with the Expedition Unit and continued killing Hollows To get back at those who didn’t recognize my talent And finally, I encountered this power With this power, no one will ever be able to ignore me But it’s not enough! I need even greater power! With that power, I will make every Soul Reaper recognize me! That sword… It has consumed his heart Izuru Kira! Guys like you who have no talent, yet get promoted to lieutenant… I will sweep all of you away! Weakness is a crime Someone like you doesn’t deserve to be where you are When the previous captain went out of control, you couldn’t even stop him! Powerless people like you don’t deserve to stand above me! It’s useless! The killing blow Old Man Yama sure is persistent I received another reminder to deploy my men I was hoping to see how things play out a bit longer But I’m starting to run out of excuses to hold off the deployment How about we try, “they just left a moment ago” This isn’t like talking over the phone, you know Quincy Encyclopedia! Today is about the costume worn by a Quincy The costume design can vary depending on contemporary times and individual tastes However, it’s fundamental design remains unchanged We take pride in our costume And so, I present to you Ryuken Ishida in his costume gear! I have no intention of showing it What are you holding out for, huh!"
" may be inferior compared to yours Ichigo and Rukia continue to search for Rurichiyo after they disrupt her marriage ceremony The search for Rurichiyo goes on with Shus help and the support of Amagai Meanwhile, Kira tracks down Kibune, who had been acting suspiciously, and he comes across Rurichiyo in a Squad 3 facility However, due to Kibunes interruption, he fails to rescue her In the past, Kibune was not recognized as a Soul Reaper Out of frustration, he reached out to the Kasumiohji Clan and acquired their Bakkouto Kira confronts Kibune about this I need even greater power! With that power, I will make every Soul Reaper recognize me! Izuru Kira! Guys like you, who have no talent, yet get promoted to lieutenant… I will sweep all of you away! Weakness is a crime Someone like you doesnt deserve to be where you are When the previous captain went out of control, you couldnt even stop him! Powerless people like you dont deserve to stand above me! Its useless! The killing blow You bastard, just die already! You think youve dodged it How unsightly you are Why do you continue to resist What was your purpose in coming to Squad 3 If it was only to become the strongest Soul Reaper, there are other ways To show off ones power, one must attain a position that is fitting I see But, thats not possible Captain Amagai knows what youve been doing up until now Even if you kill me, you have no future! So what What! The Kasumiohji Clan is planning to use the Bakkouto to create a new world For example, with this Bakkouto, I can annihilate all of Squad 3 Is that the goal for you and the Kasumiohji Clan There is no need to know, as you are about to die! You… I wont let you do it Just what do you take your colleagues for! Those guys Colleagues Like I said again and again Weakness is a crime Never once have I thought of anyone as a colleague! I see Then I cant forgive you You ridicule the weak, and deceived your colleagues, only seeing them as someone to use for your own ambitions! So what of it For me, the most important thing is having squad members working together based on trust! And you violated that trust! Listen to you! Youre exhausted, Lieutenant Kira Im surprised your body is still holding up You can never become the strongest Soul Reaper! Shut up! Over here! Hado 31: Shakkaho! Why You dont seem to have noticed Since you entered that state, you were being spun around by the power of that sword What…did you say What you attained is not real power I couldnt stop Captain Ichimaru I am powerless! But I have a responsibility! To Squad 3… I have a responsibility to protect my colleagues! I cant afford to lose! Are you saying its a difference between our resolve That is not enough to make up for the difference in our strength! You cant beat me with force alone! Whats that! The Bakkouto! I see Your Bakkouto is that thing covering the Zanpakuto And… It is what negated the effects of my Wabisuke It appears your strength was nothing but a fraud after all True, my Wabisukes attack power  may be inferior compared to yours But that is not the only thing  that constitutes our strength Zan Ken So Ki! Only through that, and possessing a heart, can it really be considered true power! I will not… Not here… Kibune! I wont lose… to the likes of you! I wont lose! Has he become completely consumed by the sword W-Whats going on Hey, wake up! Wha—! Lieutenant! Third Seat Kibune! What is this! Kibune… As the Squad 3 Lieutenant… Im going to stop you! Lieutenant Kira! Everyone… Are you all right, sir! Somewhat Kibune… Lieutenant! Lieutenant! Tell Captain Amagai… Coordination between each squad appears to be going smoothly I understand Return to your post Yes, maam! Shusuke Amagai… His defecting could prove to be troublesome And… the Substitute Soul Reaper… I apologize Please move out of the way What are they trying to do You havent changed, Soi Fon Lady Yoruichi! You seem confused Uh… Its… How about listening to what I have to say Huh Hold it! Hold it, damn it! Let me handle this! End of the line! Let Rurichiyo go! Wha— Is she all right Its a doll Ichigo! Hows Ruricchi It was fake Oh no… Then the real one is… Yeah By now, she has most likely been taken to another location What! At the arena! I see Thanks So this Kibune guy and the Kasumiohji Clan really were… I cant believe it Since when I never imagined the Kasumiohji Clan was rooted this deeply In any case, you guys take Kira to Squad 4! Yes, sir You can count on us What are you going to do Well… This is no longer a matter regarding the succession rites One of my own subordinates became infatuated with the Bakkouto This is serious Whats serious Renji! How did you get here It was faint, but I sensed the Spiritual Pressure of Kira fighting So I came here, and I was right Never mind that, why didnt you contact me sooner, huh Very impressive, Lieutenant Abarai And What do you plan to do now that youve found us Wait a minute, Captain Amagai! Im friends with these guys! So, whats this about things being serious And it looks like Kira got hurt as well The Third Seat from Squad 3 was connected to the Kasumiohji Clan Lieutenant Kira uncovered that, and defeated him We dont have time to explain details But its a fact that something bad is going on Looks like youve got yourselves in a sticky situation I knew it Lieutenant Abarai… If you say youre going to be on our side, can you lend us a hand This is our proof of the Kasumiohji Clans treason We want you to deliver this to Head Captain Yamamoto and explain the situation This But Im in no position to… It would be better suited if you go, Captain Amagai No Im going with Kurosaki to the Kasumiohji mansion This is just my thinking… Theres a high probability that Princess Rurichiyo is inside the Kasumiohji mansion Why do you think so Now that their hiding place has been discovered, there is no other location for a cornered person to run Anyway, as a captain among the Thirteen Court Guard Squads, I must uncover their objective Besides… If Kibune was their trump card… Then it means Rurichiyos life is in danger unless we hurry I understand If thats the case, I will definitely deliver this to the Head Captain Im counting on you, Renji! Okay, leave it to me! Captain, preparations are ready for us to deploy! Just wait a little longer But, Captain, we have been receiving orders to deploy for a while now We cant wait any longer I know However… Yoruichi Shihoin! You havent changed at all I have something to tell you Well Wont you hear me out Once the Head Captain  gives the order to go, there is no changing of plans! I know that! Im not asking you for an answer right now! Then, what do you want me to do I want to show this to the Head Captain and have him hear what I have to say! In that case, give us some time! I dont have time! Whats the commotion Damn Another troublesome character Whatll we do What do you mean Ichigo Kurosaki! I know that youre there Come out! Toshiro… I knew youd come here Captain Hitsugaya! Listen to what we have to say! All right In that case, well hear it when we arrive  before the Head Captain Amagai… You! Go, Kurosaki! Leave this place to me! Captain Amagai! Thanks! Lets go, Shu! – Damn! – Get them! We cant have that Lieutenant Matsumoto! Rangiku! I dont have time to explain! Please! I want to let you go… but its an order Wait, Ichigo! Ill go! Rukia! Go, Ichigo! Right! Stand down, Amagai! Sorry, I cant do that It doesnt look like theres any room for discretion In that case… Reign over the frosted heavens! Hyorinmaru! Sever, Raika! Now the real battle begins! Notice! It has come to light that there were suspicious acts of high treason found against the Kasumiohji Clan All squads of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads will enter the Kasumiohji mansion immediately and secure this evidence! You ruffian! Sorry! Shu… Do you know where Rurichiyo is There are lots of rooms like that Maybe…the one in the back Kumoi didnt allow us to go near there! Okay, which way That way! Ruricchi… Rurichiyo, where are you Kira! Are you okay! Abarai… Why are you here My friend got hurt! Its natural to come visit! Its really because you fell behind and missed the deployment of your squad, isnt it Oh… Thats why, huh Shh! Arrancar Encyclopedia Today well be talking about the blue skies inside Las Noches Lord Aizen built this space in Hueco Mundo to replicate the sun But I think he only built this on a whim Why are you talking about this Looks like the story is about to take place here, so I thought Id help build up the excitement Isnt it because you just want to appear more often You want to appear more often, dont you, Tosen This is unpleasant"
" Kibune had come into possession of the Kasumiohji Clans Bakkouto in order to attain the power to become the strongest Soul Reaper Lieutenant Kira put everything he had on the line to challenge Kibune, who only believed in power After an intense battle, Kira was finally able to defeat Kifune, who had shown his true colors Meanwhile, Ichigo and his friends entered the Kasumiohji mansion in order to rescue Rurichiyo They battled against Hitsugaya and Squad 10 Go, Kurosaki! Leave this place to me! Thanks! Lets go, Shu! Reign over the frosted heavens! Hyorinmaru! Sever, Raika! Around the same time, having obtained Kibunes Bakkouto as proof of treason, Genryusai finally gave out the order to put down the Kasumiohji Clan Notice! It has come to light that there were suspicious acts of high treason found against the Kasumiohji Clan All squads of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads will enter the Kasumiohji mansion immediately and secure this evidence! You ruffian! Sorry! Shu… Do you know where Rurichiyo is Maybe…the one in the back Kumoi didnt allow us to go near there! Okay, which way! That way! Rurichiyo, where are you For generations, the Kasumiohji Clan has forged and delivered heirloom swords to the royal families that were used for ceremonial purposes The techniques they use were kept strictly in-house For that reason, they have maintained the right of immunity for a long time However, certain factions within the Kasumiohji Clan have taken advantage of the fact that we cannot  easily interfere with them, and went off to break the taboo of producing a  dangerous blade such as this Now that we know this with certainty, it is only natural that we make our move Head Captain, did you expect this outcome when the Substitute Soul Reaper… Im assigning Captain Kuchiki of Squad 6 to lead the raid Yes, sir! Reporting, sir! Head Captain Yamamoto has changed his orders! He has ordered all Thirteen Court Guard Squads to take control of our clan! What! Damn! That bastard What happened to, That will never happen! I guarantee your safety, he said That was the reason why I went along with his plan,  even at great risk Now I have no choice but to use these What A change of orders! Yes! Our orders are to seize the Kasumiohji Clan Whats going on Thats the complete opposite! I do not have any details yet It would seem we dont have to fight any further Lieutenant Matsumoto! Who are they! Theyre Kasumiohji Clan assassins! Whats this! These men are using a blade called the Bakkouto! Bakkouto This is the Kasumiohji Clans dark secret I see So we dont need to hold back, right Growl, Haineko! What is it with them! Dont they feel any pain Shuhei! Head Captain has given the order to raid this place! The Kasumiohji Clan is suspected of treason His orders are to assist the Substitute Soul Reaper! Which one of you is next They seem to be using quite unusual swords Theyre not beautiful Those things wont make you a match for us Dont let the other squads out do you! Show them the pride of Squad 7! Looks like they made it in time Captain Hitsugaya… Evidence of forbidden techniques connected with treason  have been found within the Kasumiohji Clan Our orders are to take control immediately What Im glad things didnt drag on any further, Captain Hitsugaya! Hey, wait! Rurichiyo! Damn it! How far does this continue! It is a huge mansion Well just have to keep going as far as we can! What the heck! Ichigo! Stand back! What! Are you serious! You mean their swords are all Bakkoutos! Their souls have been taken over by their swords Ichigo! Hado 33: Sokatsui! Rukia! Ichigo! Renji did it! The order was given to raid the Kasumiohji Clan! Is that true Yes! Which means that bastard Kumoi decided to bring out his secret weapon Yes Whod have imagined theyd produce so many Bakkoutos Rukia… Take Shu and go on ahead! The intense security means that theres something  important up ahead, right Got it! Ill leave this place to you! Go, Rukia! You bastards! Ill take you on all at once! Something seems to have started Ichigo Kurosaki and the others might have done it Yes Well use this commotion to rescue Lady Rurichiyo You mustve sensed it as well Rurichiyos presence Man… What is up with these guys! And the ugly way they fight… Cant something be done about it The way they fight… Its like throwing away their lives Or more precisely, they have lost their souls So this must be the power of those swords called the Bakkouto But theyre wrong to think they can stop us with something like that! Captain! Whats happening Exactly what it looks like It seems this was all part of the Head Captains plan The Head Captains! The Kasumiohji Clan is an aristocracy with a special status No one can interfere with them except under extraordinary circumstances The Head Captain already had his hands on information  that the Kasumiohji Clan was up to no good By sheer coincidence, Kurosaki became involved,  so he used him Thats… It shows just how much he trusted in their abilities Hes a wily old fox S-Sir Kumoi Why are you dressed like that Silence! Dont leave your posts! Reporting! Both the main gate and building have been occupied by the Soul Reapers! Fighting is still going on  in the garden, but we cannot hold them much longer I know that!

" became the final confirmation When Kira defeated Kibune, Genryusai acquired the Bakkouto, the proof of Kumois treason Genryusai then ordered the Thirteen Court Guard Squads to storm the Kasumiohji Clan mansion Kumoi ordered his subordinate assassins to hold off the attack as he attempted to escape into a facility protected by a barrier, but he was stopped by Yoruichis efforts Cornered, Kumoi tried to barricade himself in the tower by using Rurichiyo as his hostage Dont do it! Amagai… W-Whats going on What did you just do You did a good job… Substitute Soul Reaper Whats that… supposed to mean Ichigo! Rurichiyo! See you What the hell did he do just now! I have never seen such a Kido Most likely a special technique used to relocate while completely suppressing ones Spiritual Pressure That means… Yes I hate to admit it, but there is no way for us to pursue him Thats not an option! He has Rurichiyo! What is it, Amagai What brings you here out of the blue with the Kasumiohji Clans princess State your business Cant you tell I suppose you couldnt You probably never even dreamed that someone in Soul Society would be coming to kill you Kill me For what reason Shinetsu Kisaragi… Kisaragi Surely you havent forgotten I have come from hell on Shinetsu Kisaragis behalf to defeat you Bloom in glory, Benishidare! I thought I had completely suppressed my Spiritual Pressure Just what I would expect from the princesss guardian But your resistance is meaningless Silence! Benishidare, Sange! Princess! Quickly! Damn you! Shake, Daichimaru! What! Princess! Kenryu! Youre safe now! Princess! Enryu! So that is what your voice sounds like! Do not be embarrassed! It is a fine voice! Come, Princess! We must move now! Right! Kenryu! Enryu! Amagai… What do you intend on doing with that This This is the core of the Bakkouto The battles up until now were for the purpose of allowing this core to absorb the Spiritual Pressure of the strong And now, when I feed this to my Bakkouto… it will display its true power So thats what you were up to You were after the Bakkouto as well Of course How foolish Render all things in the universe to ashes! Ryujinjakka! Prepare yourself, Shusuke Amagai! How did you… What have you done The ability to cancel out the power of Soul Reapers… That is the power of my Bakkouto As long as this Bakkouto is active, all Zanpakuto are useless All except for… my Raika Bankai! Raika Gouenkaku! Are the two of you all right This is nothing Youre still alive Whats that look in your eyes Do you want me to kill you first Stop it I thought your beef was with me Those people have nothing to do with it Nothing to do with it Youre wrong You are not the only one I am after! I will kill the heir to the Kasumiohji Clan… along with you! Rurichiyo! Ichigo! Im sorry I took so long How did you…find us here Sir Kenryu left behind a Hell Butterfly So it made it in time Old man! Why arent you fighting back! Because he cant, even if he wants to My Bakkouto cancels out the power of Soul Reapers What! Genryusais flames have no effect on me! Amagai… I dont want to believe it, but… Are you our enemy, after all Who are you! Byakuya, are you done here The lieutenants are mopping up the remaining enemy forces Hows your end We have taken control of the Bakkouto workshop Captain Soi Fon is preserving the site as we speak More importantly, where is Shusuke Amagai Amagai He entered the grounds when Madarame and others first stormed in, but I havent seen him since What! Something happened to Amagai He is the true mastermind behind this commotion What! At Uraharas request, I was looking into the on-going confusion regarding the logistics of Soul Society In the process, I came across the cleverly hidden secret of the Kasumiohji Clans dark side Gyokaku Kumoi was the first to create a Bakkouto He developed the weapon by applying techniques used to create goods for the royal family The Bakkouto is a weapon that forces its wielder to display abilities beyond that which the wielder possesses The resulting toll, however, is huge I dont know where Amagai learned of the existence of the Bakkouto, but he approached Kumoi in order to get his hands on it And he was moving forward with some sort of grand scheme using the Bakkouto To that end, he needed to become a Squad Captain in order to gain a grasp of the movements of both the Soul Reapers and Soul Society Imagine that Anyway, Amagai, who became a captain in order to carry out his plan, began making his move With regard to the fact that the shutdown request for the Restrictive Current didnt properly go through shortly after he made captain… He discreetly voided that request, allowing him to show off his powers to his squad and win their support Then he approached the other captains to gain their trust, and advocated cooperation between other squads and proposed training exercises However, his true purpose was to analyze the fighting ability of each squad Then, as he steadily made preparations, he even took advantage of an unexpected opportunity You mean Ichigo Kurosaki Thats correct He originally intended to make his move after much further preparation, but Ichigos intervention caused confusion in Soul Society He instigated the ambitious Kumoi and magnified the commotion, instantly plunging Soul Society into chaos by using the Kasumiohji Clans assassin squad and Kibune, his Third Seat, whom he chose himself There was a report that Lieutenant Kira defeated Third Seat Kibune Kira did The fact that he defeated Third Seat Kibune became the final confirmation Amagai apparently didnt calculate on Kira winning He underestimated the Thirteen Court Guard Squads He was willing to go that far To what end About that… Shinetsu Kisaragi… How is it that you know that name Shinetsu Kisaragi…was… the name of my father Thats right My fathers name was Shinetsu Kisaragi The Soul Reaper you murdered! The Head Captain… killed him Old man, is what hes saying true Its true I killed the Soul Reaper named Shinetsu Kisaragi How did you find out that I killed your father After you cut him down, my father was still barely alive That day, my father was acting a bit strange I went to look for him Father! That place was where my father always trained with his Zanpakuto Father Father! Father! Why! Father! Please open your eyes! Father! Father was down to his dying breath, but he said it clearly That you cut him down That cant be Old man… Thats right This man killed my father, his subordinate Several years after the death of my father… I changed my name and enlisted in the Thirteen Court Guard Squads claiming I was from the Rukon district I did it to investigate the truth about my fathers death I gathered information And then I realized… Bakkouto That was the last word my father said! What was a Bakkouto Why did my father say that word It took many years, but I gradually came to understand My father somehow came to stumble upon the existence of the Bakkouto and was apparently delving into its mysteries by himself Then, in order to find out the truth about it, he infiltrated the Kasumiohji Clan But… In those days, you worked in collusion with the Kasumiohji Clan and were involved in the development of the Bakkouto My father grasped proof of that! That is why you… silenced him! On top of that, even if there were suspicious activities in the Kasumiohji Clan, you refused to intervene until now using immunity as your reason I… I swore revenge against you Defeating you was my only thought as I spent the years training myself Then, I approached the Kasumiohji Clan and obtained the Bakkouto I distinguished myself with the Expedition Unit Finally making it as a captain, I waited for my time of opportunity Now is the time for me to take my revenge for my father! Youre… Rurichiyo Kasumiohjis fiancé, Shu Kannogi You are Soul Reaper Squad Captains, are you not Yes, thats right Why are you here alone Please help Ichigo and the others! What Ichigo and the others followed Ruricchi and  Captain Amagai to the Head Captain! Out of my way, Kurosaki! Shut up! Ive been listening to you all this time You bastard That was nothing but selfish babble! I just told the truth Im not talking about whether that was the truth or not! Because of your selfish actions… other people were… Do you have any idea how much pain Rurichiyo was in! Ichigo… Her life was targeted over and over, and she went through one terrifying experience after another She wanted to be free, but there was no time for that If you want revenge, do it yourself! Dont involve people who have nothing to do with it! You stay out of this! You dont get it, do you Move! Youre the one who doesnt get it If you want me to move… youll have to force me! Yoruichi, you shouldve told us you were here as well Sorry! But it suits me to secretly work behind the scenes How should I put it I like seeing the surprised look on everyones faces! Just for that Just for that Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers Chojiro Sasakibe, Squad 1 Lieutenant Inspired by English gentlemen he saw long ago in the World of the Living, Sasakibe tries to master his tea hobby by growing tea leaves in Soul Society and brewing his own Huh! Lieutenant, the Squad Barracks! That wasnt me!"
" After Kiras efforts allowed them to obtain the Bakkouto, which provided proof of treason, the Thirteen Court Guard Squads stormed the Kasumiohji Clan and subdued their squad of assassins Cornered, Kumoi took Rurichiyo hostage and attempted to escape, but Amagai, who suddenly appeared at the scene, killed him Amagai was the mastermind in the shadows who plotted the chaos Amagai, who had been plotting the assassination of Genryusai for years, aimed for this opportunity when the Soul Reapers were called to help take down the Kasumiohji Clan, leaving Genryusai unguarded Amagai used the power of the Bakkouto Script to neutralize Ryujinjakka, and released his own Zanpakuto to settle the score quickly Now, Ichigo, who had raced to the scene with the aid of Kenryu and the others, stands in Amagais way Now is the time for me to take my revenge for my father! Out of my way, Kurosaki! Shut up! Ive been listening to you all this time You bastard That was nothing but selfish babble! If you want revenge, do it yourself! Dont involve people who have nothing to do with it! You stay out of this! You dont get it, do you Move! Youre the one who doesnt get it If you want me to move… youll have to force me! Ichigo… Rukia, take care of Rurichiyo Understood Kurosaki… You are a curious one You refuse to back down Bankai! Its useless What! What the—! I thought I told you My Bakkouto seals the Spiritual Pressure of Soul Reapers and the power of their Zanpakuto Your attacks are no match against me! Leave the princess behind and be gone! Shut up! Im not handing over Rurichiyo! You just dont get it It doesnt matter Either way, the princesss fate is set What are you talking about! She can curse her destiny of being born to the Kasumiohji Clan Im not letting… that happen! Theres no way youre going to kill me with that soft swordplay! Getsuga… tensho! Damn! Whats going on The Bakkouto should have sealed this mans Spiritual Pressure, but that technique just now, though weak in power… Raika! Sorry, but I have no intention of dealing with you forever Im not done yet! Im not taking that! Think again! Ichigo! Sorry to make you wait Its your turn at last Youre kidding, right Im just getting started Damn you! Bastard You said you sealed the power of my Zanpakuto, but I still have power to spare! You fool If you had just stayed down quietly, your life wouldve been spared Shut up! If thats how you want it… then I have no choice but to end your life! You cant beat me by just bobbing and weaving! Again! How can he be exposed  to my Bakkoutos power  and still have this much speed! He should be affected by the Bakkoutos power, but instead Ichigos power is increasing This Spiritual Pressure… Did he just reduce the damage by using his Spiritual Pressure This man must be… Whats the matter Kurosaki… What is the meaning in fighting me here Meaning, you say Im saying theres no need for you, a person from the World of the Living, to throw away your life intervening in internal strife within Soul Society That has nothing to do with it! Im protecting Rurichiyo! Thats all there is! Thats laughable Are you saying its that easy to throw away your life for a complete stranger Captain Amagais Spiritual Pressure is rising! If thats all your life is worth… then die Kenryu! Enryu! Wheres Ichigo Is it over Is what over Nothings ended yet What is that mask And what is that Spiritual Pressure Hollowfication… I knew it Hes fast! This power… its completely different from before! Interesting Dont underestimate me! I see So thats the Hollowfication Ive heard stories about My Bakkouto has the power to suppress the Spirit Energy  of any Soul Reaper and render their Zanpakuto powerless But when it comes to the power of a Hollow, its a different matter So it was because of this power that you were able to beat the Bakkouto up until now I get it now Thats why Ichigo was able to fight even under the influence of the Bakkouto And by Hollowfying, he was able to reduce the effects of the Bakkouto even further Right now, Ichigo is more than a match for Captain Amagai Then Ill have to get serious as well Why Why are you so consumed with revenge You probably wouldnt understand The emptiness of being left behind The hatred you feel towards those who remain The consciousness of those who hold those feelings is controlled by never-ending feelings of darkness You always think of but one thing Their death What is my existence No matter how much you think about it, the answer is always erased by a voice that says, Until you kill them, youll never see the answer Then it dawned on me That I would kill them and my destiny at the same time! Why Huh You possess the ability to become a captain So why dont you have the strength to move past that If I can accomplish my revenge, I do not even mind death! That is my strength! As I thought, you dont want me targeting your mask Ichigo! Im not going down so easily! Curse you! Youre not getting away with this Im taking you with me Your shape, your form, everything… Im going to incinerate it all! Gouen Ryuga! Whats happening! Ichigo! – Ichigo! – Lady Rurichiyo! Ichigo! You can stop now! I do not want to see anyone get hurt because of me anymore! Dont worry Wait just a little more Ill make it so… you wont have to make… that sad face anymore! Youre still coming at me Damn right! What are you doing, Ichigo I realize you can prevent a flame attack launched from an upright position that way, but… But still… What is he trying to do! I know what it is! Captain Amagais weak spot is his right side! Given the space that huge weapon needs, if he can get inside of it and target the Bakkouto… I already knew what you were aiming for! Youre after my right side… the Bakkouto, arent you Getsugatensho! Lady Rurichiyo! Lady Rurichiyo… Are the two of you all right For you, Princess, we would do this any number of times! Rukia! Its still too early for that! No… It cant be I knew it Its not over yet There is no end Until I accomplish my revenge… Shigekuni Genryusai Yamamoto… Rurichiyo Kasumiohji… And Ichigo Kurosaki… You too! I will take you all with me to hell for sure! Stop it! You cant do anything in your condition! As I told you… I will not find my answer until I kill them And beyond that…is death! Th-Thats… That mask… So Ichigo was no ordinary Soul Reaper You are correct, Lady Rurichiyo Ichigo Kurosaki is in fact a Mod Soul Reaper created by the Thirteen Court Guard Squads! Oh, how amazing! Stop it… Stop it! Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! Excuse me, sir A letter from Captain Kuchiki Thank you Please tell him I have indeed received the letter Its almost time, Captain Is it already that time Sorry, but I must excuse myself now Here you go, sir Please make yourself at home, Lieutenant Abarai Y-Yes, sir! W-What were those for! Its for his pet dog Goro Oh, is that right"
" Shusuke Amagai was the one responsible for the string of disturbances He did so in order to assassinate Genryusai He joined the Thirteen Court Guard Squads so that he could take revenge on Genryusai for killing his father After long years of preparation, Amagai waited for the moment when the Soul Reapers were dispatched to put down the rebellion by the Kasumiohji Clan, leaving few people around Genryusai Amagai’s Bakkouto possessed the power to render the Zanpakuto of the Soul Reapers powerless After rendering Genryusai’s Ryujinjakka powerless, Amagai used Bankai and attempted to settle the score once and for all However, Ichigo arrived and stood between the two, whereupon an evenly matched battle ensued Only Ichigo, who possessed the ability to Hollowfy, was able to fight without suffering the effects of the Bakkouto After an epic battle, Ichigo’s Getsugatensho finally struck Amagai Getsugatensho! No… It can’t be I knew it It’s not over yet There is no end Until I accomplish my revenge… Stop it! You can’t do anything in your condition! As I told you… I will not find my answer until I kill them And beyond that…is death! Th-That’s… That’s… Stop it! If you remain like that, you’ll… Gouen Ryuga, Homura! Ichigo! You underestimated me, Substitute Soul Reaper Could it be The Bakkouto has not taken control of him I am suppressing this with my Spiritual Pressure It hasn’t grown, has it You’re next… Genryusai! It appears you haven’t discarded your pride as a Soul Reaper Pride, you say! You, who spoke of order in the Soul Society, but eliminated those who did not follow your will I don’t want to be lectured by you, Genryusai! I will take care of both you and Rurichiyo! Princess! Ichigo! You’re still alive You’re a stubborn fellow I’m your opponent! Ichigo! Rurichiyo, don’t look so sad I’m okay You should be dead Why do you go to such lengths to keep coming at me There’s no reason why you should save this old geezer! Shut up, already! Bastard! Do you know how many people you made unhappy just for your selfish cause! You used the Kasumiohji Clan, tricked the Soul Reapers, and got involved with the Bakkouto You think it’s all right to do anything if it’s for the purpose of  taking revenge for your father! You think the people who cried because of you don’t matter! In spite of the chaos that occurred in the Kasumiohji Clan, Rurichiyo made the firm decision to shoulder that burden and live on! Rather than run from her destiny, she chose to challenge it She’s not like you, who chose to run from yours! I’m going to squash your stupid selfish revenge! Can you do that with the strength you have I sure can! Even if you can hollowfy, it’s still a fact that your Soul Reaper powers are neutralized That means you can’t bring out all of your powers So what of it You shouldn’t underestimate me! Don’t get so full of yourself, kid! His speed has increased If that’s the case… Gouen Ryuga! Got him! Now! Homura! What! Got you So that’s how… That was how you blocked my first flame Though I haven’t perfected it yet Once I get the hang of it, I’ll cut down all your attacks! Then I’ll end this before that happens! Damn! I’ll have to do something about the Bakkouto on his right arm, after all He’s guarding his right side As I thought, his right side with the Bakkouto is weaker In that case… His movements have changed He’s moving more broadly from side to side, drawing my attacks with him and reducing my attacks from the middle However… Raiendan! He attacked the ground to conceal himself Is he going to attack from there No, from the right Getsuga…tensho! I saw that coming! Getsuga…tensho! What! Ichigo! Lady Rurichiyo! Hows that You can’t use that sword anymore! Curse you! With this many injuries… Even if you defeat me and the old man, you won’t get away unscathed It’s useless to fight any further Useless to fight any further, you say! I told you at the start, this is a life that I’ve already discarded! If I can have Genryusai’s head, that’s all that matters! I’ll take every one of you bastards with me! Stop it, Amagai! If you continue to feed it any more Spiritual Pressure in your condition,even you won’t… I said I don’t care! The only way to stop people who won’t listen no matter what I say is to blow them away! Ichigo! Ichigo… Kurosaki… For someone who became a captain,  you’re doing a foolish thing What would you know! Revenge is my life! Ichigo! Ichigo won Yes Not yet Curse you, Genryusai I’ll get my father’s revenge! Stop it, Amagai! Master Genryusai! Old Man Yama! Stay where you are! Amagai! The Head Captain is not your father’s killer! What! Your father was a victim, swallowed up by the Bakkouto As you know, back then in the Kasumiohji Clan, Gyokaku Kumoi misused special techniques passed down through the Kasumiohji Clan for casting gift swords in order to develop the Bakkouto Then, using prototypes, he began experimenting on people When Master Genryusai became aware of this, he attempted to investigate, but… Cease your intervention in the Kasumiohji Clan Using their political immunity as a shield, he was denied permission to investigate the Kasumiohji Clan However… Master Genryusai… Please allow me to handle this matter Kisaragi… I shall find it and return  with the secret of the suspicious sword without fail Shinetsu Kisaragi… At the time, your father was Master Genryusais subordinate and an outstanding student Master Genryusai ordered him to conduct an undercover investigation in utmost secrecy However… A Soul Reaper, huh Well, well, you’ll make a valuable guinea pig Stop it! Kill the person who sent you here! Master… Both parties could not reveal the truth about Kisaragi’s death There was the secret of the Bakkouto, and the undercover investigation that violated Central 46’s orders As a result, Kisaragi’s death was kept hidden Master Genryusai seemingly repaired relations with the Kasumiohji Clan Those were probably the records that you saw Then… he killed my father because… The torment Old Man Yama felt after having to kill his own student… Can you imagine what that was like! No way… I was consumed by my hatred and was unable to see through to the truth You, and your destiny itself, seem to have been consumed by the Bakkouto Be careful of the Bakkouto Of the Bakkouto… I did a terrible thing So you’re Kisaragi’s son You are a lot like him Sir Genryusai… I was a shallow fool in all of this, wasn’t I You need not be ashamed Forgive my failure to save you and your father W-What is he doing! Byakuya… Shusuke Amagai still has his dignity to uphold He is a man who became a captain Let him end his life the way he wishes Kira… Sorry for dragging you into such a trifling matter Captain Amagai… I enjoyed the time I spent with you and the men Farewell Captain Amagai! Ichigo… I am truly in your debt for all you have done this time I owe everything to your people I am grateful Forget it Don’t worry about it! Ichigo Kurosaki… Thanks to your efforts, our clan avoided being abolished I thank you from the bottom of my heart Sure… That was the first time you received a decent thank you Shu… Will you be remaining with the Kasumiohji Clan, as well Yes The wedding was called off, but I…you know…still like Ruricchi W-What are you talking about I mean, I’m your fiancé… But, are you sure about this Succeeding the Kasumiohji Clan at your age… I do not mind It is the clan everyone tried to protect And I have also made my decision You’re finally free of people targeting your life, but you’ll be unable to play freely once more What are you talking about Thanks to you and the others, Ichigo, I was able to fully experience the outside world, was I not I will never, ever forget the World of the Living and you and the others, Ichigo! If I have those memories, I will be fine! Don’t worry, Rurichiyo! If anything should happen, we’ll be the first to race to your side! No thanks Huh Having to borrow your help would mean that the Kasumiohji Clan has committed another mishap like this one There must never be another unfortunate man like Shusuke Amagai That is my mission Rurichiyo… The next time we see each other will be when I’ve accomplished that Is that clear Yeah You can do it Farewell, Ichigo! Let’s meet again! I’m glad we managed to get that out of the way I need to get back quickly and report to everyone I have somewhere to go, so I’ll part with you here We’re in the middle of the Precipice World Where do you think you’re going To prepare for the next episode and beyond I don’t have time to explain Huh!

" Ichigo defeats Espada Number 6, Grimmjow, in a deadly battle and rescues Orihime But shortly afterwards, Espada Number 5, Nnoitora, appears and challenges him Unable to tend to the injuries sustained from his previous battle, a wounded Ichigo is forced to fight back As a result, his mobility is greatly affected Well, Iet me show you This is my rank Get it now That piece of trash you barely managed to defeat back there… Well, I rank higher than him Its over for you Sorry, I forgot your name Why are we running away Why! – Meanwhile, – Isnt it obvious – Ishida, Renji, – Our goal is to rescue Inoue! – Pesche and Dondochakka – Not to defeat the Espada – escape from Szayelaporros palace – Were not under any obligation – and are running deep into Las Noches –  to wait for him in a room – However… – where we cant use our powers! I agree! And now, it looks like well have to save Rukia and Sado as well as Inoue! It appears so W-What! This is… Welcome back Now then… Shall we start Act Two – This is terrible! – Hey, hey! Move! Let me see too! – I thought we had gotten outside! – Hey, I said move it! Damn youre huge! – Thats what we thought, and yet… – Let me see! I said to move! I cant see! Let me be surprised in real time too! How could this be! Damn it! Let me see too! Kick! Oh no! Well How did you like my palace I dont think an explanation is necessary, but Ill tell you anyway The inside of this palace is like being inside of my body It does what I tell it to You remember, dont you The first time you stepped inside this place Bankai! Hihio Zabimaru! You cant use your Bankai in this room I have complete information on your Bankai From its form, abilities, and Spiritual Pressure, to even its reishi composition I used that information to seal away your Bankai within this palace Naturally, I checked into your Spiritual Pressure as well Quincy! What You fool! Did you think that your arrow went through me! That it pierced me and went through me! Is that what you thought I am invincible inside this palace However, under the circumstances, I do give you credit for what you were able to do You managed to tatter my clothes But youll hurt a little if you get hit at point-blank range Hado 31: Shakkaho! Damn! How impudent of you, Soul Reaper! Its exactly as we had planned Hasta aquí… Its over, Szayelaporro Grantz Damn! Wha—! B-Bastard! Wait! Where are you going! Where am I going I had no choice but to change my clothes However, even during that time, I kept watch over you people There are hidden cameras in every wall of this palace And I can rearrange the corridors in any way I desire If I leave you behind in a room, its only natural for you to try and escape, like a fly trying to escape from a dragons open mouth All I did was make you run around from corridor to corridor, only to return to the same place So will you stop looking like that Like you want to say, We ran around a long corridor And we ran up and down long stairways And we ended up in the same room Like it was a bad joke Rather than something so trivial… The fact that such lowly fellows like you dare to irritate me to this extent, and are forcing me to fight with my full power… To me, that is a much worse joke Sip… La Lujuriosa Wha— Wha— What is… Whats this! Sorry to keep you all waiting Now the curtain shall rise on the long-awaited Act Two Oh no… Sorry, I take that back To be more accurate, it is the end of Act Two What is that! I dont know! Dodge it! I dont know what it is, but dodge all of it! Even if you say that… This is impossible! I-Im coming out! Wha—! Damn! What the hell are you doing! Yikes! No fair, guys! Me too, me too! Pesche! Yahoo! Theres more of me! Whatre you doing! You were dodging them until now! Huh! But, I didnt want to be the only one left out! Its lonely! Its better in this situation! Dont get so upset Dont expose me! Hey! Cut out the comedy! Now then, the characters are all together Lets start As you can see, your enemies possess the same power and abilities as you do Fighting haphazardly only invites death Yikes! However, be happy I have one piece of good news for you I lifted the trap that sealed off your powers in this room And so, you can fight to your hearts content against your alter egos and kill yourselves off Damn it! So before fighting the enemy, we must fight ourselves, huh Its like a Zen riddle Indeed… This is a bad joke Your moves are quite impressive Is this the first time youre fighting against a long-range weapon This is the second time! Is that so! Kurosaki! Stop this! Kurosaki is hurt! Shut up! Are you stupid So what if hes injured! This is a battle! Its supposed to be unfair! A battle is a monster from which inequality and intolerance are born! I dont like him I can beat him I cant forgive him For various reasons, one makes an enemy and at that moment, everything pulses towards a battle After raising hell right in the center of your enemys fortress, its pretty lame if you think no ones gonna come after you, Soul Reaper! So come on Of course, I watched you fight against Grimmjow from the beginning So I already know your every move This is bad This is bad, Uryu! Its kinda late to say that No, this is really bad With another handsome guy like that, the girls will switch allegiance! What a bad joke! Dont give him the time of day! Its irritating! Roar, Zabimaru! Quit talking nonsense and start fighting! Lets go! Roar, Zabimaru! All right! I guess we have no choice Lets get down to business! Lets go! Why avoid it I thought Id increase your handsome self in numbers Oh, its all right Theres more! What the hell are you doing! Im so sorry! Kurosaki… Too slow! What Does this just look sharp I shouldnt have bothered dodging it Kurosaki! Dont think that you can beat me with your level of power Your power is tremendous… But the manifested reishi called Rikka, which configures your power, is very fragile Even I could easily destroy them The only reason I dont do so is because your power belongs to Lord Aizen Lord Aizens order is as long as you are not attacked, do not destroy Rikka If you do attack, I shall destroy it Please do not resist Kurosaki… Wait a minute I dont see Nel! Is something wrong Oh no! Oh, I-Its nothing Thats right The Arrancar who was with you at the start I dont see her There Nel! Ichi… Are you… Nel I thought so That estigma… Youve become quite shabby, eh Well Does a cracked mask throb Hey! Whats going on, bastard You know Nel! Im scared! Please help me, Uryu! How mean of you to dodge me! Im trying to grab you because Im scared! I want you to accept me! Stop your nonsense! You grabbing me only seems like an attack to me! Damn! You managed to dodge our Dondochakka Press Attack! See, what did I tell you! It is an attack! I cant take anymore! Theres no time for this! What are you talking about We must look for Nel! I know that! Well look for Nel! As soon as we get away from here! No We must find her right away! I sensed it a while ago Nel is frightened We cant let Nel get any closer to Las Noches Whats this I wondered what she was doing here You brought her Well, judging from your face, youve been dragging her around without knowing who she is, eh What do you mean Well, if you dont know, Ill tell you This kid is Nel… Nelliel Tu Odelschwanck A former Espada Nelliel Tu Odelschwanck cant be Nels real name Theres no way Nel could pronounce such a name Inoue, even Nel can say her own name Right I cant say for sure Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers What am I doing in a place like this again! Huh I came to eat snacks! Just a little now Yay! What! Thanks for the food! Come again You can eat this "

Im the one who broke her head open! Nel! Stop! Not worried about yourself Have you forgotten Your sword cant cut me! Kurosaki! She was so irritating This girl here Just like you right now Dont go near Nel! Thats why I broke open her head from behind, and threw her outta Las Noches I said dont go near her! Shut the hell up! No matter how many times you try, itll be the same! What are you You cant beat me Cant you understand that No matter how times you try, its useless! It doesnt matter whether I win or not What!

Nelliel! Ichigo, please wait a bit longer B-But… Its all right Nnoitora is my opponent This time, I will protect you I shall teach you that the number on your back is totally meaningless now!

" Ichigo rescues Orihime after a deadly battle with Grimmjow, only to come up against Nnoitora Though his injuries are left untreated, Ichigo begins battle again, but he is overwhelmed by Nnoitora’s immense strength And Orihime is taken captive once again Furthermore, Nel, who had been hiding, is discovered as Ichigo and the others stand at the edge of defeat However, Nel suddenly undergoes a change Ichigo! Nel So you’ve returned to that form, Nelliel Nel Are you really Nel Yes Thanks to you, Ichigo, I was able to return to this form I want to thank you It’s all right It’ll be over in an instant Damn! I don’t look like that! Roar! Roar! – Zabimaru! – Zabimaru! Too soft! Even if our techniques are the same, a fake is still a fake! You’re not a challenge! Go! Damn it! There’s no end to this! I agree Well This is the limit of one-to-one clone technology However, every time these clones are defeated, they’ll split apart and multiply You think you can win Look out, Renji! You idiot! I’m the real thing! Oh, that was a close call, wasn’t it You need to ask! If you’re not sure, don’t attack! Watch out, Dondochakka! You look so much like Renji! Why you… I just know that was on purpose When did I multiply You fool! What’re you guys doing! I discovered the difference between myself and the clones and I  came here to tell you! Listen! First, the clones of Renji and myself… Other than the base of the eyes, there’s only a slight difference in our hair And it’s hard to distinguish! We’ll put them off until later! Next, Dondochakka’s clone His clones lack the spots on their backs This is very easy to discern They are not spots Call them polka dots Finally, Pesche’s clones I think you’ve all noticed As you can see… The fakes all wear pants! – What! – What! Hey, you’re right! He’s right! The difference is so great, I didn’t notice You didn’t notice Just what have you been looking at all this time Still… This is a big mistake Maybe he’s really stupid And who was it that didn’t notice this big mistake I’m not stupid You were eavesdropping! The loincloth and spots just didn’t appeal to my refined taste, so I deleted them They’re clones! You’re stupid to change them to your own taste! They’re not spots! They’re polka dots! Eat this! Too slow! – Roar, Zabimaru! – Roar, Zabimaru! – Roar, Zabimaru! – Roar, Zabimaru! Is this the end of Renji Ishida! It’s a losing battle to fight this many! Let’s get outta here! How! We tried and failed earlier! Well… I’ve got an idea! Bankai! Hihio Zabimaru! Idiot! If you use something like that here… Bankai! Bankai! – Bankai! – Bankai! – Bankai! – Bankai! Just as I thought They’re copies of me I had a feeling all they could do is copy me So I tested them with my Bankai, and they copied me after all Hey! Still alive What do you think of my brainy idea now! That was brainy! I’m telling you… You and Kurosaki are so much alike! Don’t start! If you bring Ichigo’s name up, I won’t feel like you’re complimenting me! Because I’m not! It’s an insult! Now then… How many are left Dondochakka and Pesche should be okay They’re pretty hardy The problem is Szayelaporro Watch out Knowing him, he’ll come at us from right under our feet! My, my… Look what you did to my palace How will I explain this to Lord Aizen I’m very displeased The clones! Let’s stop this I was very bored with this fight It’s time I personally stepped in I shall show you… the true strength of my La Lujuriosa Whoa! Stop, Dondochakka! Get your butt off me! I-I sensed it! Sensed what That we’ve been acting stupid all this time! It’s amazing A new ground level is opening up! All right! Don’t get excited Get your butt off of me! It hurts! It hurts! It hurts! It hurts! It hurts! It hurts! It hurts! It hurts! Oh, I beg your pardon It seems you didn’t hear me Even if it’s a fake, it doesn’t feel good to watch yourself explode Now then… Sorry to keep you waiting I shall show you… La Lujuriosa and its true power! Thank you for your thoughtfulness But we have no interest in something like that I’m gonna interrupt your performance Damn right! I’m the one who’s sorry You have no choice You’re being forced to appreciate this show Ishida! Crap! Delicious What! Ishida! Ishida! Hey Ishida! Snap out of it! Are you all right Hey! Are you I’m okay Don’t yell into my ear Hello… I’m over here An Ishida doll! What’s the big idea What I just answered you Because you were calling Thank you, Ishida Your role as “Ishida” is now over From now on, he is “Ishida” What You did, didn’t you Feel that touch Maybe I didn’t explain well enough To put it simply… This is the controller that administers your five senses In other words… Ishida! You see Furthermore… What are you doing! Stop… Stop! Damn it! Fool! Why are you panicking This doll is simply made this way Did you think that if I broke it apart, the same would happen to the real person No matter Can you see All these body parts… So what of it Nice and colorful, aren’t they Like a child’s toy This is the fun part of this doll Well, it would be faster to just show it to fools like you “Stomach” Ishida! Why you… Don’t make a fuss Just because I crushed this petty thing My, my… Just because I teased you a bit I just threatened you a bit and you couldn’t see what was in front of you You’re all the same Just like kids… Humans and Soul Reapers And Quincies too All of you You’re all so vulgar Abarai! If there’s a reason why Lord Aizen should destroy you… It is because… of your vulgarity I thought it was gonna be over quick Huh, Nelliel How many years have passed since you disappeared from here Don’t think that the Espada’s ranking is the same as back when you were here, Nelliel! Nel… Nel… You make me sick! Why did you stop your sword You did too Idiot! I stopped because I saw you stop your sword! You’re so irritating I remember the old days when Im fighting you You haven’t changed at all Not a bit since back then So what do you think of the Ishida doll This attack means nothing! I know all your weaknesses Next, I shall tear this cape apart! What! Damn, how dirty of you! Wait… There’s no need to bother with that part, is there Arrancar Encyclopedia! ARRANCAR ENCYCLOPEDIA Today we’ll talk about Szayelaporro’s sword release, La Lujuriosa It has pretty sick abilities, like creating enemy clones from the fluid in his back, or engulfing the enemy with his wings to create a doll that can control the enemys five senses Shall I create a doll of you as well No thanks, but… you’re being way too prominent there I’ll also become a regular in this show I think I’ll pass "
" Deep in Las Noches, inside Szayelaporros palace, Ishida and Renji battle against clones of themselves created by Szayelaporro Look what you did to my palace How will I explain this to Lord Aizen Im very displeased Ishida! Delicious Upset by Ishida and Renjis resistance, Szayelaporro uses the power of his La Lujuriosa to create a doll with which he controls Ishidas five senses This doll has toy-like body parts Inflicting damage on the body parts causes damage to Ishida as well It is a deadly and ruthless power Szayelaporro toys with Ishida and wounds him Furthermore, a doll linked to Renji is also created Why you… Dont make a fuss Just because I crushed this petty thing My, my… Just like kids… Humans and Soul Reapers And Quincies too All of you Youre all so vulgar Meanwhile, Ichigo has emerged  victorious from a fight to the death with Grimmjow, and he rescues Orihime Now before him, a battle between Espada Number 5, Nnoitora, and Nelliel loomed Why did you stop your sword You did too Youre so irritating I remember the old days when Im fighting you You havent changed at all Not a bit since back then There I somehow managed to get out Pesche! Are you all right Ill save you in a minute! Thanks, Dondochakka! This is so heavy I need to take a break Hey! Dont stop to rest! I can almost see outside! Even if we can see outside, the only thing in sight is Renji and the others beaten up by Szayelaporro Thats right I was thinking back then…you know… Hey, I can see outside! When Szayelaporro does his sword release, it sorta looks like udon noodles Now that you mention it… Maybe we should nickname Szayelaporros attack Szayelaporro Udonz No, I dont think so Oh, is that so Then whyd you  bring it up in the first place! Youre the one who said it looked like udon noodles! Quit babbling nonsense and get me out Pesche, youre the one whos babbling Im out Oh no! We cant waste time here! Master Nel… Nel… W-Wait, Kurosaki! Youre not… Nel is in a bind I have to help her Kurosa— Dont move I wont let you get in Master Nnoitoras way That woman… Nelliel Tu Odelschwanck is a rock A rock that resists Master Nnoitoras blade must be destroyed By Master Nnoitora himself There, were done Im glad we ended it in time for lunch If Im late, those two will be worried Hold it! I said this was to the finish Stay until were done By that, you mean until death Do you even need to ask I refuse Dont talk like youre worth it What! We all transformed from humans to Hollows, becoming beasts And as Arrancar, we regained our reason Those who possess reason need to have a purpose to fight You dont have that Theres no reason for me to fight you I have no obligation to kill you Sure, theres a reason! I dont like you! Thats not a reason Thats instinct You are a beast I dont acknowledge you as a warrior You are not worthy of being my opponent I dont intend to be responsible for a life that doesnt belong to a warrior Damn you! Nnoitora… Are you all right Can you stand Dont get too friendly with me Just because I cant beat her, dont think youre my equal, Tesla Why Master Nelliel Why not some other Espada I dont like it!

Pesche! Dondochakka! Pesche! Dondochakka! Where are you Its time for dinner Pesche! Dondochakka! Where are you Where are you hiding Huh Pesche… Dondochakka! Where could those two have gone Im hungry Hey Not you again Are you looking for something Its none of your business Walking around with your weapon is very threatening If you want to look strong, you should put it away and walk Pesche… Dondochakka… I-Im so sorry… Master Nel You tore off their masks forcefully How could you! So what of it They were weak Thats all it is Well I gave you a reason to fight me, didnt I No… This is not a reason to fight What But you injured my dear friends And youre going to pay for that! Damn it! I cant stand this Youre slow! Youd probably say only beasts act like this As if I care Fighting is simply about winning or losing Reasons, or whatever, dont mean crap Reason isnt a part of fighting to begin with You looked for a reason and lost It makes me sick Want something Your job is supposed to be over Szayelaporro Such cold words Werent we comrades who joined forces for our mutual goals Let me witness the end at least I dont recall joining forces with you I took advantage of you, thats all You would fight Nelliel And I would inspect my new device That is why I choose to join your fight Cooperation is forged out of common interest Because its advantageous, thats all So philosophical Makes me want to puke Nelliel… Its not power that divides us Its experience Before you heal that wound and return to Las Noches, I will surpass you To a higher place where your sword cannot reach me Lets go Dont order me around Even though youre not an Espada Oh… You found an opening in your fight against Nelliel thanks to the device that I developed I dont think you should speak to me like that Isnt that a fact Thats what I mean by common interest That Spiritual Pressure… She turned into a kid! How exciting Ive never seen such a phenomenon Spiritual Pressure flowed out from the wound where the mask was cracked And the soul itself shrank Or… Who cares about your theories! Look at you now, Nelliel! That body suits you perfectly! Looks like we wont have to cross swords Thats my only regret What is this place Who are you Wha— Has she lost her memory Head…hurts P-Peshce! Be quiet, Dondochakka Theres only one path we can take Master Nel… Master Nelliel Tu Odelshcwanck has died Her mask was split open, her power lost as well as her memory That is not Master Nel before us So… We must protect her From Nnoitora and Szayelaporro, from suffering and hardship From all dangers and disasters We must take Master Nel, who has grown so weak, and protect her with our lives! As one who has sworn to serve Master Nel as our master… That is our one remaining, and final duty What a persistent fellow you are Ive brought you down countless times Why cant you just lose consciousness I said youre too persistent I just broke your left Achilles tendon Now, what shall I break next If I play with too many organs, your life will be at risk Damn you!

What How come thats coming out of Dondochakkas mouth Bawabawa is one of the Combat Spirit Bugs that Dondochakka houses inside his body But we havent told Master Nel about it We feared that information about us would trigger Master Nels memory to return! Master Nel did not like to fight She was finally released from the endless cycle of fighting We didnt want Master Nel to regain her memories of fighting We wanted to protect her in peace That was our duty However… Master Nel has the will to fight right now! If Master Nel says she will fight, it is our duty to assist! We cannot be bothered by the likes of you Szayelaporro! Here we come! Will you still resist You sure dont know when to give up, do you How unfortunate I thought it would be rough, so I really didnt want to use it so soon after I returned to this form Praise… Dondochakka, we did it! Did what Not showing your face on screen signifies youre a handsome man of mystery and strength! Im sure weve caught the hearts of the ladies! I only appeared in shadows, does that mean Im not handsome Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers Pardon me I have some documents What are you doing Be quiet Our captain is taking a nap Huh! At this hour! He seems to be testing the theory that children who sleep grow tall ISANE KOTETSU 187 CM AND GROWING I wont sleep starting today "
" Nelliel and Nnoitora once worked together as fellow Espada Nnoitora, however, detested Nelliels presence and challenged her to duels on numerous occasions He was beaten each time You are a beast I dont acknowledge you as a warrior You are not worthy of being my opponent I dont intend to be responsible for a life that doesnt belong to a warrior Nnoitora could never defeat Nelliel one on one, but with the cooperation  of Szayelaporro, he set a trap and at last succeeded  in defeating Nelliel He then threw her out of Las Noches At that moment, Spiritual Pressure  flowed out of her injured body, and Nelliel turned into a child Look at you now, Nelliel! That body suits you perfectly! What is this place We must protect her From Nnoitora and Szayelaporro,  from suffering and hardship From all dangers and disasters We must take Master Nel who has grown so weak, and protect her with our lives! As one who has sworn to serve Master Nel as our master… That is our one remaining, and final duty Whats the meaning of this Okay, I got it! Now, Dondochakka! Release Bawabawa! If Master Nel says she will fight, it is our duty to assist! We cannot be bothered  by the likes of you… Szayelaporro! Here we come! Will you still resist You sure dont know when  to give up, do you I thought it would be rough, so I really didnt want to use it so soon after I returned to this form Praise… Gamuza Lanzador Verde The likes of you, is it Thats big talk coming  from lowly Fracciónes Wait a minute What are you trying to… take out! Ohh! He managed to  strike the bastard! Or rather is that okay  to broadcast Did you see that! This is my sword, called Ultima! This beautiful and shiny blade  is a saber of light that shows its form because  of Reishi pouring out What do you think, Uryu  Looks familiar, doesnt it! Doesnt it look like your thing! It doesnt! And dont go calling it a thing I was expecting a bigger reaction,  you gutless fool! He called me, whose organs have been destroyed, gutless as in without guts GUTS GUT-LESS Hi, good boys and girls! This character means guts! Its a bit difficult, but this is how its written And, if we take this out, GUTLESS we get gutless! That wasnt funny at all You have a lot more energy left  than I expected For someone whos gutless… whose organs are really gone… Let me tell you! My thing is a lot harder  than your thing, and it throbs and… PLEASE STAND BY Good boys and girls! Please do not do this at home! What do you say now that you know my power! Go… You guys Wring that annoying eel monster to death In the meantime… Ill squash the two below it! This is my sword! Szayelaporro… There is but one reason for your defeat You took us lightly, thinking of us as adversaries you once defeated In order to protect Master Nel, we have never stopped training We are now at a different level  than we once were Take this And perish! This is the new Cero we created! Incredible… The lights from the Cero joined together Cero Sincretico! Its over, Nnoitora What is Relax… I will not take your life What Why did Nel… Its over, Nelliel! Nel! Nel! Kurosaki! Give it up Nelliel was your final light Its gone out Its over for all of you here!

You just watch quietly from here, okay Gore them, Verruga Pet, keep quiet Listen… Your job is to be quiet and watch… as the man who came  to rescue you ends up pounded into a beat-up old rag! Kurosaki… Kurosaki… Kurosaki… Kurosaki… Why Why didnt it work on you! Why didnt it work on me, you ask Fused forces definitely possess  immense destructive power However, if they do not blend completely and fail to transform totally, they readily split into two forces I simply applied a tiny amount of power to the right point Why Why is it! Why is such a thing possible Why Why You sure ask a lot of questions But, I will tell you The reason is because you gave me too much time Did you think I wouldnt notice just because you changed  your masks I realized it right away, from the moment I saw you two I knew that you two were Nelliels Fracciónes Thats why I continued to measure everything Your movements, Spiritual Pressure, and experience as you fought with the Quincy and Soul Reapers What! Cero Sincretico, was it That was a totally powerful and wonderful technique However, it was within my expectations Pesche Gatiche… Dondochakka Bilstin… I will tell you The reason why you lost was because you did not use this technique at the moment this fight began Now then… Can I assume youve exhausted all your tricks You worked very hard, all of you But I think this fun, but lengthy, performance is finally about to come to a conclusion Lets end…everything Aaroniero Arruruerie The last remaining Espada from the first generation has met a tragic end And, as I thought… They were soft at the end Soft… Each and every one  of them I thought, They cant be alive They should be dead But there is no way to be sure that they are dead unless you break off their heads Do not worry, Aaroniero I will clean up your mistake Both of them are still just barely alive We will begin retrieval Kurosaki… Kurosaki… Kurosaki! Kurosaki! Kurosaki! Inoue… Its over Kurosaki… Kurosaki… Kurosaki… Kurosaki… Kurosaki! Kurosaki! This is stupid Tesla… Finish it What is this You look like youre about to die Ichigo! Cero Sincretico had no effect! The fusion was insufficient! In that case, join us, Uryu and Renji! Leave it to us! Lets go! – Combine! – Combine! Ishida! Whatre you waiting for Get over here! I absolutely refuse ARRANCAR ENCYCLOPEDIA Arrancar Encyclopedia! Today, Ill tell you about Nelliel Formerly the Espada Number 3, her special technique is Cero Doble and her Zanpakuto is called Gamuza Her kill technique is Lanzador Verde Shes very pretty Whatre you talking about This is you What!

You kicked me in the gut with all youve got! Howd you get here, anyway Kisuke Urahara That guy was given a bunch of orders from the old man when the showdown was set for winter One of those orders was to stabilize some sort of underground cavern called a Garganta, and once it was totally secure, make it possible for captain-level personnel to pass over to Hueco Mundo The guy said it would take only one month to finish what was believed to take three months But before he could do it, that woman there was snatched away And so that cavern was finally fortified Thats why Kenny came here! Yachiru! You stay out of this! Who are you I regret that I cannot tell you my name, but that is also fate Pass on, Soul Reaper For crying out loud… I said I could handle this by myself No one listens! Who are you Squad 4 Captain of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads, Retsu Unohana Likewise, Lieutenant Isane Kotetsu That coat… I take it you are of captain standing I am Espada Number 7, Septima Espada, Zommari Rureaux Now identify yourself, intruder Who am I, you ask Is there some meaning in answering that What! Theres no need for an answer Our identities are one We are your enemies I see We have only come to heal everyones wounds We have no intention of fighting with you As long you do not interfere in our efforts, we have no intention of interfering with you Arrancar… Arrancar… Arrancar… Espada! Fascinating, indeed! Hueco Mundo is quite a treasure trove of riches! I, too, wish to ask a question Are you the one who fought with her It was not me However, I was about to administer the finishing blow I see So you finally attacked I was waiting for this Come at me like your life is at stake! Damn you, Kenpachi! You must not act on your own like this! Injured people keep out of this! What! I can still… No, you dont, Itchy! Y-Yachiru! Dont! Youre killing Kurosaki! Oh no… His head just drooped! Kurosaki! Dont pass out! Seems like I saw this just a while ago Itchy, you have to stay out of this! Because… Kenny has that look on his face Its okay now, Kenny! Yachiru, stay right there Okay! Are you mocking me Ive got no intention of joining your circus! Hey, is that all youve got Looks like we can have some fun Whats your name, Soul Reaper Squad 11 Captain, Kenpachi Zaraki! Im Quinto Espada, Nnoitora Gilga! It would seem a very sensible captain has appeared before us Were leaving – Wait! – Isane Our role is not to spill blood, but to stop it from being spilled We will not pursue those who choose to run away Come, we must heal them Sado, and that Arrancar C-Captain Kurotsuchi! W-Why…are you here! So, is this man someone you know, Quincy Know Hardly I dont know such inferior beings What! Quincy… Aside from the fact that there arent very many of them, they are of no value or interest to me now Why you… You came all the way here to insult us! – Ta-da! – Ta-da! – Two out of Three – Two out of Three – Great Desert Brothers, are back! – Brothers of the Burning Sands, are back! You guys! What were you fighting about while we were gone! And, youre not very convincing when you try to act strong in that beat-up condition, Ichigo…I mean, Uryu! Quit screwing with me already! Youre all messed up, yourself! What did you say! Unlike you, its not my body thats messed up! Im psychologically messed up because Cero Sincretico didnt work! Got that, Uryu Thats even worse! Stop fighting amongst yourselves Its unsightly Now, let me ask you again Who on earth are you On second thought, I wont ask your name I will, after all, just eliminate you It would be a waste of time to ask your name You think so On the other hand, it would be a problem if I dont hear your name Why is that Why Are you an idiot That should be obvious So when I stuff you in a jar, I can write your name on it Is something the matter Arent you going to come at me, intruder Just so you know, if you intend to rescue that collapsed Soul Reaper there, its no use Dont try it I dont get it What do you mean by, its no use This is what I mean This is what I mean Just as I would expect of a captain Your speed is outstanding And your reactions are superb However, that is, for a Soul Reapers level, of course What do you mean by that Inoue! Hey Inoue! Are you okay Yes, Im fine What about you, Kurosaki Im okay, but… That damn Kenpachi How long is he going to go all-out! That was pretty good Looks like we could have an interesting duel So let me enjoy this a little longer! Same here! Put me in a jar Hes laughing What just happened I dont get what was so funny at all! Theres no way I couldve missed that guys joke No, that wasnt a joke that he told What! Then are you saying that guy made Szayelaporro laugh without telling a joke! What sort of miracle is that! Who is that guy! Just what sort of trick did he use! Oh, shut up, already! Keep quiet, you guys! Oh, come on Youre as cold as a woman who has absolutely no interest in the man she left! You annoy me! Shouldnt overdo it, Uryu Youre all messed up Messed up Messed up! Hes right! Okay then! Were cheering on the warriors! Thats right! Gemelos Sonido Among the Espada, my Sonido is the fastest And by a adding a small step, Ive completed something resembling a pseudo clone You might say its like playing with magic Magic is used to astound ones audience, so theres no need to be ashamed if you are astounded because you cannot follow it with your eyes I see However, you should be ashamed Youve already shown your cards to me Too bad Gemelos Sonido isnt limited to two bodies I suppose it isnt Hado 4: Byakurai I grow weary of this K-Kenpachi! Earlier, I said it would be a waste of time to ask your name However, you said something quite intriguing to me, so as a show of respect to you I think I will ask you your name so that you can become my marionette This is bad! Those feathers are… Captain Kurotsuchi! Gemelos Sonido has a maximum of… five bodies Whats the matter Dont tell youre shocked just by this level At this rate, Ill be far from satisfied Im waiting for you! Come at me like your life is at stake! Damn it! Its what happened to us all over again! You might be a captain, or whatever, but you coming here isnt going to change anything greatly Im afraid your expectations are about to go up in smoke I sympathize with your meaningless end Oh, do you Farewell, captain whose name I dont even know The reason for your defeat is the arrogance of not even stating your name Stealth Hoho, Shiho Number 3: Utsusemi I wish I didnt have to use a technique I learned from her What! This is what Ive been waiting for! This feeling that sends tingles through my body! From here on, its kill or be killed! No more feeling each other out! It is I who sympathizes with you Because starting now, you are about to experience a world your comprehension cannot keep up with You are the arrogant one, Espada But do not fret The reason you will lose is not because of your arrogance It is simply a difference in skill What did that Nnoitora do by sticking his finger in the ground That is how he measures Spiritual Pressure You! I thought Kenpachi killed you! If I dont explain it, who will Master Nnoitora is not that nice So true ARRANCAR ENCYCLOPEDIA Arrancar Encyclopedia Today, Ill tell you about Zommari Zommaris skilled technique is called Gemelos Sonido By adding steps to his Sonido, he creates clones to dazzle his opponents My Sonido is the fastest among the Espada As I said, youre being arrogant What Hey! How far are you guys going "
" Ichigo won his battle with Grimmjow However, Espada Number 5, Nnoitora, suddenly showed up and overwhelmed Ichigo with his great strength Nelliel, who regained her powers in her attempt to save Ichigo, reverted to her former child form on the very brink of victory Once again, Ichigo found himself in a pinch while facing Nnoitora However, he was saved by someone he never expected What is this Kenpachi!

You are the arrogant one, Espada But do not fret The reason you will lose is not because of your arrogance It is simply… a difference in skill It’s cold I should’ve worn something warmer That wasn’t nice of Captain Kuchiki He disappeared the moment he arrived Before we departed, I thought I made it clear to him that I can’t use the Flash Step That hurt Huh Which way should I go Arrogant Me Why do you believe that You are an enemy, but you are a captain I consider you to be my equal, and I have conducted myself in that manner I have no arrogance An Arrancar… considering himself to be my equal… I’m saying that in itself is already arrogant I see It would seem… arrogance is part of your nature Very well Then I shall crush your hubris… and your very being, turn them into pulp Subside… Brujeria! What’s the matter You sensed that I was about to unleash an attack, but nothing happened You seem to want to say that you don’t get it Unfortunately… Something has already happened Your left leg has become mine What is this All things are subject to control Subordinates are under the control of their superiors The masses are under the control of their king, clouds are under the control of the wind, and the light of the moon is under the control of the sun The power of my Brujeria is the ability to take control of whatever my eye stares at I call this power “Amor” You still look like you want to say you don’t get it I sympathize with you It must be difficult when you’re not too bright and there are many things you don’t get Even if you don’t get it, if you experience it with your body, you will understand Now then… Left leg come here It’s meaningless to resist Your control does not extend to your left leg Now, take another step Oh… You instantly slashed your left leg muscles and tendons Indeed, now I cannot move them A swift decision and immediate action Magnificent All right then How about this one Oh… You’re able to move that well, even on one leg I have to hand it to you, Captain I am truly impressed Damn you Oh, there he is! Thank goodness I finally caught up with you! It was mean to leave me behind, Captain Kuchiki! Didn’t I tell you that I can’t do Flash Step! I’m not very quick, and I felt uneasy in an unfamiliar place, and the inside of the building was freezing cold, and I was hungry, and I didn’t know my way, and I almost got lost Captain Kuchiki! Your leg is badly hurt! And is this Rukia! Rukia! Quite the chatterbox has arrived Hanataro Yamada Y-Yes Stay back R-Right! I’ll move back right now! I’m in the way, aren’t I I’ll say it once more Stay back In my present state, I cannot guarantee that I can fight without getting you involved Captain… They both appear to be stable now They’ll… Isane, we must be vigilant If we had been even a little later with our treatment, their lives would’ve been in danger And, this place is Hueco Mundo We are right in the middle of the enemy base There’s no telling what might happen, so we must be cautious R-Right This Spiritual Pressure! It’s Captain Kuchiki’s! It’s not only Captain Kuchiki Captain Kurotsuchi and Captain Zaraki have also begun fighting Yes The three of them have their Spiritual Pressure at full strength from the very start The Arrancar… The Espada are that sort of enemy Will they be all right Let’s have faith Then, when they are done fighting, we will heal their injuries That is our job You’re quite tough You too Where is all that brute strength coming from Captain Kuchiki, what is that! Captain Kuchiki! C-Captain Kuchiki! What are you—! Hado 1… Sho! The ice… Stay back, Hanataro Yamada R-Right! I see R-Rukia! Rukia! You immediately discarded not only your left leg, but your left arm as well You instantly regarded the objects whose control was taken away from you as your enemies and slashed them Even if they were your own body So fierce An icy cold decisiveness toward yourself However, that decisiveness, to my eyes, appears slightly imprudent Rukia, get a hold of yourself! I’ll treat your wounds right now! Of your four limbs, only your right arm and right leg remain You are indeed overly arrogant to challenge me, an Espada, with only one arm and one leg Don’t you agree As I told you… Between you and me, our powers are as different as heaven and earth This talk is tedious I discarded my left arm I discarded my left leg Even then, we are still far from equal How unfortunate You appear to have even less of an understanding of your own abilities than I thought There was one thing I forgot to tell you These eyes of mine control one object per eye I’m glad you realized what that means so quickly Earlier, I released Amor using two eyes In other words… Rukia, you just have to – hang on a little longer – In addition to your left arm… I have control of something else I am able to control one area per eye However… If I control the head, control extends to the entire body My control is not affected by the person’s injuries Don’t move! Throw down your sword, nameless captain You have lost Bakudo 61… Rikujokoro What is this! Damn! Move! Move! Move! Damn! Damn! Move! Control, you say Such a thing… holds no meaning at all against me Bankai… Senbonzakura Kageyoshi W-What is this! Curse you… Damn this! I will control everything using the Amor of my entire spirit! Forget it You can control one object per eye That’s what you said The number of eyes on your body, including your own two, is fifty With just those fifty eyes, which of the hundreds of millions of swords covering the sky do you intend to control You told me it was useless That there was nothing I could do Let me tell you something now The state you are in now… That is what you call “useless” Damn it! Move as I command! Move as I command! Gokei, Senbonzakura Kageyoshi W-What! That guy, Zommari, resembles a pumpkin Your captain wears a tube of fishcake on his hair Pumpkins and fishcake are both foods They are equal Fishcake is a processed food It is on a different level than pumpkins Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers There seem to be fewer carp lately"
" Ichigo and friends entered Hueco Mundo to rescue Orihime Inoue, but one by one, the powerful Espada took them down Running out of options, they were shocked to find themselves being saved by Soul Reapers,  who were supposed to have pulled out of this battle What is this You look like you’re about to die Kenpachi! For crying out loud… I said I could handle this by myself No one listens! So you finally attacked We have only come to heal everyone’s wounds We have no intention of fighting with you I will, after all, just eliminate you It would be a waste of time to ask your name You think so On the other hand, it would be a problem if I don’t hear your name Why is that Why Are you an idiot That should be obvious So when I stuff you in a jar, I can write your name on it So as a show of respect to you I think I will ask you your name… so that you can become my marionette This is bad! Those feathers are… Captain Kurotsuchi! Byakuya faced Espada Number 7, Zommari Rureaux And under Zommari’s power of “Amor,” which takes control of everything he sets his eyes upon, Byakuya gradually lost control over his body However, Byakuya’s disdain remained unshaken, forcing Zommari to change his mode of attack He turned his attention on Rukia, who was unconscious following her battle with Aaroniero Zommari took control of Rukia’s mind, and subsequently, her entire body And he used Rukia to cut down Hanataro Yamada, who was trying to render emergency first-aid Furthermore, he resorted to a cowardly move that Byakuya could not fight back against Don’t move! Throw down your sword, nameless captain You have lost Bakudo 61… Rikujokoro What is this! Damn! Damn! Move! Control, you say Such a thing… holds no meaning at all against me Bankai… Senbonzakura Kageyoshi W-What is this! Curse you… Damn this! I will control everything using the Amor of my entire spirit!

Unforgivable! Bakudo 81… Danku W-What is that It is a protective wall that completely rejects any Hado techniques under number 89 I was able to stop Rukia using Rikujokoro Therefore I ascertained that your power is similar to Kido It seems I was not wrong Damn! Now accept my love! Accept it! Accept it! Accept it! Your impatience limited your field of vision You’ve tarnished your self-proclaimed title  as the fastest Espada Show me some mercy What’s with that look You’re going to refuse Will you kill me You’ll punish me! Such arrogance! You still don’t understand! Did you ever stop to consider! The futility of the lives of those whom you kill so righteously! Have you thought about the meaning of killing Hollows like us as though it was a natural thing! Soul Reapers kill us Hollows as though it were a common and reasonable thing! Do you think you are gods! Under whose authority do you kill us Hollows! Is it because we devour humans It’s a fact that we devour humans! So who has been given the right to protect humans! Did someone give you that right! The answer is no! No one has given you any such right! You label us as evil and try to get rid of us That’s because you decided arbitrarily that justice is on your side! Your arrogance! That smug look! You… You… When did I say… that I would kill you because I’m a Soul Reaper I’ll kill you… simply… because you pointed your sword at my pride B… Banzai! Banzai! B-Banzai! Lord Aizen! Lord Aizen! Banzai! It’s over Come on out Isane Kotetsu Did Captain Unohana send you Yes We sensed from his Reishi that Seventh Seat Yamada had been seriously injured She sent me to assist I see Take care of them How very disappointing A captain at this level… You are helpless before my power Master Mayuri! No way Not Captain Kurotsuchi too How unsightly for a captain! That venomous outward appearance is just for show Why you… How dare you do this to me! You’ll pay for this! For someone who holds the rank of captain, you are such a disappointment Why… you… Master Mayuri! I never imagined that I would die in a place like this It’s over Master Mayuri!

Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn! Why! I smashed your organs and your muscles! So why aren’t you dead! Just what is your power! You’re such a loudmouth It’s not a power It’s just that your power is boring already That’s all What! You there, Quincy… I have a very cautious nature When I fight someone, I always lay a trap during the battle I infect my enemy’s body with infinite quantities of surveillance bacteria What! Through the bacteria, I was able to observe every battle you had Therefore, just before coming here, I created replicas of every single organ and muscle tendon That’s ridiculous! Not even an hour has passed since I revealed my power! There’s no way you could do that in such a short time But I can That’s why I’m here W-Wait! What You talk too much! Talk too much!  I just said one word! Bacteria! When did you infect me! During that battle! I don’t recall hearing that! How much did you observe anyway! I hope you’re not watching our daily lives too! That’s against human rights! Remove the bacteria now! What’s with you anyway! And stop looking like that! Are you listening to me! Silence, you fiend FIEND He said it before I could! You’re the fiend! You… Stop it, Ishida Don’t talk! Don’t stop me, Abarai Come on, is that something you have to ask now If not now, then when This is bad! Careless, huh, so-called captain! You didn’t pay enough attention to your subordinate’s foothold It seems you are under the wrong impression You can capture me, but I won’t be a hostage Silence! I’m not speaking to you! Are you listening, so-called captain! I’m speaking to you! My goodness… Everyone keeps chattering It’s so noisy! Bankai Tear him up… Konjiki Ashisogijizo! What is this! Just where did it… What is this! Wha—! This gas… Is it some kind of bacteria! Damn! I can easily counteract this What! Damn What’s with this poison! Impossible! Damn! If I only had time, I could… Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn! Isane Kotetsu, why were you hiding I heard the Arrancar confessing its love to you sir, so I… Isn’t it embarrassing to have someone witness a declaration of love I don’t understand a thing you’re saying Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! I came to help you eat the sweets you received for your recovery! Ukki, aren’t you bored from sleeping all the time Well lately, the carp in the pond have gotten quite big So it’s not boring anymore It’s the opposite in my house Lately, the large carp have dwindled and my brother has been quite troubled by it That’s too bad"
" One by one, Ichigo and his friends fall before the powerful Espada Then captains of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads, under orders from Head Captain Genryusai Yamamoto, appear before them After arriving in Hueco Mundo, each captain begins to battle the Espada Byakuya Kuchiki takes on Espada Number 7, Zommari Rureaux, who tries to use Rukia, who has been knocked unconscious by Aaroniero, to deliver a blow I’ll kill you… simply… because you pointed your sword at my pride Lord Aizen! Banzai! Meanwhile, Mayuri Kurotsuchi fights a difficult battle against Szayelaporro, who uses a doll with which he can control the five senses It’s over No way This is so easy, that it’s boring! I thought there would be more to it than this! Yeah right What! Mayuri had observed Szayeaporro’s strategy, and as a defensive measure against the doll, he had made replicas of his internal organs Furious, Szayelaporro switches tactics and uses his long tentacles to grab Nemu as a hostage My goodness… Everyone keeps chattering It’s so noisy! Bankai Tear him up… Konjiki Ashisogijizo! This gas… Is it some kind of bacteria! Damn! Thank goodness! You’re conscious! Lieutenant Kotetsu Hanataro Why are you here Oh, your treatment isn’t completed yet! Please lie still She’s right You can’t get up yet Brother…Byakuya! Silence Didn’t you hear Lieutenant Kotetsu’s instructions Lie still until they’re done Brother… Your overcoat It doesn’t matter You’re wounded! I said don’t bother Right now, rest and wait until you are healed completely In order to be prepared for the real battle that lies ahead of us Not bad For a Soul Reaper I don’t like it You still have room for talk I said to get serious and attack! Most would avoid being cut by this Then it wouldn’t be fun Besides, I said to get serious! What kind of cut is this! Keep talking! That was good That attack wasn’t bad at all So you’re not just about brute strength That’s got nothing to do with it The sand interfered with my swordsmanship, that’s all Is that so! Kurosaki! Inoue…help… Right! Hang on, I’ll… Not me First… Please heal Nel All right! I’ll heal her right away! I can hear… I can hear it It’s still continuing The battle of the ruffians Can you see that, Abarai I-I don’t want to see it at all, but I’m seeing it It ate him! I can see that Quit describing something so sick! What! You asked me if I saw that! I was just responding to you! But you don’t have to describe it to me! Abarai! The poison has infected you too! What W-Why are you okay That poison has already infected me once I’ve probably developed antibodies Not fair! How can that be! Why only me! What’s not fair! I almost died once! Well, whatever… Hurry with the antidote! Hey Mayuri Kurotsuchi! Ishida! How can you be so carefree It’s common sense to change the mixture of a poison after every use W-Why you… Don’t strain yourself It’ll make the poison spread faster Developed antibodies Not allowing that to happen is what makes one skilled Never mind that! Just give us the antidote! Otherwise… Didn’t I tell you to calm down Umm…Master Mayuri… I’m sorry May I ask you to help me untie this Hey! You heard her, right Why don’t you help her out! You’re so irritating Here’s the antidote Hey! Don’t throw it! Hey! The bottle cracked! What’s happening Something’s odd Hey! Mayuri Kurotsuchi! Hurry up and untie her! W-What is that Did you think you killed me That voice… Szayelaporro! I shall tell you The ultimate, the most exalted power of my La Lujuriosa is known as “Gabriel” It is the power to regenerate by using the enemy itself The power to infiltrate my foe’s body and absorb Reishi from within Well, it’s probably more correct to say replace In order to regenerate, the cells are reconstructed This reconstruction requires all the Reishi inside the enemy’s body to be overtaken so the target is killed off… to bring forth the rebirth Now then… Let’s start over with the self-introduction… Mayuri Kurotsuchi That monster! Did you understand this, Mayuri Kurotsuchi This is how I continue to be reborn into a new existence The phoenix is said to be immortal When it grows old, it hurls itself into flames, and from the flames it is reborn as a new life Understand This is what immortality and perfection means! It’s not about transcending death It’s about incorporating death into the cycle of life One whose existence is not interrupted by something such as death One such as myself, who repeats the continuous cycle of death and rebirth! That is what you would call a perfect being! The demise known as death does not exist for me Even if you kill me, I will rise again before a definitive death Understand this I cannot be killed You cannot defeat me Not in an eternity Mayuri Kurotsuchi Captain Kurotsuchi M-Master Ma…yu…ri… I’m very sorry What’s the matter Are you in a daze from seeing your dear second-in-command about to die You’re quite sensitive, aren’t you Give it up She doesn’t have long Let’s see If I were to categorize it, she’s like the leftover cocoon after the butterfly flies off How interesting How nice Such an amusing power It arouses my curiosity And Is that all What It’s not, is it You went on saying the “perfect being” There must be another power you’re hiding, isn’t there What the hell kind of guy is he Don’t look so serious What’s wrong with telling me It won’t diminish you Don’t be stingy, show me See Do you think that anyone who eats me will stay normal If I’m eaten, my innards will dissolve to infiltrate the target’s nerves! I don’t know how your Zanpakuto is constructed, but if I take over the nucleus of its driving force, construction doesnt matter! Even this thing called Bankai becomes subject to my will! Curse yourself! Because your Bankai took the shape of a living creature! Wha—! My, my… Did you think all would be well if the tool defied its master I modified it to self-destruct in the likely case of it turning against me It seems… you have no other hidden power Well then, you can be my test subject for a new drug I’ve developed You don’t have to be on guard W-What’s he doing I dunno That drug has been administered already His speech just now… There are several drugs already placed inside Nemu’s body If Nemu is devoured, or if her body is infiltrated they are released to her foe What! What drug is it! The place where you passed through had this hidden inside Relax It’s not a poison Let’s see… You can call it a “Superhuman Potion” Superhuman Potion In a battle between two masters, the swords seem to come to a halt You’re familiar with that, aren’t you It’s a prolonging of your sense of time When your senses are stretched to the limit, such phenomena occur This drug maximizes that condition In other words, it’s a drug that allows any person to easily experience that superhuman sensation What is this He’s speaking so slowly… that I can’t understand Can you understand me, Espada With this drug, even to a child, a bullet looks like it has stopped To a superhuman like you, the actions of an average man like me must be so slow and boring Now then… Does this sword look like it has stopped This is the amazing thing about this drug A master’s senses are sharpened only at the instantaneous moment when both swords cross with one another But this Superhuman Potion can enhance that sensitivity by several times… no, several thousand, several trillion times The usual dosage of this drug is one drop diluted 250,000 times But I made it special for you It’s pure and undiluted Right now, one second seems like a hundred years to you In other words, as this sword gets closer to you, with your superhuman sensitivity, the movement looks very slow, like it’s going to take several hundred years How wonderful And while your senses are heightened to superhuman levels, your non-superhuman body falls heavily behind In other words, the body cannot keep up with the movements caught by the exponentially sharpened senses Even if you try to stop it with your hands, it will take several hundred years before you can feel this blade pierce through your hand I’m talking like this, but who knows when my words will reach you But, no need to panic Take your time to thoroughly enjoy the sensation of your heart being pierced by my blade until your dripping fluids turn into sand And so, I bid you adieu until a hundred years from now How did you infiltrate into the body Through the pores This woman’s pores are quite enlarged She really needs to take better care of her skin Nemu, didn’t I tell you to use the same cosmetics as me I’ll sew up every one of your pores!

" Under orders from Genryusai Yamamoto, the captains of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads come to rescue Ichigo and the others, who had fallen to the powerful foes, the Espada Each of the captains who came to Hueco Mundo throw themselves into the battle against the Espada Mayuri appears before Ishida and Renji Despite having Nemu taken hostage, Mayuri swallows Szayalaporro using Konjiki Ashisogijizo He thinks he has defeated Szayelaporro, but Szayelaporro is still alive He succeeds in reviving himself by invading the body of his captive, Nemu, and sucking out her Reishi How interesting How nice Such an amusing power It arouses my curiosity And Is that all It seems… you have no other hidden power Well then, you can be my test subject for a new drug Ive developed You dont have to be on guard That drug has been administered already His speech just now… Szayelaporro, who had come back to life through Nemus body, has been drugged without his knowing The drug is a Superhuman Potion, heightening the senses to the extreme, making instantaneous movements appear as though they have stopped tNow then… Does this sword look like it has stopped Right now, one second seems like a hundred years to you In other words, as this sword gets closer to you, with your superhuman sensitivity, the movement looks very slow, like its going to take several hundred years And while your senses are heightened to superhuman levels, your non-superhuman body falls heavily behind In other words, the body cannot keep up with the movements caught by the exponentially sharpened senses Even if you try to stop it with your hands, it will take several hundred years before you can feel this blade pierce through your hand But, no need to panic Take your time to thoroughly enjoy the sensation of your heart being pierced by my blade until your dripping fluids turn into sand And so, I bid you adieu until a hundred years from now So long… How many years, how many decades, has it been since then No, its been longer At any rate, an immense amount of time has passed When on earth… When will this sword… pierce my heart! Hurry Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry… Hurry up and kill me! The perfect being, is it In this world, nothing perfect exists Though its so cliché It is the truth Which is precisely why ordinary men are infatuated with perfection and pursue it But I ask… What is the meaning of being perfect Nothing Not one thing I despise perfection If something is perfect there is nothing above it There is no room for imagination No space for intelligence or ability Do you understand To men of science like us, perfection is…hopelessness Be more wonderful than anything that existed before you, but never perfect Scientists must be creatures who always agonize over these conflicting concepts, and search for joy in that In other words, the instant you said a crazy word like perfect, you had already lost to me That is, of course, if you are indeed a scientist H-Hey… Is that okay Your Zanpakuto is broken Its not broken I broke it You broke it! As long as the hilt remains, it can be remade Breaking once is fitting punishment for a sword that disobeyed me Nemu! Come here! Nemu! Good grief… She sure is a handful What are you…planning to do – She recovered! – She recovered! H-How! Where in your movements did you cure her! What You cant even understand something that obvious and easy, scum Theres no way we could! Just now, you did something that you couldnt show the audience! Something I cant show the audience That couldnt be You people were watching with your minds in the gutter Well, never mind Explaining my techniques to ordinary people is just a waste of time That was a blatant dodge Ishida! Are you all right! Dont get too excited! What! What do you mean, excited! I was simply speaking along the lines of good public decency! Im stunned that you talk about me like a wicked pervert! Youre mistaken! What I wanted to say is that even if the poison is gone, our organs are still crushed, so we have to be careful The way you said it was misleading! Calm down… Nobody thinks of you as a four-eyed pervert Who are you calling a four-eyed pervert! Man, you guys are so stupid and arrogant Youre really messing up my seasoned reasoning skills Nemu, dig up this place again Yes, Master Mayuri – Ta-da! – Ta-da! – Two out of the – Two out of the – Three Great Desert Brothers! – Three Brothers of the Burning Sands – Back in business once again! – are back in business! This time, weve come back in style! Wait, wait, wait Calm down! Weve met once before! Remember! Were on your side! – On…your…side! – On…your…side! Youre in the way While youre at it, dig them up too Yes, Master Mayuri Wait! Okay, okay! We get it! I cant blame you guys for not knowing who we are since we arrived in the middle of everything! All right, well kindly explain once more Lets do that! I know who you are You should be dead, right Thats cruel! Its true, but its not! Thats right! Whoa! Whoa! Watch it! Watch it! Whoa! Oh, hey! All right, goodbye everybody! Whats this door! Why is this the only place intact after everything has collapsed Thats obvious When a scientist builds his own laboratory, he builds one place more sturdy and secure than any other That place… is neither the room where his costly equipment for his experiments is located, nor is it the archive where he keeps the papers he wrote through the night The thing we do not want destroyed more than anything else is the storeroom where we keep the research materials that we went crawling to the ends of the world to obtain This is… You see Did he get him! Dont make me keep repeating myself! My Hierro is the hardest in a long line of Espada! Theres no way a Soul Reapers blade could cut through it! Stop it! Let go of me! Whatre you going to do to me! – What, you ask – Let go! – Isnt that obvious – Let go! Im going to fix you! REBUILD Youre making a mistake! Thats not healing, thats rebuilding! I knew it! Crap! Let me go! Your squawking is annoying You really are a lily-livered fellow Come on, give it some thought Im saying Im willing to heal your wounds for free Its only reasonable to say a word of gratitude regardless of how your looks or appearance end up as a result Ill do no such thing! You mean you were planning to go as far as to change how I look Please dont move Too close, too close, its too close! What is Oh! Very good, Nemu! Suffocate him just like that! Its okay if he goes into cardiac arrest! This will make it a little easier Captain Kurotsuchi… What is it Please start by healing me first! Why I want to fight as soon as I can There are Espada where the others are as well I need to rush there and assist them Theres no need Huh The only one whos dragging on the fight is Zaraki, who went to Ichigo Kurosakis location Theres no need to help such a riff-raff And Im sure youre aware Stepping into a battle zone is like raw meat thrown before beasts If you get in their way, youll be eaten as well Death by being eaten by beasts is about as stupid a way to die as there is Dont you think You dodged Dodging means you felt threatened Am I wrong It would seem that even though you said a Soul Reapers sword cant cut me, there are areas that can be cut Stop your nonsense! Dodging an attack is a fighting instinct! Its a natural reflex to defeat the enemy! There is no place you can cut! Your sword cannot cut me! Thats all there is to it! There are many types of people in the Soul Society Ive come across annoying guys like you who say, your sword cant cut me on several occasions But… I still havent met someone whose eyes and throat cant be cut! How many times are you going to make me say it until youre satisfied You cant cut me! Kenpachi! You cant understand it, can you Its impossible for someone whos had his head run through to not be dead Isnt that what youre thinking Youre exactly right Bastard! Thats where his… No one survives when their heads been run through But, I am alive You get it, Soul Reaper Your sword hasnt run through my head It simply passed through my head Do you understand That was the limit of what you could do, Soul Reaper We have to rush to Master Nels side!

" Ichigo and his group had been defeated by the formidable Espada when the captains of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads arrived Under orders from Head Captain Genryusai Yamamoto, they came to Hueco Mundo to engage the Espada in battle Kenpachi, who appeared in front of Ichigo, battled Espada Number 5, Nnoitora Gilga The battle between the two warriors, who both find joy in fighting strong opponents, gradually increased in intensity However, Nnoitoras Hierro, boasted as being the hardest among all the Espada, could not be cut despite repeated attacks Kenpachi searched for somewhere to cut even as he was being pressured by intense attacks Your sword cannot cut me! Thats all there is to it! There are many types of people in the Soul Society Ive come across annoying guys like you who say, your sword cant cut me on several occasions But… I still havent met someone whose eyes and throat cant be cut! How many times are you going to make me say it until youre satisfied You cant cut me! You cant understand it, can you Its impossible for someone whos had his head run through to not be dead Isnt that what youre thinking Youre exactly right Bastard! Thats where his… It simply passed through my head Do you understand That was the limit of what you could do, Soul Reaper What the hell are you laughing about! Sorry about that I was just so happy that I couldnt help but laugh Happy, you say Yeah Its no fun if Im not only unable to cut you, but you wont die if I cut you either But at least now I know that if I cut you, youll die And thats enough Now I can look forward to cutting you! I told you, you cant cut me! Idiot! You still have quite a bit of power left Kenpachi is… taking the fight to him! Yup! This is how it should be! Idiot! How many times do I have to tell you You cant cut me— He finally cut him! Zaraki! Whats the matter Are you surprised now that you were suddenly able to cut me But dont get the wrong idea because of one lucky strike Kenny is finally acting like himself again Kenny is just getting started! What is…that Spiritual Pressure! Whats the matter, Inoue Come on, one more round Come at me Dont get carried away! Kenpachi! Damn it… It seems… Im finally getting the hang of your hardness Getting the hang of Did he say, getting the hang of! Does he think he can cut me just with that Ive been a bit out of practice of late My muscles shrank, and I seem to have forgotten how to control them Thanks! Thanks to you, I got a good warm up Let me return the favor… with this! Damn it! Kenpachi! Look out! Incredible! No…way… Fool… You ripped off my eye patch, so I wasnt able to hold back What is up…with that… eye patch…of yours It was a seal A seal I kept a seal on my Spiritual Pressure with this eye patch and kept it under control So I could savor the fight Youre still standing Are you alive Or is it just that you havent died yet You idiot! Im not…going to die! Not by the likes of… the likes of your sword! The wind… An immense Spiritual Pressure is gathering Kenny… I… I… I… I… Im not going to die! Pray, Santa Teresa! His arms…theyve doubled Thats not fair! And his wounds…have closed Youre kidding me Those were wounds inflicted by Kenpachi after taking off his eye patch! Kenpachi! Hey… Hows it feel to see an Espadas sword release for the first time Say something, Soul Reaper! Nice Spiritual Pressure Its been a while since its felt like my blade is being sharpened by Spiritual Pressure! Is that so Then try and cut me with that so-called sharpened blade! What Is that all youve got That cant be! Kenpachi… Ken…ny… That sword had nothing behind it, Soul Reaper! Hes out cold Is it over Oh well, I guess Ill clean up the leftovers Yachiru! Wait, Inoue! What was that! Was I just repelled! That ability… Did Inoue have that among her Shunshunrikka! Santenkesshun! Huh Whats that Youd better look behind you Kenpachi! Thats one arm to start Damn you! Careful If you attack me, Kenny will get angry! Im not angry, stupid! So you were playing dead That was low Shut up! I was thinking If youve got four arms, any of them could block my sword Thats no fun I was trying to figure out how I could keep you from blocking me But…I thought about it, and I couldnt come up with any good ideas Thats why…I decided to cut off each of them one at a time If you cut them all off, he cant fight, Kenny What! Youre right I made a mistake Ill leave one arm Youll leave one arm Whats with that! How stupid Dont worry about it That arm was the last one you could cut off No, to be more accurate… Huh! Youll end your life, killed by these four arms, without ever having cut even one of them off Because youre… weaker than me, Soul Reaper! Youre a lightweight! Getting blown around like that! Youre terribly hard to hit with my attacks! Or are you afraid and simply running away! Huh! Damn it! Whats the matter Youve had enough already You fool Didnt I tell you You cant cut off a single arm Youre just going to be slashed to death by these six arms! Kenpachi! Kenny… Its a wonder you two didnt get lost in the Garganta, Yachiru Byakki smelled very sweet, so we just followed that That must be… Yeah, his Ambassador Seaweed bean paste cake Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers Please! Iba! What brings you here so suddenly Ive heard that animal programs are popular in the World of the Living! Can you do something to get – the captain on one of those shows – Now… Lets do it to improve Squad 7s popularity! What! You mean… CUTE! Something like this, right Oh my! I think its a different kind of popularity I must say, its quite a fine program – What! – What! "
" Ichigo and his group had been defeated by the formidable Espada when the captains of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads arrived Head Captain Genryusai Yamamoto had ordered them to go to Hueco Mundo And each challenged the Espada to a battle Byakuya and Mayuri had won their battles, but Kenpachi was still locked in a fierce match against Nnoitora Nnoitoras Hierro was considered the hardest among the Espada, and Kenpachi was facing an uphill battle, as he was unable to cut through it However, upon seeing Nnoitora dodge an attack, Kenpachi realized that he can be killed and relishes the fight Nnoitora overreacts and attacks Kenpachi with his full force, and cut off his eye patch Fool… You ripped off my eye patch, so I wasnt able to hold back Are you alive Or is it just that you havent died yet I… Im not going to die! Pray, Santa Teresa! What Is that all youve got Whats the matter Youve had enough already Damn… Six…arms! Its over…Soul Reaper Kenpachi! You cant! He said so This is Kennys fight You heard him, Itchy! You cant interfere Kurosaki! Isnt this great! This is awesome! This is how it should be! Its over, you say! Ive finally gotten a hole myself and now Im even with you! All right, lets get started… Espada! What is this! Im the one cutting him! Hes the one who is bleeding! And yet, hes… No matter how much I cut him… He keeps coming back! Im the strongest! The strongest! Im the strongest! Youre an eyesore! Just hurry up and die! Kenpachi! At this rate… I will really die, huh Kenny… I dont enjoy…dying Cripes… I have no choice Its been awhile, but I guess… Ill try some Kendo What did you say When I first joined the Thirteen Court Guard Squads the old man pigeon-holed me and made me do it No good! No good! It just wasnt for me Kendo, the way of the sword It sounded so smug, I didnt like it and didnt use it But there was one thing I did like about it Did you know They say the sword is mightier when swung with both hands rather than one Huh What the hell are you saying Isnt that…pretty obvious! Nope, its not Come at me! You dont know, do you Just how much… stronger… it is Has he given up Hes just standing there like that! Im the strongest! I am the strongest! Has he given up Hes just standing there like that! Im the strongest! I am the strongest! Youre still alive Unbelievable Youre one strong dude Damn… See ya W-Wait! What Stop bugging me Where are you going! Its not over yet! Are you stupid It ended, just now Im under no obligation to finish off a guy who can no longer fight Is that so Then all the more reason Its not over yet Because I…can still fight! Whats the matter Say… something… You scared! Answer me! Are you scared of me, Soul Reaper! What a pain Oh well… Come at me! Why The annihilation of this colony was not part of your orders Why did you massacre them Shut up No one told me not to kill them either Lord Aizens orders were to find the Vasto Lordes Mass killing goes against his orders Not everyone approves of Lord Aizen The ones coming at us are elements of the rebellion Killing them benefits Lord Aizen, dont you think Was it really for the sake of Lord Aizen Didnt it seem that way to you Besides, if I could kill them off, they couldnt have been Vasto Lordes I think that goes along with following orders Youre just overreacting because one or two hundred Hollows were killed Think hard before you speak, Nnoitora Of those Hollows, we just happened to be fortunate enough to evolve past that stage You still disapprove Then come at me If you think you can beat me You amaze me Youre still a child Even after becoming an Espada What! Wait! You… I wont lose! Theres no way I can lose! I… I… Why Why did you save me I didnt save you I simply stopped you from  your suicidal actions to  prevent a shortage of Espada Nelliel… I dont like you You should know that too So why do you follow me around Because… you are weaker than me Quit joking around Every one feels sorry for me Dont they realize that only rubs salt in my wound! Ill show no mercy! Whether someone is strong, or whether theyre weak Whether someone is a mere child, or a beast Ill kill them in one blow! So that theyll never have the strength to stand up again Im… Im… Nnoi…tora I was born to fight Being pitied by others is a sign of weakness! Nelliel, Im stronger than you in every way! ARRANCAR ENCYCLOPEDIA Arrancar Encyclopedia Were talking about Nnoitora today The secret to Nnoitoras strength lies in his Hierro, said to be the hardest in the history of all Espada With it, he can defend himself against powerful attacks His Resurrección is called Santa Teresa SANTA TERESA It seems he can produce a sickle from his arm How about a corkscrew or a bottle opener, I wonder Wouldnt that be convenient! Do you wanna get killed! "
" Ichigo and his group had been defeated by the formidable Espada when the captains of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads arrived Head Captain Genryusai Yamamoto had ordered them to go to Hueco Mundo Captain of Squad 11, Kenpachi Zaraki, came to Ichigos aid and engaged in a fierce battle with Espada Number 5, Nnoitora Gilga After his eyepatch was cut off, Kenpachi unleashed his power In response, Nnoitora did his sword release and took on his Resurrección form With six arms, Nnoitora repeatedly lashed out at Kenpachi, and seriously wounded him But no matter how much blood he lost, Kenpachi laughed, reveling in his joy of fighting Unnerved by Kenpachis eerie laugh, Nnoitora lost patience and attacked even harder With deep wounds that bled profusely, Kenpachi was unable to counter Then he senses his impending death And finally, Kenpachi made his move Youre an eyesore! Just hurry up and die! Kenpachi! At this rate… I will really die, huh Kenny… Cripes… I have no choice Its been awhile, but I guess… Ill try some Kendo Did you know They say the sword is mightier when swung with both hands rather than one Huh Isnt that…pretty obvious! Nope, its not Has he given up Hes just standing there like that! Im the strongest! I am the strongest! W-Wait! I give up! I-Its my loss What You want to say something Whats wrong with killing the loser Even though its a fellow Arrancar, you say Of course Isnt it obvious Its because were both Arrancars that I killed him Listen up… If you intend to follow me, then remember this Pity wont save a comrade Im… Im saying I dont want to fight you I cant see any purpose in fighting you Sure, theres a purpose Fighting itself is my purpose I dont understand Why are you so desperate to fight Because I want to die I want to die in battle Thats why I get strong If Im strong, people will come to me looking for a fight And Ill be able to live and breathe fighting Thats an addiction Youre right Even the best drink tastes like water compared to a fight In our existence, theres no such thing as salvation That doesnt change, whether Aizen is here or not If Im grateful to him at all, its for making me more powerful Thanks to him, Ive been able to experience higher levels of battle I will become strong Stronger than anyone else If Im going to fight the strongest foe, there cant be anyone else stronger than myself Im gonna crush them… with whatever method necessary Ill be cut, and breathe my last before I fall Thats how I want to die That was a blast, Nnoitora Kenpachi… Kenpachi H-Hey, are you crazy You… Kurosaki! Whatre you doing! Pick up…your sword After you pick it up, take the women and go home Your job is done Well take over from here W-Whatre you saying! Ive come this far! Im also… What are you Youre a Substitute Soul Reaper Your job is to protect that town Isnt that so You rescued that woman You should be satisfied If you understand, go home Besides, youve already had your share of fighting Woman! Y-Yes! Heal my wounds! Y-Yes! Sorry… I dont usually enjoy doing troublesome stuff like this, but… Let me borrow her for a bit They disappeared Welcome back… Orihime Whats the matter You look awfully troubled Smile Everyone will be sad if the sun doesnt shine Smile and wait here for a while That is all you need to do Just until… we erase Karakura Town Erase…Karakura Town Yes I will destroy Karakura Town to create the Ouken Kaname… Yes, sir The Tenteikura Yes, sir Bakudo Number 77… Tenteikura Can you hear me, my guest of intruders That voice… Aizen! They are using the Tenteikura I commend you for defeating the Espada thus far And I shall reward you by telling you this We will proceed with our invasion of the World of the Living What! It cant be! I thought there would be no invasion until Inoue awakens the Hogyoku! Where is Inoue now! Orihime Inoue will be kept in the Fifth Tower If you wish to rescue her, come and get her She is no longer of use to me What! Did he say, no longer of use! Her powers are amazing Her power to reject all forms of phenomenon exceeds all  bounds of human potential The higher-ups of the Soul Society understood the importance of that power That is why her capture would be a threat to them, and they took steps, not to protect the World of the Living, but the Soul Society itself We now know that the Arrancar are ready for battle All the members of the Hitsugaya advance troop are to return immediately and defend the Soul Society And her presence was enough to become the bait to lure in the Soul Societys potential new military strength The Ryoka, which included the Substitute Soul Reaper Damn it Furthermore, I succeeded in imprisoning the four captains who came to assist them here in Hueco Mundo The four Garganta that we passed through to get here… have all been sealed! What! Cant we open it up from this side! Not possible The only one who knows how the Garganta works at this time is Kisuke Urahara As long as theres no way to contact him, opening it up again is impossible As much as I hate to admit it The magnificence of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads lies in the thirteen captains all possessing the power to stand as a military strength all on their own But now, three have defected and four are imprisoned It can be said that the military power of the Soul Society has literally been cut in half It will be so easy We will destroy Karakura Town, create the Ouken, and overthrow the Soul Society I shall take you on, leisurely, after all this is done Destroy…Karakura Town! Hold it, Ichigo Where are you going What do you think you can do now Then what do you suggest! Karakura Town is in danger! You expect me to sit and wait for that to happen! Didnt I tell you The Old Man gave Kisuke Urahara a set of orders to carry out once he knew the final battle was gonna come in the winter The first order was to send the captains to Hueco Mundo The second order was to get every officer… of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads that is at captain-level ready for battle in Karakura Town The second order was to get every officer of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads that is at captain-level ready for battle in Karakura Town Then the Thirteen Court Guard Squads are… Yes, they should have arrived by now Thats crazy! To fight in Karakura Town… The power of all the captains fighting there… What would happen to Karakura Town! It will be totally leveled to the ground Remember, he said ready for battle That was his order Just increasing the number of captain-level men does not signify being ready for battle He meant Tenkaiketchu It means to reconstruct Karakura Town to make fighting possible there In order to do that, Kisuke Urahara constructed a device called Tenkeiketchu, connecting four pillars to form a giant Senkaimon with a radius of one Spirit Mile And he placed it around the four corners of Karakura Town At the same time, he asked my Dept of Research and Development to construct an elaborate replica of Karakura Town in the outskirts of the Rukon District Now, what a headache that was But we pulled it off The Tenkaiketchu differs from a Senkaimon in that it can switch what it encircles with something in the Soul Society In other words, by utilizing this, we were able to transfer the real Karakura Town directly into the outskirts of the Rukon District What about…the residents We put them to sleep and sent them all to the Soul Society along with the town What you see out there now is merely a replica of Karakura Town thats completely devoid of people Even if the captains do battle, even if the town is destroyed… It wont matter at all It seems we made it in time Made it in time Now why would you say that Im well aware that what lies there is not Karakura Town But that means nothing to me Stark, Barragan, Halibel…come If Karakura Town is in the Soul Society, well just kill you here and create the Ouken in the Soul Society Thats all there is to it Until then… I will leave Las Noches to you… Ulquiorra Yes, sir Kenpachi… You said earlier that protecting Karakura Town was my job, didnt you Youre wrong My job…is to protect my friends Come… Ichigo Kurosaki! Kurosaki, I got an invitation to Rurichiyos kemari festival! What Werent we gonna talk about the Soul Reapers past in the next episode That can wait until after the tournament!

" I…chi… Morning, Keigo! How did you… I hadnt even said anything yet Yo, Mizuiro! Good morning, Ichigo! A pretty quiet morning, isnt it I guess Stop! Did you see what just happened! Why are you ignoring it Why wont you mention it! Come to think of it, there was someone here to see you, Ichigo Someone to see me It has been a while, Ichigo! Things are nice and easy over here as always No one is around to scold you even if you play kemari A far cry from life at the mansion I envy you Did something happen to you Huh Why are you here And all alone It is up to me where I go And if something did happen, you would help me, Ichigo Stop assuming things on your own I have things to do here, myself Where are Kenryu and Enryu Arent they with you I do not know about Kenryu!

There is a good reason for this I have class, so Im going! Hey! Wait I say! Whats the big idea! That hurt! I said listen to what I have to say! Cool your head a bit Ichigo, you jerk! Yes! Its lunchtime! Ichigo! What could todays main dish be! If youre looking for Ichigo, he already left What! That was way too fast! This has gone way past just blowing me off! By herself! Yeah… Looks like neither Kenryu nor Enryu came with her Then why did she come here Im guessing she got sick of living at the mansion and ran away, maybe So, wheres Rurichiyo now Beats me That hurt You fool! Although the trouble in her clan is over, shes still the princess of a noble family! What if something unexpected happens to her! Something unexpected An inner tube! What we need is an inner tube! How did you come to the conclusion of needing an inner tube Well… Out of frustration, Rurichiyo arrives at a certain pier and jumps into the world of the fisherman… Inoue! Sounds like itll take a long time to explain, so stop Oh, okay At any rate, lets split up and find her before anything terrible happens – Right! – Right! Guess I dont have a choice Did you find her Man… Even though she became head of the clan, her knack for causing alarm hasnt changed True But… She may have become head of the clan, but shes still very young We cant even imagine how heavy a responsibility that must be Its enough to make her seek relief in the World of the Living We must not waste any time Lets look for her again! – Right! – Right! Whats going on Ishida! Ishida! Rurichiyos nowhere to be found! Any idea where she might be An idea My, my, my, my I was wondering when you would come to pick her up, Kurosaki! I had a feeling you would surely come soon, so I didnt contact you, but what took you so long Umm… No, I… We…umm…just came to… Why didnt you think of this place first Come on, lets go! I do not want to! I am staying here! I do not want to go with that orange-headed man! Youre still saying that! If you keep on being unreasonable, youll… I am telling you to leave me alone! You know thats not possible Why not! Im saying youre causing everyone trouble by coming here on a whim! Youre the head of a noble clan, you know! Yes, I am a selfish head of a clan who knows nothing of the world! Whats gotten into you! Be quiet! I do not need your… Whats that! Youre in a bad mood because youre hungry That was not me! I assure you, I am not hungry Sorry… You heard that So it was Inoue That was superb timing Im hungry Want to go and eat something That one…was me That was delicious You cannot get meals like this unless you are in this world Is my after-dinner tea not here yet You there, waiter! Bring me my tea! Rurichiyo! You dont have to yell Shes sound asleep If only she were this quiet when she was awake as well Sorry for being so loud You were awake! Well…things must be tough for you too I do not particularly need your sympathy Sorry I left you alone Whos there! – Kenryu! – Kenryu! Lady Rurichiyo! Leaving the clan and coming to the World of the Living is an outrage! What were you thinking! Now wait… Give her a chance to explain Was my scolding you about the kemari so hard for you to take! No, thats not what it was… She… That is right! Huh What about kemari is so wrong! As I said! We have a mountain of things we should do before playing kemari! That is for me to decide! Just a minute! Is the reason you came here… – Kemari! – Its kemari! That is why I keep telling you! Right now, having a pastime like kemari is important! I have told you repeatedly, until I turned blue in the face… With the people alienating themselves from us now, our priority is to repair relations with the leaders of other noble families! I do not know about such things! I am the head now! I will do what I believe in! That will not do! Just a minute! Just this once, calm down! How can I calm down! Ichigo, do something about this pigheaded guy! Ichigo Kurosaki! You understand how I feel, dont you! Well, Ichigo! Ichigo Kurosaki! Oh for crying out loud! Suit yourselves Then are you saying that you oppose what I say no matter how many times I tell you, Kenryu! Of course! We are about the only ones who can persuade that stubborn head of yours! Did you just call me stubborn! However, this is my duty! This resolve will not change, even if it means I incur your anger or your distaste in me! I never liked you from the start! In fact, I hate you! I hated you from way, way back! If you cannot obey me, then leave! Very well Excuse me Kenryu! Hey! Hey, wait! Rurichiyo! I do not care What! Now its Kenryu whos missing People connected with the Kasumiohji Clan appear to enjoy causing a commotion But Rurichiyo didnt seem much different from her usual self – Over here – Pass, pass, come on! They are pretty bad Found you! Whatre you doing here Oh dear… Sorry about that That hurt Shes good! My skill is awesome, is it not Yeah… I mean thats not it! Doing this isnt going to solve anything! That incident is at the root of everything Ever since that incident, the domain of the Kasumiohji Clan has been unsettled, and public safety is steadily growing worse The people have lost their energy and spirit because of anxiety and distrust We are responsible for all of this That is when I came up with the idea of a kemari festival! I recalled seeing something similar in the World of the Living I thought we could make the people happy with this So, together with Shu, I worked out a plan, but… What are you saying, Lady Rurichiyo We are telling you this for the good of you and the Kasumiohji Clan! I am the head of this clan! Let me do as I wish! That will not do! I will keep on saying it until you understand! That Kenryu would not listen to my plan at all! I thought the head of a clan should do what she believes is right, but it is a bit tiresome So you see, Rurichiyo has her reasons If we explain to Kenryu, wouldnt he listen to what we have to say But the way Kenryu looked, just trying to tell him is going to be a lot of trouble First of all, theres no way we can tell Kenryu if we dont know where he went Well, yeah, youre right Where in the world could he be – Ichigo… – Huh I see Lady Rurichiyo said that Yeah, well… Rurichiyo wasnt really serious when she told you to leave Cant you accept what shes saying Its difficult Its true that right now, Lady Rurichiyo is focused on the people Regaining the trust of the people and rebuilding the House is important too But I believe that in order to restore the Kasumiohji Clan, we need first to mend our relations with other noble families and people with power, and work in tandem with them to govern Its a matter of priorities! One day, we will be able to have the type of government that Lady Rurichiyo is seeking But right now, we dont have the luxury! We must do what we must do! That, above all, is for the good of the people It sounds like… neither of your views are wrong Whatre we going to do about this Youre asking me What to do Its entirely my fault that I have not been able to convince Lady Rurichiyo Since its come to this, I will offer my life in exchange Just a minute! Just a minute! Dont stop me, Ichigo Kurosaki! I must take responsibility! Never mind! Dont rush things! Calm down for a minute! Dont stop me! I said stop! Kurosaki, let him go What Ishida! Its what you would call compassion towards a warrior Well watch him end his life and report it to Rurichiyo What B-But… Kenryu, go right ahead I will assist if you wish Only, I will be using an arrow rather than a sword Very well Excuse me Rurichiyo! Here you are! What is wrong You look pale Its Kenryu! Did you find him Where was he! He…says hes going to commit suicide! What! So what What Kenryu already left! It is not my concern what happens to him! Is it all right to say such a thing! You made him protect you in every way, but you wont consider protecting him! Fine! A-Are you all right! Thank you, Ken…I mean Enryu! Thank you Kenryu! Do you think it will work What are you talking about! Wasnt this the plan you came up with Yes it is, but… Kenryu, go right ahead I shall assist if you wish What am I to do Good grief, how melodramatic can you get Im not being melodramatic If Lady Rurichiyo still does not change her mind, it is my duty to stop her, even if it means taking my life I found you people as I was considering that thought and wandering about the town So you werent just nearby by chance Im begging you, Ichigo Kurosaki! Help me out! Well, this might be the best way to persuade his master You think so Oh, here she comes! Quickly! Okay! Everything ready Rurichiyo! – Over here! Over here! – Dont do it! – Hurry! – Kenryu! Dont be a fool! Dont be hasty! Let go of me! Let go of me, you guys! Are you telling me to live with this shame I would rather die! You moron! L-Lady Rurichiyo… You really are a moron! Do you really think doing that is going to make me happy! B-But… Protecting my retainers is my responsibility I cannot let you die! Is that understood Then, Lady Rurichiyo… They sure are a handful Youre telling me My, my… I guess I will have to give in just this once I am so happy that you understand I wont have to lose my life for something as silly as kemari As silly as kemari What do you mean by as silly as Are you finding fault in my idea! No…I…you know… a mere pastime like kemari is… A mere pastime! Umm…no, I mean… I have decided not to give in after all! What! You just said you would agree with my view And who is the one who stepped all over those feelings This is hopeless And everything was going so well with everyones cooperation What! Cooperation – Oh man… – Oh man… So all this talk about committing suicide was to deceive me! Unforgivable! Unforgivable! Absolutely unforgivable! It cant be helped now that you know! At any rate, kemari is out! You dont understand because you have never done it! I have, thats why Im saying this! I can do something like that better than you, Lady Rurichiyo! If you are going to talk like that, let us have a kemari competition! We shall settle it with this! Let us say the loser never says anything again! I wouldnt have it any other way! How do things get this way! Lady Kuchiki, please accept this as a small token of goodwill from one noble family to another Pardon me, but I cannot W-What! This is the elusive golden Chappy! I went through great pains for it Thank you So what is your request I will hear you out Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! Let me tell you about this place, Ichigo This is my favorite optician Huh GINTONBO Glasses by Gin… You cant read it I thought you said Japanese was your best subject Wait…Ill have it in a second… The radical for insect, so its the name of a bug, right Want a hint Its a bug that conjures an image of glasses! Oh! Gin…Namekuji as in slug! Slugs dont make you 	think of glasses! SLUG "
" Rurichiyo, princess of the Kasumiohji Clan, a high-ranking noble family of the Soul Society, was supposed to have returned to her mansion as head of the clan once the internal strife had been resolved However, Rurichiyo appeared once again in the World of the Living Rurichiyo, who wanted to hold a kemari tournament in order to cheer up her subjects, had a difference of opinion with Kenryu, who believed that mending relations with other noble families and the people in power was more important, and Rurichiyo ran away from home Kenryu, however, felt responsible for being unable to persuade Rurichiyo and decided to commit suicide When she became aware of this, Rurichiyo realized how important Kenryu was to her, and stopped him from committing suicide You moron! L-Lady Rurichiyo… You really are a moron! Do you really think doing that is going to make me happy! Protecting my retainers is my responsibility I cannot let you die! Is that understood Then, Lady Rurichiyo… They sure are a handful Youre telling me My, my… I guess I will have to give in just this once I am so happy that you understand I wont have to lose my life for something as silly as kemari As silly as kemari What do you mean by as silly as Are you finding fault in my idea! No…I…you know… a mere pastime like kemari is… A mere pastime! Umm…no, I mean… At any rate, kemari is out! You dont understand because you have never done it! I have, thats why Im saying this! I can do something like that better than you, Lady Rurichiyo! If you are going to talk like that, let us have a kemari competition! We shall settle it with this! Let us say the loser never says anything again! I wouldnt have it any other way! How do things get this way! So were participating in this thing too Dont complain, Ichigo Kurosaki Consider it an honor to be able to participate in a noble familys kemari competition Youve got nerve saying that when you forced us into it But whats with these teams! Sorry, Ichigo I couldnt refuse on account of our relationship as nobility I was your enemy from the start Ill always be together with Rukia! Thats how it goes Good grief… This team looks like were short a member Whatll we do Im glad you noticed, Ishida One of us, whose duty is to admonish Lady Rurichiyo, has betrayed us Unlike Kenryu, Enryu is always on my side! The truth is, I want to be on the same team as Lady Rurichiyo too That Enryu… Well, anyway… I suspected this might happen, so Ive readied a powerful helper! Yoruichi! Youre as good as home Leave it to me! I asked Urahara Shop to help me find the best helper! The Kasumiohji Clan is a major customer, so I have to treat them accordingly Thats how it is, so thanks for your help, Yoruichi! Mr Urahara! Why are you here too! Didnt I tell you Our store is the top sponsor of this competition! URAHARA SHOP PRESENTS ULTIMATE SUPER 	KEMARI CHAMPIONSHIP 	IN KARAKURA TOWN We have arranged for the referees, as well How do you do Im going to watch you very closely, so be ready for it! You cant be serious We will now explain the rules Miss Kuchiki Yes Kemari is a peaceful ancient sport of Japan played using a ball Players kick the ball in the air to a set height without letting it fall to the ground PEACE by passing it Those are horrible drawings, as usual KAKARI All you do is keep kicking the ball 	within the open space marked by trees called kakari 	at each of the four corners The rules are extremely simple In essence, its a game where keeping the ball up and assisting each other are important But then thered be no end And thats why… For this competition, were using a special Kasumiohji Clan rule! Ahem! Its nothing all that difficult The side that drops a pass loses The referees will make the decision Do you understand, Lady Rurichiyo Of course! If you win, Kenryu, I will obediently return to the Soul Society and do what you say If I win, we will hold a kemari tournament Is that okay with you! Thats fine Though there is no doubt I will win Will it really go as you think For this competition, weve marked the entirety of Karakura Town with kakari For the duration of the 90-minute time limit, weve set the conditions to be identical to an Area Freeze and Konpaku Protection, so please do not go outside the kakari What do you mean by time limit If we keep it frozen for too long, the Soul Society will reprimand us Is it okay to do that Men shouldnt worry about details! Shes right Its much easier to put all your effort into it if theres a time limit rather than letting it drag on without a resolution! No doubt Umm… If everyones ready, well begin Kickoff You put too much strength into it! Oh yeah! Lady Rurichiyo! What do you think of that! Thats nothing! Whoa! Both team captains are going at each other from the very start! All right! Lets do it, Ichigo! Got it! You can count on me! No, you dont! Missed Thats dangerous! I forgot to mention that its okay for those without the ball to obstruct the opposite team Say that at the start! What are you doing, Ichigo! Damn! Uh-oh! The balls about to go outside the kakari! This is where I come in! Everyone might have forgotten, but I am a Mod Soul, a reinforced leg strength model! Kon Kick! Hows that! I said no going out-of-bounds! Kon went out-of-bounds and was blown away by referee Jintas attack! Therell be trouble if the Soul Society finds out that the barrier is being used as a kakari To keep it a secret, they must not go outside the barrier Thats right! Its that idiots fault for going out-of-bounds on his own! Therell be trouble if they find out Why the hell are we taking so many risks here Got it! Kuchiki, Im passing it to you! I am not going to let you! Come on, Enryu! What the—! A nice play by Enryu! Daichimaru is a defense-type Zanpakuto that can flip the mats around in any location Even if there are no mats, it can block an opponents attack by hardening the surface and standing it up What do you think of that! Whyre you shouting all of a sudden Because Enryu is embarrassed to have others hear his voice What good is it going to do to scare your teammates! Kurosaki! The ball! Chad! Pass it here! Go easy! Ichigo! Go after it using Flash Step! Guess Ill have to! Yoruichi! I wont lose to you in a contest of speed! Well see! Im limited in this form Okay! Made it with time to spare You underestimate me if you think you can overtake me with such a slow Flash Step, Ichigo! Put your clothes on! Looks like Yoruichi transformed! No…problem Its his fault for getting caught off-guard! Lady Yoruichi! Pass the ball here! Oh fine Take care of the ball while I put my clothes on! Whatre you doing! Sorry… I think I used too much strength Sotenkishun! Good job, Orihime! Did you see, Kenryu! Our teamwork! Thats nothing! The real contest starts now! The way its going, I wont ever finish Ruricchi and Kenryu both went to the World of the Living and havent come back I wanted to go to the World of the Living too Lord Shu! I brought more documents! Theres still more Well, about that… What! Ichigo! I know! Wait, Kurosaki! Santenkesshun! Inoue! Kurosaki, now! Thank you, Inoue! No, you dont! Come on, Kon! Dance, Sodenoshirayuki Whatre you going to do, Sis Sorry Grit your teeth! What Tsuginomai… Hakuren You! That was brilliant, Miss Kuchiki! My nose is bleeding You must not go outside the kakari! Bakudo Number 99 Part 2: Bankin! My body! After all, we are doing this without telling the Soul Society, so… And I keep asking why you all are eager to do something illegal! Whats this about keeping something secret from the Soul Society Yo! Whats all this commotion about, Ichigo Ikkaku! Umm…well…its…umm… There have been some strong adversaries lately, so Im retraining Ichigo Special training… Is that it Yeah… You came at the right time! Someone got injured a while back Will you lend us a hand I dont know whats going on, but it seems interesting Substitution! Madarame taking the place of Kon! Hey, wait! We wont agree to that! Umm… We will allow the substitution What! I see you liked the candy made by the candymaker from the Kasumiohji Clan You are a sneaky one, Kenryu Not at all Im no match for you, Mr Urahara Its been a while since Ive taken you on! On guard, Ichigo! Is this for real! Wait a… Dont hold back, you! Why you… Fine! Now the real fight starts! Extend, Hozukimaru! What does Kurosaki think hes doing, not bothering to kick the ball Beats me Hang in there, Kurosaki! Looks like everyones forgotten the original intent Thats a big problem Does it really matter You really are persistent, arent you! Back at you! Lets put an end to this contest already! Im telling you that if you admit youve lost, itll be over! Restoring the clan as soon as possible is whats important Ive told you repeatedly that providing recreational activities can still be done after that Why wont you understand! Not yet! Lady Rurichiyo… Why are you so determined to… Thats obvious! Because I want to see smiles on everyones faces! Ever since I returned to the mansion, everyone has been giving up sleep to work hard on restoring the clan But there are still many things that are too difficult for me, so in the end, I am putting a burden on you and the others Thats… I know! It cannot be helped because I am still a child! Still… I thought very hard, wondering if there was something I could do! Some way that I could make my subjects, the staff at the mansion, and you smile I thought my very hardest! Lady Rurichiyo… A Hollow! Did we exert a bit too much Spiritual Pressure! This isnt good! Run! Lady Rurichiyo! Shake, Daichimaru! Lady Rurichiyo! Lady Rurichiyo! Please get away! No! Im not leaving you behind, Kenryu! – What – Huh! Getsugatensho! Lady Rurichiyo, are you hurt No, I am all right By the way, what about the kemari ball When the Hollow attacked, it went somewhere Which means it fell on my turn So this contest is… Is this…the Senkaimon! Oh, here you are! Shu! Why did you come to the World of the Living, as well I wanted to show this to you Ruricchi These are letters from your subjects Remember you once mentioned you would hold a kemari tournament No details were released for the longest time, so we received many letters from everyone See, look! Isnt that great, Ruricchi Your idea wasnt a bad one, after all! Everyone is looking forward to the kemari tournament! I see But…the kemari tournament… Lady Rurichiyo… There could be no more definitive outcome to the contest It is clear for anyone to see that I lost We will cooperate with all our effort to put on the tournament! Kenryu! Enryu! Thats how it is! I have preparations for the kemari tournament that I must attend to, so I must return immediately Sorry for causing a commotion Ichigo Kurosaki, weve put you through a lot Farewell! H-Hey! So in the end, what was all this! Starting in the next episode, were going back in time 110 years Im embarrassed to say this, but itll feature me when I was very young Huh!

" The pendulum swings back Our story, which has progressed deep, deep into the future will stop temporarily and turn back to the past for just a short time And so, with frightening speed, we must go far into the distance It must be known And yet, it must not be known There, we will find the truth of the mask Good morning!

" One hundred ten years ago… At that time, the Thirteen Court Guard Squads had different members, but there were some very familiar faces The captain of Squad 5 was Shinji Hirako who currently resides in the World of the Living as a Visored Other Visoreds also held positions as captains and lieutenants Furthermore, Aizen was the lieutenant under Hirako in Squad 5 At that time, Squad 12 captain Hikifune was promoted to the Royal Special Task Force and left her position open Yoruichi Shihoin, who was the captain of Squad 2 at that time, personally recommended the Third Seat in her squad Huh Umm… Dont tell me Im the last one Im sorry Im late And… Nice to meet you all Jeez… Looks like we got a pretty loose one this time Like you should talk Umm… May I enter Dont act like a wimp! Youre now a captain! Stand tall and enter, Kisuke! R-Right Yes, be quick and enter! Now… We shall proceed with the installation ceremony Im sure the rest of you captains have heard Seven days ago, Squad 12 Captain, Kirio Hikifune, was ordered to relinquish her position due to a promotion elsewhere As a result, a search had begun for a new squad captain, and notice was sent to other captains The following day, upon Squad 2 Captain Yoruichi Shihouins recommendation, the Third Seat from her squad was summoned And yesterday… I, Genryusai Yamamoto, along with the three captains who were present, conducted an exam to evaluate his qualifications to become a captain We found no complaint in his abilities and character Therefore, former Third Seat of Squad 2, Kisuke Urahara is promoted to captain of Squad 12 Umm… And so… Im your new captain Nice to meet you Nice to meet you I wont accept this!

If this goes on, our squad will be known as the hangout for losers! Although I dont accept you as the captain, if youre someone who would get angry at criticisms of Squad 12 then show me what youve got! Fine However… How about we do this with our bare hands No need to use our Zanpakuto Spar with the lieutenant without weapons Thats so reckless All right! Here we go! Go ahead You can attack me from any direction Come! Hes so weak He didnt even have time to dodge – Captain! – Are you all right! That guy… He totally read my move! And yet, well aware that he would get hit, he moved back Could he have done so to spare me embarrassment from the others Why What kind of man is he I dont get it As expected… You seem bored Oh, Captain Hirako… Just call me Shinji Were both captains What do you think of Hiyori A pain in the butt No… She was close to Captain Hikifune… thought of her as a mother Itll be hard to win her over Youre right I want us to get along, but… Its just not going as smoothly as my predecessor Are you being truthful about that I dont like to act like I know it all But hear me out as one whos been captain a bit longer than you Those who rule…can sympathize with those who serve, but they must not show it Do things the way you like And if no one follows, then you just werent the right vessel to lead them And besides… You dont look the type to be much good at thinking about how others feel Well anyway… Dont let this bother you too much You and I seem to share something in common and I couldnt help but be a busybody Night How long are you going to stand there and watch…Sosuke Im impressed How long have you been aware of me From the time you were in your mamas womb Lets go Yes, sir Captain What is it Youre a frightening man, after all Thats my line Yoruichi… Its just as you said Being a captain…looks like fun W-What… What the hell is all of this! Oh, good morning, Hiyori Just where do you think this is, you! This is the captains room! The captains room! You cant just go and do your own renovations! Its okay I mean, its my room What! Besides, its not a renovation I just did a little rearranging How is this rearranging! Theres absolutely nothing of the old room left! It doesnt have to be right away Just a little at a time… Just try to understand me… a little at a time And Ill try to understand you… a little at a time, Hiyori Okay No way! Oh yes… I have a favor to ask of you, Hiyori W-What is it I want you to come with me right now to the Maggots Nest Maggots Nest! A sad voice resonates deep within Seireitei An ominous shadow beyond the gate Next time, the young girl sees! A cursed labyrinth spreads underground The mystery of the Maggots Nest! Dont miss it! What the hell are you talking about Is that supposed to be a promo for some sort of suspense-horror movie Substitute Soul Reaper Work Journal! The Combat Pass certifies that one is a Substitute Soul Reaper SUBSTITUTE SOUL REAPER COMBAT PASS A Hollow Dont use the Combat Pass so freely! Or youll have trouble dealing with the body after you transform into a Soul Reaper If you use a Soul Candy, you wont even have to leave class! Kon! Take care of the rest! You can count on me! Take that! Sorry, Ichigo What the hell did you do "
" One hundred ten years ago… As a result of high turnover among the captains of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads, a new generation was about to take over As part of the changeover, Kisuke Urahara, filled the empty post of Squad 12 captain at the recommendation of Yoruichi Shihoin, who at the time, was captain of Squad 2 However, Hiyori Sarugaki, lieutenant of Squad 12, had a strained relationship with Urahara, due to the dislike of his history in the Stealth Force and his laid-back personality W-What the hell is all of this! Just where do you  think this is, you! This is the captains room! The captains room! You cant just go and do your own renovations! Its okay I mean, its my room What! Besides, its not a renovation I just did a little rearranging How is this rearranging! Theres absolutely nothing of the old room left! Oh yes… I have a favor to ask of you, Hiyori W-What is it I want you to come with me right now to the Maggots Nest Maggots Nest! Okay, were here This is the place Huh Kisukes here Yes! He said he already had your permission, Lady Yoruichi What was it now What should we do If you do not recall, shall I have him leave No, that wont be necessary Take him wherever he wants to go Did you remember Not at all Lady Yoruichi! What now Soi Fon Dont be so noisy But… No need to worry Knowing Kisuke, he came here for a reason Oh… It opened, it opened Shall we go in I dont want to! Now, now, dont be like that I dont want to! Come on, lets go I said I dont want to! – Now, now… – Let go of me! When you go in, who knows, you might think, – Wow, its wonderful! – I said let go! I thought we were going to some creepy place called the Maggots Nest Were inside the Squad 2 Barrack grounds! Youve heard of the Stealth Force, havent you, Hiyori Stealth Force Well of course I have Its your old unit, idiot! Stop changing the subject! STEALTH FORCE Stealth Force It is an organization whose origins are separate from the Thirteen Court Guard Squads As one of the four great noble clans who possess incredible Soul Reaper powers, the Shihoin Clan serves as the supreme commander to this force And whenever the head of the Shihoin Clan becomes a captain of a Thirteen Court Guard Squad, the squad they lead has a tendency to become closely associated with the Stealth Force So that means, what Yoruichi, the current supreme commander, concurrently serves as captain of Squad 2 That means the current Stealth Force becomes much like an organization under the direct control of Squad 2 The Stealth Force is divided into five units, and each unit leader is also a Seat Officer of Squad 2 I was the leader of Unit Three, Confinement Troops Then you were a yard hack No…I was a prison guard My main duties were to imprison and watch over those who committed crimes inside the Seireitei So that made you a yard hack, right I was a guard Same thing! Your job was to swagger about in front of the criminals, right! The Confinement Troops had another duty as Special Confinement officers Huh Special Confinement officer Our job was to investigate, apprehend and keep under surveillance Soul Reapers joining the Court Guard Squads whose ideas and actions would either put other Soul Reapers at risk, or posed a threat by obstructing the squads duties I dont understand what you said! You have a confusing way of saying things! Say it in simple terms Simple terms! In other words, my job was to catch and lock up dangerous elements within the Thirteen Court Guard Squads That facility is located here, in Squad 2s barracks The facility is on the northwest side of these grounds, beyond the huge 54-meter-wide moat The Underground Special Confinement Station Also known as  the Maggots Nest What is this The inside is nothing but a huge cave Did you really keep people locked up in here In this underground prison It does sound cruel, doesnt it But it isnt really an underground prison See They are not allowed to leave this place However, their activities within the facility are not restricted Please be careful Sometimes someone will attack all of a sudden What on earth did these people do Nothing As I told you… These people havent done anything wrong They are people who were determined to be dangerous elements according to the criteria of the Seireitei Theyve committed no crime, so we cannot try them However, left free, they may be dangerous That is why we keep them confined in here Whats that about! I dont get it! They havent done anything, and yet you… Hiyori… Up until now, have there been any among your peers who resigned from the Thirteen Court Guard Squads Huh Theres been a couple, but… what about them The truth is, there is no system that allows members to resign Those who have no choice but to leave the squad for personal reasons are on Squad Leave If it does not seem likely that they will be able to return to the squad for an extended period of time, it is considered an Expulsion We do not recognize leaving the squad by ones own choice What Resigning means they are placed under special confinement Squad members who are reported to have resigned are all sent here for confinement Why go through all that trouble The Thirteen Court Guard Squads is a noble organization It must never produce any unsuitable members from among those who were once accepted into the organization That is the philosophy of Central 46 that rules the Seireitei That is why unsuitables who might become dangerous elements are dealt with in utmost secrecy as deserters Hiyori… Something has been on my mind ever since I was assigned here as unit leader Yes, the people here are all dangerous people But I was thinking there are many people here whose risk could be turned to a huge good if we could only provide them an environment where they could put their abilities to use Which is it! Youre keeping them confined because theyre dangerous elements, right But now, youre talking about putting their ability to use Hiyori! Is that you, Hiyori! Big Mouth! Hes one of my peers whom I thought had deserted He always used to talk big and boast about things he couldnt even do, like one day being in charge of the Seireitei, so everyone called him Big Mouth Hiyori! Hiyori! Help me! Youve got to help me! We were classmates, right I want to go home! I want to go home, you know! Shoot! I left my sword in the barracks Im sorry I knew you forgot your sword, but I kept quiet Bringing weapons into the Special Confinement Station is forbidden Thats why it is an absolute  requirement that leaders of the Confinement Troops be able  to subdue everyone unarmed How sad Have you forgotten my face after just two or three days After I took such good care of you Damn it! Get them! Seems you all have really forgotten me How cruel Dont move! Listen! I want you to get me out of here right now! If you dont, Ill… Big Mouth Youve taken the wrong person as a hostage Dont mess with me, idiot! His big mouth just got a lot bigger Good grief… Shall we go, Hiyori What sort of environment are you talking about thatll make these guys useful! Theyre really dangerous elements! If you bring these guys outside, youll just increase your problems! Now, now… In any case, lets get going Take a look Beyond here is the only dangerous element in this place in solitary confinement You mean someone even more violent! What business could he have with someone like that Is that you, Kisuke Urahara What brings you to a place like this I came because I needed to see you Kurotsuchi Mayuri Wont you leave here with me Who…is this dude Oh… You called someone you met for the first time dude Quite a disrespectful boy, I must say Boy! Who are you calling a boy! Im a girl! You want me to show you my boobs! Freak! You look like a weird boiled dumpling! – Please forgive her foul mouth – See! She is my squads… Come on and take a good look at these! Lieutenant – Lieutenant… – You see that! – You were promoted – Hey! Im telling you to look at these, you idiot! – Congratulations – Hello! Thanks Getting back to the subject, can I have your answer You mean to your hare-brained idea of leaving here with you Yes No thanks Okay then! Lets go back! If this dude doesnt want to leave, wed just be wasting our time by staying here, right Why not I am satisfied with my life here I have no need to leave That couldnt possibly be true Not in this place where theres nothing to do Then let me ask you… Why do you want to get me out of here Because I need your help Lets dispense with the frivolous lies I could see through that one like an X-ray You got me there I am making you overly cautious, arent I I cannot figure you out You are an unpleasant fellow I believe in your skills That is the truth I am considering creating an organization under the control of Squad 12 unlike anything ever seen in the Soul Society Im calling it the Department of Research and Development I want you to assume the seat of deputy department head What! You want me to work under you Thats correct Its not a bad offer, right Youd be second in command to me In other words… If I die, you would have total control You certainly are an unpleasant fellow Oh, impressive, very impressive Practicing hard, I see, Byakuya Grandfather! You have returned to the mansion Did you come to rest here today rather than at the barracks Yes Im glad you did Its been a long time since Ive been able to talk with you It makes me very happy Yes So, what do you say, Byakuya Why dont you call it a day for practice today I brought someone here to see you Here to see me Youve appeared, cat monster! Cat Monster! Is that what I get for coming to see you, Byakuya-boy And to think I came all this way to visit! Quiet! When did I ever say I wanted you to come and visit me! As the next head of the Kuchiki Clan, I dont need fun and games! Oh, is that so You! It may be just fun and games, but I worry about the future of the Kuchiki Clan if its next head of the House has his topknot tie easily taken away by a girl! Stay right where you are, Yoruichi Shihoin With my Flash Step, Ill… Byakuya Kuchiki! I have beaten you! I see Seems you really want to make me angry Fine Then youll find out for yourself! That my Flash Step has far surpassed yours! Oh good grief… Byakuya would reach a whole new level if he could only get rid of his quick temper Now then, maybe Ill have some tea Thank you That smile of yours is as powerful as always Oh, hot! So about the… Ill say it again, I wont be your lieutenant Dont say it again Youll hurt my feelings even more There are lots of others who deserve to become captain-level before me Are you saying that out of obligation Well, thats so you By the way, have you heard About what Im told theres a prodigy, the first one since you, among this years recruits Im no prodigy This child… He graduated from Soul Reaper Academy in just one year One year! Thats impressive Dont you agree! I think… Captain Kuchikis grandson Byakuya is about that age Oh, that cocky one Yes, that one I think the kids about the  same age or slightly younger I hear a Seat Officers position will be readied for him when he enters the squad That right Looks like weve got ourselves someone with quite a future Thatll make my chances for a lieutenant position even more distant Dont sound so happy about it So, who is it Who gets that new recruit Well…I believe… Hell be joining Squad 5 Nice Your skill is even better than I had heard Tell me your name again Gin… Gin Ichimaru How was our Third Seat Awful No competition at all I see Glad to hear it After swinging toward the past and giving a flash glimpse in time, several more years pass as we move toward the crux of the incident ONE HUNDRED ONE YEARS AGO I want you to be my lieutenant What it means is that if I die, you will have complete control Whats this about, out of the blue I wanted to imitate Kisuke Urahara Howd I do Its not even funny Please stop it Substitute Soul Reaper Work Journal!

" One hundred ten years ago, the Thirteen Court Guard Squads of that day were different from the present, but there were some very familiar faces The captain of Squad 5 was Shinji Hirako, who currently resides in the World of the Living as a Visored Other members of the Visored also held positions as captains and lieutenants in the Thirteen Court Guard Squads At the time, Kisuke Urahara became the captain of Squad 12 upon the recommendation of Squad 2 captain, Yoruichi Shihoin I am considering creating an organization under the control of Squad 12 unlike anything ever seen in the Soul Society Im calling it the Department of Research and Development I want you to assume the seat of deputy department head Kurotsuchi Mayuri At about the same time at the Kuchiki Clan residence, a young Byakuya practiced his swordsmanship At Squad 13s barracks, Kaien Shiba was being persuaded by Jushiro Ukitake to be promoted to lieutenant Each, with their own motives, spent their days thinking of the future of the Soul Society and the Thirteen Court Guard Squads But glimpses of the start of a nightmare were already showing Nice Your skill is even better than I had heard How was our Third Seat Awful No competition at all I see Glad to hear it After swinging back to the past and giving a glimpse of a moment in time, the pendulum swings several years forward The incident occurred nine years after Kisuke Urahara became captain Hey Good morning Oh! Morning, Hirako I said you can call me Shinji Youre such a pain Morning, Mayuri I told you to be less casual and call me Kurotsuchi You are an irritating fellow What a pain in the ass Oh, by the way, have you heard about that story About what Ouch! W-What was that for, Hiyori! All of a sudden! You havent greeted me yet! Whats with greeting the other two and leaving me out! Why do I have to greet you! This mouth! This damn mouth! Oh yes, Captain Urahara, have you already heard Heard about what About the violent deaths in the Rukon district Thats it! Thats what I was talking about! Good follow up, Sosuke! Violent deaths Yeah… In the past month or so, there have been a series of incidents where residents of the Rukon district have been disappearing The reason is unknown Disappearing You mean, they went somewhere and never came back Are you an idiot You call that running away If they ran away, who cares They can do whatever they want But this is different They literally disappear Gone, without a trace, leaving only their clothes behind If they died and became spirits, the clothes they were wearing would disappear as well They didnt die They vanished alive, unable to retain human form Thats the only explanation I can think of Alive, but unable to retain human form Sorry Im just telling you exactly what I heard from Captain Unohana I dont know what it means At any rate, Squad 9 is already there to investigate Hey, hey! Are you listening to me, Kensei What do you mean by unknown Tell me, Kensei Quiet! Unknown means unknown! Quit babbling Whats with you! Theres no need for a captain to go just to investigate something unknown! Its unknown, thats why were going to check it out! An advance party went out! Ten people! You couldve just waited for them to report, but youre so impatient, Kensei! You show off! – Lieutenant, please, youre doing it again – Im sick of this…sick – Captain! Please calm down, Captain! – Stupid Kensei, you show off! – You know shes always like that! – Stupid! First of all, when did I ever tell you to come along! You dont need to come along!

Yes What is it now Please try to be quiet I havent had much sleep, you know Do something about this guy! You havent taught him well! Huh What is that Oh, you mean this Its a prototype of a new gigai You remember what Hirako said this morning About the incidents in the Rukon district where he believes people were unable to retain human form, and their souls would vanish Supposing that what he says is true, I thought that if we were to place a soul that was on the verge of disintegration into a human mold, the soul would not vanish Im trying to see if I could apply gigai technology into making that mold Youre… Excuse me! I am Izaemon Todo, Sixth Seat of Squad 9! Is Kisuke Urahara, captain of Squad 12 here I have come to convey a request from Kensei Muguruma, captain of Squad 9!

Now then… You heard him, so… Hiyori, please go there Why! I dont want to!

" One hundred ten years in the past, and nine years after Kisuke Urahara assumed the post of captain of Squad 12 In the Rukon district, the mysterious deaths of residents who vanished leaving only their clothes behind caused quite a stir among the Soul Society Under normal circumstances, when a person dies and becomes reishi, their clothing would also disappear This fact made the whole incident unnatural The Thirteen Court Guard Squads took this as an abnormal situation and dispatched Squad 9, led by Kensei Muguruma to investigate the incident They headed to the plains that stretched through the Rukon district Blast away! Tachikaze! Kensei! Mashiro… Where the hell did you go during the battle In those bushes! I found this on the ground! See A shihakusho! Ten…shihakusho! It matches the number in the advance party! Judging from the number of shihakusho left behind, Kensei determined they belonged to the advance party sent ahead to investigate He had squad members report back to Central 46 about the first Soul Reaper casualties connected with this incident At the same time, he asked to have laboratory personnel dispatched because of the possibility of an unknown pathogen In response, Urahara sent Hiyori to Kensei Then, that same night… What happened! What is this You… Emergency assembly! Emergency assembly! All squad captains, assemble immediately at Squad 1 barracks! There is an emergency with Squad 9! The Spiritual Pressure readings for Squad 9 Captain Kensei Muguruma and Lieutenant Mashiro Kuna have vanished! As a result, an emergency meeting of squad captains will be convened! Wheres Hiyori! Sh-She left a while ago! – Captain! – Repeat! Emergency assembly! All squad captains, assemble at Squad 1 barracks! I should have gone Sorry about this Hiyori, youre the only one I can confidently entrust a task like this to Im counting on you, Hiyori I never thought this would happen I get the feeling I fell for stupid Kisukes trick I mean, why do I have to help with the work of the Department of Research and Developement in the first place! Thats something Kisuke and that baldy Mayuri should do themselves! But theyre making the entire squad study how to develop new technology What is that We have an emergency! According to reports from Squad 9s camp thats now standing by at the scene, the Spiritual Pressures of both Squad 9 Captain Kensei Muguruma and Lieutenant Mashiro Kuna, who were out in the field, have vanished The cause is unknown! We must consider the possibility that this is a worst-case scenario! What, until yesterday, was simply an incident that occurred in the Rukon district has now become something that we must stake the pride of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads to resolve! Therefore, from this moment, I will select five people of captain class and dispatch them to the scene! Youre late, Kisuke Urahara Let me…go there, please! No My second-in-command is headed there now! – I must… – Kisuke! Youre making a scene Pull yourself together! Didnt you make the choice to send her! Cant you see that your panic is an insult to her! Now, dont just stand there Line up over here I will now continue Captain of Squad 3, Rojuro Ohtoribashi Captain of Squad 5, Shinji Hirako Captain of Squad 7, Love Aikawa The three I just named will head to the site Captain of Squad 2, Yoruichi Shihoin, will stand by for further orders Captain of Squad 6, Ginrei Kuchiki, captain of Squad 8, Shunsui Kyoraku, and captain of Squad 13, Jushiro Ukitake The three of you will guard the Seireitei Captain of Squad 4, Retsu Unohana You will stand by in the Medical Treatment Room to await possible casualties that come in Just a minute, Head Captain If your concern is treating casualties, shouldnt I head toward the scene As long as the situation remains unclear, we cannot risk dispatching the head of the medical treatment unit I will send someone else to the scene Enter Tessai Tsukabishi Its been a long time since he came out into the open… This has sure become a major issue, hasnt it Youve heard, I assume I want the two of you to head to the scene Will do Understood Hey, Old Man Yama Sorry about that But you know I was thinking, without knowing the situation on the front, isnt sending both the Kido Commander and his lieutenant a bad idea Then what would you do I would send my lieutenant in place of the Kido Commander Youre going to summon her now Thats right Hey! Lisa! What is it You see Didnt I tell you that you must not peek into a Captains Meeting I couldnt help it Its human nature to want to see something you keep hidden!

" In the Rukon district, incidences of mysterious deaths occurred among the Soul Society where people vanished, leaving just their clothes behind Squad 9 was investigating in the field when someone attacked them Captain Kensei Muguruma and Lieutenant Mashiro Kunas Spiritual Pressure disappeared The Thirteen Court Guard Squads determined that a worst-case scenario had occurred Urahara, who had sent Lieutenant Hiyori Sarugaki to the scene following the request by the aforementioned Squad 9, tries to go after her, but… Let me…go there, please! No My second-in-command is headed there now! I must… Kisuke! Youre making a scene Pull yourself together! Didnt you make the choice to send her! Cant you see that your panic is an insult to her! Ultimately, however, five members: captain of Squad 3, Rojuro Ohtoribashi, captain of Squad 5, Shinji Hirako, captain of Squad 7, Love Aikawa, Hachigen Ushoda, lieutenant of the Kido Corps, and Lisa Yadomaru, lieutenant of Squad 9, are chosen to go When the members arrive, they are confronted by an abnormal figure Shinji! Shinji! Are you all right, Hiyori! K-Kensei! Whats going on with that Is that really Kensei That mask… That Spiritual Pressure… It is almost like hes a Hollow! Im not sure, either Maybe its Kensei, maybe its not Anyway, whats certain is well die if we dont draw our swords What Shinji and the others saw was Kensei, whose Spiritual Pressure and appearance had been transformed into something resembling a Hollow Kensei, who had lost himself, attacked Reluctantly, Hirako and the others fought back However, Kensei displayed extraordinary power, and when Mashiro, who had also been transformed, joined in, the five gradually began losing the fight Behind you, Rose! Gochu Tekkan Bakudo 63: Sajosabaku Hey! Thank you for your rounds C-Captain Kyoraku! Whats the matter Whyre you out at this hour Well, I had a bit of trouble falling asleep Maybe Im thinking too much – Huh! – Huh!

Im going too! Me too With those injuries Are you crazy I can do it alone You watch my back Show off! Look whos talking! Rose! I know! How solid can he be! Hachi! Bakudo 99! Kin! A Nineties-level Bakudo without an incantation, eh Gotta hand it to you I overextended myself…a bit Okay then What shall we do now Cant you do something using Kido Even if you want me to, if I dont know the cause, theres nothing I can do Whats the matter, Hiyori Are you okay Hachi, heal this one for starters Shin… Shinji… Let go of… me! Hiyori! What the hells going on! Wha— No! This is… Lisa! Rose! Hachi! Youre… Tosen! Why did you do that to Kensei You betrayed him… Your own captain! He didnt betray him He is loyal He just… loyally followed my orders, thats all Please dont hold it against him, Captain Hirako Ai…zen I shouldve known it was you So you were on to me Youre good Of course I am Since when From the time you were still in your mothers womb I see Ive always felt that you were someone dangerous Someone who couldnt be trusted Thats why I chose you as my lieutenant I did it to keep an eye you, Aizen! Yes, I appreciate that, Captain Hirako Thanks to your deep distrust of me, you didnt realize I just told you that I did No You didnt realize During this past month… that wasnt me… who has been following you What! I am able to make someone mistake any phenomenon for something else at will That is the true power of my Zanpakuto, Kyokasuigetsu I refer to its power as… Complete Hypnosis Complete hypnosis, you say! You are a sharp man, Captain Hirako If you had received me as your second-in-command as other captains ordinarily do, perhaps you may have seen through me However, you did not Because you did not trust me, you never got closer than a certain distance, never opening up to me, or giving me information, and never tried to get closer to me Thats why you never realized Even if I switched places with a completely different person I had the man who took my place memorize everything about my normal behavior patterns and my patterns of interaction when dealing with you and other squad members and captains If you understood me deeply, even slight differences in habits or behaviors would have seemed out of place to you You are lying there defeated because you remained totally unfamiliar with me Do you understand now Captain Hirako Aizen… And one more thing Earlier, you said you chose me as your lieutenant to keep an eye on me You are mistaken What! Just as a captain has the right to select his lieutenant, squad members have the right to refuse an assignment While that right is very rarely exercised, I also had the choice of not becoming your lieutenant Why didnt I do that Because it was the ideal situation Your excessive suspicion and wariness of me was truly ideal for my plan Do you understand You did not choose me I chose you, Captain Hirako Maybe you should be apologizing to your friends Because you were chosen by me, you ended up down there on the ground with your friends Aizen… Thank you for going for my cheap taunt Damn it! Youre doing this to me too Aizen! Damn it! Youre doing this to me too Aizen! What is this! As we thought, it looks like an agitated state accelerates the Hollowfication Hollowfication! What is that supposed to mean You dont need to know Sh-Shinji Kaname Yes, sir Stop! I dont know whats going on But if you think everything will go according to your plan, youre gravely mistaken Oh Even though the Hollowfication has progressed that far… Come to think of it, didnt Aizen just say… As we thought, it looks like an agitated state accelerates the Hollowfication Which means that if I maintain my composure, this strange process wont progress! What shall we do You can go ahead and continue Well just have one less sample So Im a sample You say interesting things Looks like hes losing Yeah, it looks that way What is this! I dont know whats happening Am I suffering, or… Its almost as if someone other than me is doing the fighting Its no wonder we had a hard time dealing with Kensei, even in groups But at this rate, I may have a chance! Im sorry I will finish him right now Theres no need to worry, Kaname I expected this to happen Besides… The speed at which Hollowfication occurs differs from individual to individual That was quite an interesting sight But thats as far as you go, it would seem Lets end it, Captain Hirako In the end, remember one thing Betrayal you can see is trivial What is truly frightening is betrayal you cannot see, Captain Hirako Goodbye You people were wonderful test subjects Damn it! Well… What an interesting guest The Past Arc finally comes to an end next week! I get to appear at last! You wish, Ichigo It seems there will be another story following the Past Arc What You mean Youll be stuck in the Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers for some time to come Who is the main character of this anime supposed to be! The Substitute Soul Reaper Work Journal! There are times when we provide a place for Soul Reapers who come to the World of the Living Sorry Im late No problem, we were just about to start Now, with regard to the next activity of the Mens Soul Reaper Association… Whyre you guys holding your meeting here! Theres no meeting hall that the Soul Society will let us use! Please go home "
" With the disappearance of the Spiritual Pressures of Squad 9 Captain Kensei Muguruma and his lieutenant, Mashiro Kuna, the vanishing konpaku case, wherein Rukon district residents vanished leaving only their clothes behind, became a major case involving even the Thirteen Court Guard Squads When Hirako and his group of five who headed to the scene arrived, they saw the figures of Kensei and Mashiro, who had transformed into Hollow-like forms Kensei, who lost himself, attacks Hirako and the others fight back Suddenly however, Hiyori, too, changes form Youre… Tosen! Why did you do that to Kensei You betrayed him… Your own captain! He didnt betray him He is loyal He just… loyally followed my orders, thats all Please dont hold it against him, Captain Hirako Ai…zen Aizen! Damn it! Youre doing this to me too In the end, remember one thing Betrayal you can see is trivial What is truly frightening is betrayal you cannot see, Captain Hirako Goodbye You people were wonderful test subjects Damn it! Well… What an interesting guest What brings you here Captain Urahara, Kido Commander Tsukabishi This is bad They found us I will kill them No, that wont be necessary But… Kaname, I said that wont be necessary Y-Yes, sir! Please forgive my impudence K-Kisuke… Whyd you come, you idiot Whats with that vulgar mask Thats right, say what you want Lieutenant Aizen Yes What are you doing here Nothing As you can see, I just happened to find the members of the investigation unit in charge of the vanishing soul case who were injured in battle, and I was attempting to rescue them You bastard! How can you lie so shamelessly Why are you lying Lying Is there a problem with a lieutenant helping his captain Its not that Thats not whats bothering me Injured in battle You call these injuries You mustnt lie This is a Hollowfication The vanishing soul case… Squad members disappearing one after another as if erased And now, its come to this Those were probably… Hollowfication experiments By someone, you see But given the situation, there might not be any need to bewilder things by saying someone I see You are indeed the man I thought you were Im glad you came here tonight Gin, Kaname… Weve fulfilled our objective Lets go Wait, Aizen! Im not done talking to you Stand clear, Urahara! Hado 88… Hiryu Gekizoku Shinten Raiho! Bakudo 81… Danku Thats impossible A lieutenant stopped my Kido using Danku without an incantation! Forgive me! It seems I let him get away Tessai… What in the world is he Hirako! Lets deal with Aizen and the others later, Urahara! Right now, we need to treat Hirako and his group! But… With the Hollowfication so far advanced, we cant treat him here Urahara, it seems you know something about this matter, which you described with the unfamiliar term Hollowfication If thats so, can I assume that you know how to deal with this as well I do know Although the method is a gamble Understood! Even so, its better than nothing! Well bring all eight of them back to Squad 12s barracks in their present condition With the facilities in the barracks, we can save their lives In this condition! But how are you going to do that By using Time Stop and Teleport What Both are forbidden techniques Their use is strictly banned That is why Id like you to close your eyes and ears for a moment Hollowfication is one of the outcomes I arrived at as I studied how to strengthen the souls of Soul Reapers In the process, I created a material that instantaneously destroys and then creates the boundary between Hollows and Soul Reapers I will use that to treat Hirako and the others What is that material I call it the Hogyoku Hogyoku What is this sensation of pressure Is it Spiritual Pressure No, its not the same It is presence The presence this stone possesses is trying to push away my presence What on earth is this What has Urahara created Can Hirako and the others really be saved using this No Ive already told you The method is a gamble The likelihood that Hirako and the others will return to the way they were by using Hogyoku is, even by a generous estimation, about 20 percent, Id say Twenty percent! If the series of vanishing soul cases was Lieutenant Aizens doing, then Id assume that he never even considered the possibility of a treatment for Hollowfication There is no other way, but this Urahara Im sorry, Tessai It failed I need to go outside to get some fresh air Whats going on Captain of Squad 12, Kisuke Urahara! And Kido Commander of the Kido Corps, Tessai Tsukabishi! A warrant for your arrest has been issued by Central 46! Come with us! What is the meaning of this I dont recall giving you permission to speak You have been summoned here for an inquest You are not to speak other than in response to a question Is that understood, captain of Squad 12 Inquest Am I being suspected of something I apologize Where were you last night shortly after midnight In the forest of District 6 in West Fugai district Were you there conducting Hollowfication experiments Just a minute! Who told you such a thing You tested Hollowfication, the results of your evil research, on the captain of Squad 5, as well as seven other captain-class members in the Fugai district So it is true You are indeed the man I thought you were Who was it You do not have the right to ask questions Was it Lieutenant Aizen That makes twice, captain of Squad 12 The next time, we will add to the charges That was all his doing! We went there to rescue Hirako and the others! When your lies go that far, they become comical The lieutenant of Squad 5 never left the Seireitei last night What! We have the statements of 124 squad members and one captain That leaves no room for any doubt That cant be I have information to report! Numerous traces of Hollowfication experiments were found in the research wing of Squad 12s barracks! That settles it I will pass sentence! Kido Commader Tessai Tsukabishi! For the crime of using a forbidden technique, you are sentenced to imprisonment in Underground Prison 3: Shugo Captain of Squad 12, Kisuke Urahara! For the crime of conducting research on and applying taboo phenomena to deceive and cause serious injury to your fellow squad members, you are sentenced to eternal banishment to the World of the Living after you have been stripped of all Spiritual Power! Furthermore, the pitiful captain of Squad 5 along with the other seven captain-class members, who became the victims of your heinous experiments will be dealt with severely as Hollows! But thats… Just a minute! Who are you! Who gave you permission to enter the conference room while proceedings are in progress! Leave this place immediately, lowly oaf! C-Capture them! Intruder! Someone! Isnt anyone there! Somebody! Th-Thank you Yoruichi You dont need to thank me Ill even save the swift kick I was going to give you for not saying a word to me last night for later I brought all eight of them here And the new Gigai prototype you were working on as well Get started on it From the moment you heard about this incident from Hirako, you envisioned the worst-case scenario And you also came up with the best solution to counter that You saw through everything, I see You are a nasty one Look whos talking Tessai, put a Time Stop on Hirako and the others Then place a double and triple barrier around this place Starting now, for the next 20 hours, you and I will build a total of ten Gigai built with Spiritual Pressure masking function for the two of us, and Hirako and the others What about you, Yoruichi Dont worry about me I can always manage to get away Well lay low in the World of the Living and take our time to solve the mystery We will, without fail, find a way to undo this Hollowfication Kisuke did say, there were no miscalculations That was the biggest miscalculation of all As expected, everything turned out in the worst possible way Man, we sure owe Kisuke… and Aizen too Lets go When evil intentions pervade society, a warrior for hope who operates above the law appears without fail His cape fluttering in the wind is a symbol of justice Career Change! Go, Konso Cop Karakuriser! Next time: Im reluctant, but I will protect the peace in Karakura Town! Watch for it! Substitute Soul Reaper Work Journal! Substitute Soul Reapers sometimes hold on to things for Soul Reapers I came to pick up my Gigai Whyd you leave them at my place Because if I left them at Mr Urahara place, hed make me work for free as payment for holding on to them What in the world!

The other day, someone said Don Kanonji was filming on location for the first time in a while, so I went to have a look I went to his dressing room to ask for his autograph For some reason, Urahara was there talking to him, when one of those strange monsters appeared And then… Look out! Super Spirit Cane! Kanonji defeated the monster Realizing that I could see it, Kanonji said… You have a superb power, boy! And in the end, I became one without knowing how it happened! Gosh, just like me I didnt want to be the only one to have this happen to him, so I tried to get Mizuiro involved, as well But… Count me out, Asano He was quick to run away And thats why Honsho came in his place You poor soul I dont need your pity!

" Aizen had snatched away Orihime Inoue to Hueco Mundo It was believed that Aizen was going to awaken the Hogyoku using Orihimes ability to reject phenomenon The Soul Society responded to this by dispatching captains of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads However, Orihime had only been brought there to lure the captains Aizens true objectives were to create the Ouken by wiping out the Enriched Spirit Zone of Karakura Town, and to take over the Soul Society by force Aizen sealed off the Garganta, the opening that led to Hueco Mundo, trapping Ichigo and the others there He then took Gin and Tosen with him to invade Karakura Town Genryusai, however, saw through his intentions, and ordered Urahara to make the captains capable of fighting in Karakura Town Urahara built a device called a Tenkaiketchu that would act as a huge Senkaimon, and used it to swap the real Karakura Town with a town replica built in the Soul Society It seems we made it in time Made it in time Now why would you say that Im well aware that what lies there is not Karakura Town But that means nothing to me If Karakura Town is in the Soul Society, well just kill you here and create the Ouken in the Soul Society Thats all there is to it Until then… I will leave Las Noches to you… Ulquiorra Yes, sir My job… is to protect my friends KAGAMINO CITY (22 KM EAST OF KARAKURA TOWN) 12:13 pm Are you all right, young lady Oh boy, looks like the Spiritual Pressure got them Man, Im telling you, thats some insane Spiritual Pressure If we dont get the heck out of here, we could end up like them Umm… Your panties are showing, young lady Who are you, mister Huh Me Yeah My name is Eikichiro Saido Im just a petty Soul Reaper who was recently put in charge of this district So youre a petty person Ouch! Thats okay Listen, if you stay here, youll end up dead, like those monsters Get away now while you can Okay Oh boy Looks like its going to begin Well lets see how this contest turns out, good or bad AT THE SAME TIME 70 METERS ABOVE KARAKURA TOWN His Spiritual Pressure is monstrous, just the way I remember it! If it scares you, you can run away Coward Should we go after the leader first No, Aizens powers are very special In order to concentrate our attacks on him, we should defeat those around him first Who do you suppose is the strongest among those three Espada Thats hard to say Wed have to ask Aizen The problem is that while were fighting the Espada, theres no guarantee that Aizen and his men wont interfere Youre right Stand back, everyone Render all things in the universe to ashes Ryujinjakka Get down, Ukitake! I know! Jokakuenjo Aizen and the others wont be able to get past this wall of flames for a while Now then, shall we crush them The Head Captains pretty drastic, isnt he Just goes to show how upset Old Man Yama is Aizen Jeez… Thats hot, hot Head Captain sure went overboard Whatll we do now, Captain Aizen With all this, we wont be able to join in Well do nothing It just means that this battle will end without the need for us to get our hands dirty That is all AT THE SAME TIME LAS NOCHES TOWER 5 Are you afraid Lord Aizen has considered you unnecessary There is nothing to protect you anymore Its over You will die here, all alone, with no contact with anyone Im asking if you are afraid I am not afraid Because everyone came to rescue me My heart is… with theirs Such nonsense You say you are not afraid because your friends came for you Do you really mean those words Yes Getsugatensho! When I first heard that they came to rescue me, it made me a little glad And awfully sad I came here because I wanted to protect all of them Why did they all come here Why couldnt I make them understand I wondered But when I sensed that Kuchiki had fallen, and when I saw Kurosaki fight in front of me, I felt like all of that didnt matter All that mattered was I didnt want Kurosaki to get hurt I wanted everyone to be safe When I felt that way, I realized, that mustve been how all of them felt If someone in that group had disappeared like I did, I would surely do the same thing they did I take it you are the intruder, Ichigo Kurosaki I am Rudobon, captain of the Exequias I have come for your life I said I will have your life You will stop here Sorry, but I dont have time to deal with the likes of you Thats just fine I, too, have no time to waste on you alone! Damn! How many are there! Coming at you one more time! Renji! El Directo! Chad! You fools Letting a minor unexpected turn of events easily get the best of you Tsuginomai Hakuren! Rukia! Idiot! Save the reunion for later! Go quickly, Ichigo! Gotcha Jeez… Hes so high maintenance Do you think you can defeat me with that level of strength You, too, are nothing more than a minor unexpected turn of events This is absurd Your fate and that of your friends is already set Even if your friends come, it wont overturn the fact that all of you will die Sharing feelings with those who are about to die, that is how you humans comfort yourselves It is one of your instincts to help you escape from fear and hopelessness Sharing feelings doesnt exist in the real word It is nothing more than a meaningless illusion you humans have You may be right Perhaps it is impossible to feel exactly the same emotions But by cherishing each other, our hearts can be that much closer Dont die! Dont die, Kurosaki! You dont have to win You dont have to try Just dont get hurt anymore Thats what it must mean to be of one heart Heart, you say You humans use that word so casually, as though its in the palm of your hands My eyes see everything There is nothing they do not see If they do not see it, it does not exist I have fought until now, convinced of that What is heart If I rip open your chest, will I see it inside If I split your skull, will I see it inside Roar, Zabimaru! El Directo! Hakuren! Arent you guys overdoing it a bit We havent appeared in a while! We have to show all we can, or well lose out! Now I feel sorry for the Exequias The Substitute Soul Reaper Work Journal! Hey! Whatre you doing! Its not my fault! The closet is too small! For crying out loud, what do you have packed in here! What are these! They are the Gigai Im keeping for everyone! Substitute Soul Reapers cannot refuse a request for a favor "
" Aizens true objectives were to create the Ouken by wiping out the Enriched Spirit Zone of Karakura Town, and to take over the Soul Society by force In order to foil his plan, the Soul Reapers readied for battle in a fake Karakura Town that they had built in the World of the Living The battle between the Espada and the Soul Reapers had finally begun Stand back, everyone All things in the universe turn to ashes Ryujinjakka Jokakuenjo Aizen and the others wont be able to get past this wall of flames for a while Now then, shall we crush them In Hueco Mundo, countless Exequias stood in the way of Ichigo, who was headed towards Tower 5 to rescue Orihime Ichigo was gradually overwhelmed by the Exequias sheer numbers, when… Coming at you one more time! Renji! El Directo! Chad! Tsuginomai Hakuren! Rukia! Idiot! Save the reunion for later! Go quickly, Ichigo! Gotcha Jeez… Hes so high maintenance Meanwhile, in Tower 5, Ulquiorra and Orihime faced each other Orihime said she was unafraid of dying alone because she shared her heart with her friends To which, Ulquiorra cast his doubts Heart, you say You humans use that word so casually, as though its in the palm of your hands What is heart If I rip open your chest, will I see it inside If I split your skull, will I see it inside Kurosaki Step away from Inoue I was about to My duty is to protect Las Noches until Lord Aizen returns Ive received no orders to take her life Until those orders come, I will let her live However, you are a different matter Killing you is synonymous with protecting Las Noches I shall eliminate you with my sword That was unexpected I didnt think you would draw your sword first I came here thinking that Id have to start by making you draw your sword Can I take it you consider me an equal opponent At the very least, I consider you worthy of destroying Thats good enough for me Kurosaki So, what should we do There are hordes of enemies, while our boss is in that mess Thats no way to speak of Lord Aizen, Barragan And thats no way to speak to me, Halibel Given that the boss is stuck, I will give the orders I wont hear any complaints Whatre you… Be quiet, Mila Rose Sounds good to me Ow! What was that for, Lilinette Ouch! How can that be good! Whatre you kissing ass for! Youre always kissing up – to everyone, everywhere – Quit yakking Try and look good for a change! Are you really taking this battle seriously! The Enriched Spirit Zone beneath our feet is a fake, he said… He said they replaced it with a replica built in the Soul Society Boss said, all we have to do is invade the Soul Society and obtain the Enriched Sprit Zone Is it really necessary to go through all that trouble From what was said earlier, I figure it works like this He said they erected four pillars on each side of the town and used the power of the pillars to swap the entire town In that case, what would happen if we destroyed those pillars Findorr! Yes, sir I know where the pillars are located Its standard practice to place things like that at the four cardinal points This is bad! They know! Whatre we going to do now! If the pillars are destroyed, the Karakura Town that we sent to the Soul Society will come back! The real Karakura Town will become a battlefield! Karakura Town will… Karakura Town will return! You fool! What Do you think I wouldnt assign anyone to such important locations What Extend, Hozukimaru! Bloom, Fujikujaku Raise your head, Wabisuke! Ive stationed capable fighters Huh Huh What! Madarame! Ayasegawa! Kira! Hisagi! You mean they werent holding down the fort back home! They werent around when you had us assembled, so I felt like a winner, thinking you are counting on me instead of them, serves em right That kind of thing! What! You mean, you all knew about this! Of course What! Do you mind not speaking of us like were you What! I did tell you No doubt you were gnawing on fried crackers and missed what I said What! Thats the only explanation! Stupid Omaeda! Come on Its your fault for gnawing on fried crackers in a daze! What! Eating fried crackers and being in a daze arent connected! – Oh yes they are! – Maybe I didnt tell him Four soldiers… So what If there are four pillars guarded by four ants, then well squash them with four dragons Poww Chuhlhourne Abirama Findorr Crush them – Yes! – Yes! – As you command, your Majesty! – As you command, your Majesty!

Thats what I want to ask you! Whats the idea of calling someone you meet for the first time ugly! Ugly! See here!

" Aizen entered the World of the Living to wipe out Karakura Town, an Enriched Spirit Zone In order to stop him, the Soul Reapers took up positions in the World of the Living and constructed the Tenkaiketchu on the four corners of Karakura Town to swap a fake Karakura Town with the real one Madarame, Kira, Ayasegawa and Hisagi, who were assigned to defend the pillars, each faced Fracciones sent by Barragan Yumichika faced off against Charlotte Chuhlhourne It became a fight over beauty between Chuhlhourne, who touted his own beauty, and Yumichika, who denied it A princess always gets her way If I say its over, its over W-What is this Rosa Blanka, the Sentence of the White Rose Enveloped in this briar covered with black, you will die, unseen by anyone, smothered in white petals Unseen…by anyone Thats right In anyones eyes… I see Thank you Tear in frenzy, Ruriirokujaku What is this This thing! Its futile Those flowers are growing by stealing your Spiritual Pressure From here on, all the Spiritual Pressure you radiate will become that of the flowers Do you understand The moment those flowers bloom, will be your end, Charlotte Chuhlhourne! D-Damn it! Ill help myself to some of your Spirit Energy Thank you for the treat Y-You Youre sneaky… keeping such an awesome technique hidden like that The second level of Zanpakuto transfiguration… This was Bankai, wasnt it Wrong It wasnt Bankai Ruriirokujaku is the actual name of my Zanpakuto This is an odd sword, you see Its picky about colors Ruri is its favorite color And it dislikes the color Fuji Fujikujaku is a nickname I arbitrarily gave it This sword despises that name When I call it that, it sulks and only goes into partial release state Why do such a thing Squad 11, where I am, is the strongest fighting squad among the Thirteen Court Guard Squads Were made up entirely of a group of fools, who gathered out of respect for Captain Zaraki, and who live to fight We all feel that if were going to die, well go out with a good fight Because of that belief, we all made an unspoken agreement from way back that our Zanpakuto would only make direct attacks Kido-type Zanpakuto look bad and are an embarrassment, so just having one gets you treated like a coward I dont want to show this swords power to anyone in Squad 11 Particularly not to Ikkaku and Captain Thats why when you covered me with the briar, I thanked you If you hadnt used that technique, I could not have released this sword in our battle Even if it meant losing to me because of that Even if it meant losing to you and dying You really are a piece of work Hey… Arent you going to draw your sword This is my weapon Im well aware of the toughness of your Hierro! Oh So youve fought an Arrancar before Yeah Hey, big guy! Whats your name Why do you ask such a thing I have no intention of telling my name to an opponent who is no match for me Okay then, dont tell me your name! Im third seat of the Zaraki Squad, Ikkaku Madarame! I let my opponent know the name of the man whos going to kill him Thats my style! I dont get it Dont get what A while ago, you said youd fight with strength equal to a lieutenant Even giving you the benefit of the doubt, your strength right now was about fifth seat Whats up with that Exacta That is correct Correct, you say My strength right now is indeed at the level of a fifth seat in the Thirteen Court Guard Squads It pleases me that you made the correct assumption Just what I would expect of a lieutenant You pass What This is a test A test to check to see if you could accurately measure my strength Unless I did that, you wouldnt realize it even if I fought at lieutenant-level strength, right The way you talk bothers me The way you put it, it sounds as if youre saying you have a way of accurately fighting at the strength of a lieutenant Exacta My current strength is that of a fifth seat And… The impact of his sword is greater! This is fourth seat! Third seat! Quit fooling around! Am I getting closer And… This is lieutenant level! Bakudo 39: Enkosen! Are you done already That was pathetic, Izuru Kira! Ah well, but thats to be expected when youre facing Aguila Dont think theyre just wings These are wings of steel, heavier than boulders, that smash everything they come in contact with! Wings of steel, eh Thats a good name It sounds strong However, it doesnt change the fact that they are still wings Oh Another technique Hado 58… Tenran! So you thought a tornado would work if these were still wings Well, it wont! His power and speed are to be reckoned with But if I can lure him into a cramped room… Hado 31… Shakkaho! He went through the trouble to invite me to his position How would you respond to that Quit scurrying about, you rat! Devorar Pluma! Its able to pierce through the building! There you are! Damn it! Hes hiding behind all sorts of things! Theres no sign that the number of wings is decreasing Must be his instant regeneration ability They probably regrow from the tip where they break off If thats the case… As hes running away all over the place, he might be thinking up some kind of plan But I wont let him! What What is he doing! Where did you go this time! What! Were your legs crushed because you couldnt get away in time I didnt think I used that great a speed, though! You saved me the trouble For what Your long-distance attacks were tough to deal with All this time, I was thinking of a way to make you attack me directly You see, theres no point in cutting objects separated from its target with my sword I dont understand what you mean What in the world are you going to cut with that oddly shaped sword! What the hell is this! Damn it! Whats happening! My wings are suddenly… It makes what it cuts weigh double If I cut twice, it will weigh double again Cut a third time, and it will weigh double again That is the power of my Zanpakuto, Wabisuke Raise your head! Wabisuke! In that instant where you attacked me, I delivered four strikes across your entire wings If your wings are truly heavier than boulders, they became much too heavy to fly a long time ago You dirty bastard, using a cheap trick like that Is that how a warrior fights! Dirty Oh, thats right Before we began fighting, you were shouting out to get us both fired up If thats how a warrior acts, the idea is completely outside my understanding Squad 3s squad flower is the marigold The flower holds the meaning, despair In other words, it is the pride upheld by Squad 3 A battle must not be heroic A battle must not be exhilarating A battle must be gloomy, filled with despair, frightening and grisly That is what makes people fear battle and choose the path that avoids battle I believe that my Zanpakuto, Wabisuke, among all Zanpakuto, best coincides with Squad 3s philosophy It continuously increases the weight of what it strikes until the adversary ends up crawling on the ground, unable to bear the weight Then, without fail, as though to apologize, the adversary extends his head That is why it is called Wabisuke Whats so funny What do you mean, despair Fear battle Avoid battle! Let me throw your exact words back at you The idea is completely outside my understanding! Battle is about… firing up oneself to crush your adversary Its exhilarating! You cant defeat me with that! It wont be me wholl extend his head in apology! Itll be you! Devorar Pluma! How Your defeat was already decided the minute one wing was rendered useless No matter how hard a bird tries to stand up and fight, a bird crawling on the ground is mere prey Earlier, you asked, What in the world was I going to cut with that oddly shaped sword, didnt you Wait… Please wait a minute! A warrior shouldnt beg for his life Farewell, sky warrior If possible, I hope you wont forgive me (Mirin=sweet rice wine) Lieutenant, say mirin ten times Mirin, mirin, mirin, mirin, mirin, mirin, mirin, mirin, mirin, mirin What animal has a long nose (Kirin=giraffe) Kirin Thats not right! The correct answer is elephant! Substitute Soul Reaper Work Journal! What the hell are you doing! Shut up! Keep still! How is it Delicious What is this Its a confection I made per the captains orders, but it just wont sell I wonder why Its this… Yeah, that wont sell Substitute Soul Reapers have a terrible sense of aesthetics No, I dont "
" In order to prevent Aizen from wiping out Karakura Town, an Enriched Spirit Zone, the Soul Reapers evacuated the people of Karakura Town by using four pillars to relocate the entire town to the Rukon district Ikkaku Madarame, Izuru Kira, Yumichika Ayasegawa and Shuhei Hisagi were assigned to defend the pillars The four faced the Fracciones sent by Barragan The battle between Charlotte Chuhlhourne and Yumichika escalated into a battle over beauty Yumichika struggled against Chuhlhournes Resurreccion, Reinas de Rosas, but emerged victorious by using Ruriirokujaku, his Zanpakutos genuine form At the same time, Kira faced off against Abirama Redder Against the Devorar Pluma attacks by Abiramas Resurreccion, Aguila, Kira was forced on the defensive However, Kira was waiting for his adversary to make a direct attack Then, by using the power of his Wabisuke to make Aguilas wings of steel heavier, he finally brought Abirama down to the ground What! Were your legs crushed because you couldnt get away in time I didnt think I used that great a speed, though! You saved me the trouble For what Your long-distance attacks were tough to deal with All this time, I was thinking of a way to make you attack me directly You see, theres no point in cutting objects separated from its target with my sword What the hell is this! Damn it! Whats happening! My wings are suddenly… It makes what it cuts weigh double If I cut twice, it will weigh double again Cut a third time, and it will weigh double again That is the power of my Zanpakuto, Wabisuke Earlier, you asked, What in the world was I going to cut with that oddly shaped sword, didnt you Wait… Please wait a minute! A warrior shouldnt beg for his life I dont get it Dont get what A while ago, you said youd fight with strength equal to a Lieutenant Even giving you the benefit of the doubt, your strength right now was about fifth seat Whats up with that Exacta That is correct Correct, you say My strength right now is indeed at the level of a fifth seat in the Thirteen Court Guard Squads It pleases me that you made the correct assumption Just what I would expect of a Lieutenant You pass What This is a test A test to check to see if you could accurately measure my strength Unless I did that, you wouldnt realize it even if I fought at lieutenant-level strength, right My current strength is that of a fifth seat And… The impact of his sword is greater! This is fourth seat! Third seat! Quit fooling around! Am I getting closer And… This is lieutenant level! Can you feel it This is a lieutenants Spiritual Pressure, and this is a lieutenants power! And, this is a lieutenants… sword! Cmon, cmon, cmon! Cmon, cmon, cmon, cmon, cmon! Whats the matter Cmon! Cmon! Its useless! I wonder how long you can last How was that That was a lieutenant-level Spiritual Pressure, Cero and Bala! So then, Lieutenant… How do you feel You appear quite exhausted Dont you think its about time for you to get serious, Lieutenant! This is a lieutenant speed Whats the matter, Lieutenant! You seem quite worn-down In a battle between lieutenants, would only one side be worn-down like this! I wonder what this could mean Youre fighting me, who is at lieutenant-level ability, but youre the only one getting worn-down What do you think is happening Youre an annoying bastard Are you trying to tell me that I dont have the strength of a lieutenant Exacta! Just what I would expect of a lieutenant! If I havent misjudged the strength of you Court Guard Squads, then that is precisely what it means! Dont call me Lieutenant Its Shuhei Hisagi! I told you my name at the start, remember How rude of me It slipped my mind It was a breach of etiquette for me to allow only you to identify yourself Ill tell you my name I am Findorr Calius, a Fraccion of His Majesty Barragan Well then, now that Ive complied with your etiquette, its about time I put an end to the battle… in a manner that follows your methods In other words, this will end with me slashing you to death! Shuhei Hisagi! Carve upon the Water… Pinza Aguda! Is that what you call an Arrancars Resurreccion Exacta! That is correct Very good Youre badly mistaken if you think youre the only ones with information on your opponents No, I never thought that way Exacta! I give you credit for following the speed of my Sonido with your eyes! Correct this, correct that… Youre one annoying bastard! Seems you still have a lot of fight left To live is to face one difficult problem after another The ones who survive are the ones who choose the correct answer just a few more times! Therefore, anyone would want to possess even a few more correct answers! Am I wrong! Is that why youre giving me the correct answers Such grand talk Bakudo 62: Hyapporankan! Youre finished! Motormouth! Dont underestimate me! Soul Reaper! A high-pressure water stream! Exacta! Its not a good idea to turn your eyes away from your enemy No es exacto! Wrong answer! Too bad, Soul Reaper! You think youve escaped me! Its over! Reap Kazeshini! Hisagi… Finally I see So thats your Zanpakuto, Shuhei Hisagi Yeah… This is my Zanpakuto, Kazeshini Im not very fond of it, though What do you mean Just that… I dont like the shape of this thing Look at its shape See how it takes the form of something that reaps lives Damn it! Youre not getting away! Hard to predict the trajectory of this thing, isnt it Afraid Whos afraid! I see Im afraid Afraid Afraid that your own power is too huge! What cheap narcissism! Keep dreaming, Soul Reaper! In fact, allow me to wake you up! Right now! Its over! When I strip off 90 percent of my mask, my strength becomes equal to that of a captain! You, a lieutenant, have no chance of winning! Youre not afraid of your own strength… or the enemys Youre not much A person who isnt afraid… A person who isnt afraid of the sword he holds… is not qualified to hold a sword That is what I was taught Are you feeling afraid now Youre equal with me at last Damn you! Take this! Equal to a captain, you say You are so far off The pillar is… destroyed! Destroyed! By whom! Ik… Ikkaku! Madarame was… defeated! Madarame was defeated We have to hurry and help him! Leave that to me! After all, this arc is about helping us, the unfortunate lieutenants who dont get enough screen time I see! Iba, dont say unfortunate and things like that And Hisagi, dont sympathize with him Substitute Soul Reaper Work Journal! SUBSTITUTE SOUL REAPER WORK JOURNAL Please have a look I see… Well done, Kuchiki Nice work Yes, sir Are you serious Also, about the illustration… Yes, I have it right here What!

" Other than being able to see Spirits, I, Ichigo Kurosaki, was a very ordinary high school student When I met Soul Reaper Rukia Kuchiki, I obtained Soul Reaper powers that allowed me to protect people As I began my work as a Substitute Soul Reaper, I was sucked into a maelstrom of battle Orihime Inoue was taken away by the treacherous Soul Reaper, Aizen Together with Chad and Ishida, I headed into Hueco Mundo to rescue Inoue and began my battles against the enemy, the powerful Arrancar In order to stop Aizen, who invaded the World of the Living, the Thirteen Court Guard Squads moved into action An all-out war was about to begin In order to prevent Aizen from wiping out Karakura Town, the Soul Reapers evacuated the people of Karakura Town using Tenkaiketchu, relocating the entire town to the Rukon district Madarame, Kira, Ayasegawa and Hisagi were assigned to defend the pillars The four faced the Fracciones sent by Barragan The battle between Charlotte Chuhlhourne and Yumichika escalated into a battle over beauty Yumichika won by unveiling Ruriirokujaku, his Zanpakutos genuine form Kira also emerged victorious by entrusting his Zanpukuto, Wabisuke, with his squads philosophy of despair Shuhei Hisagi went against Findorr Calius, who boasted that he could control his strength Hisagi proved to Findorr that a man who did not fear his sword had no right to hold one by using his Zanpakuto, Kazeshini However… Madarame was… defeated! Thats one pillar down That… cant be Ikkaku! Dont do it! Can you do anything against an opponent that defeated Madarame! I dont care! Let me go! If you insist on getting in my way, then Ill just have to clear the way! Dont be stupid! Cool your head! Shut up! Out of my way! H-Hey! That was very disrespectful language for a fifth seat I know youre distraught, but mind yourselves Kira… I used Gaten Hell be fine More importantly, if one pillar was destroyed, what does that mean Its a Tensokaiki! With the pillar destroyed, the real Karakura Town is starting to return! This is bad We have to stop the reversion somehow This bald guy seemed like he was still concealing some sort of strength, but… If hes dead, oh well Not so fast Whore you calling dead Dont go deciding that for yourself Itll take more than that to kill me! Youre wasting your time! If youre alive, show that strength youre hiding! Show it Say I understand Youre going to die Say I understand I… under… Dont make me laugh Strength Im hiding, you say I have no such thing And even if I did, I dont have the time to use it on a small fry like you! Is that so Then die Captain Komamura! Tetsuzaemon! Right! We stopped the reversion These are for emergencies, but as long as you fight without breaking these, it should be okay Iba… Hes humongous! Bigger than Captain Komamura I felt that one quite a bit, Soul Reaper Or should I call you dog Anyway, that was a good punch But… It wasnt a real punch! Captain Komamura! That is what you call a real punch! And while Im at it, let me show you what a best punch is like Breathe, Calderon! What What the hell is that! – What! – What! What is that! Its too much trouble to smash you So youve shown your true form Interesting Ill… Hey, Iba! Where are you going! Shut up! Were no match for an adversary that sent the captain flying! Huh! Whats with that yellow-bellied reasoning! Never mind, were getting out of here! Heavy… Weary… But it cant be helped Its Lord Barragans orders! Damn… Damn monster If that hit us, itd have been the end of us! Quit dawdling! Lets go! No way! Im fighting! If you wanna run away, you can run away by yourself! You say youre going to fight, but howre you gonna fight a guy you were no match for earlier! Or what! Is it like that guy says Do you have some strength youve being hiding No, I dont have anything like that Then be a good boy and come with me! Hey! There they are, those pesky… His stride is huge! Hell catch up! Keep quiet! Let go of me, Iba! The two of us cant get away! I said shut up! Its over C-Captain! Dont back away, Tetsuzaemon! Ever! Stand behind me! Sir! That had no effect, maggot! But I was surprised I never imagined a maggot like you could throw me, a Fraccion of Lord Barragan Damn it Iba, we should help Keep still Iba… Watch closely, Ikkaku Thats what the captain of our Squad is all about You lowly maggots have the audacity to defy Lord Barragan Its so unbelievable It makes me yawn I see Ill stop that yawn for you Bankai! Kokujo Tengen Myo-oh! Why you! Too bad for you Ive become accustomed to your weight Damn it! This time, Ive got you! Oh no! He cant use his arms! If he gets hit with that at such a close range, hes in trouble! Captain! What is… this guy! What is this What is this What in the world are you! Oh yeah I havent identified myself yet I am Sajin Komamura, captain of Squad 7 Im ashamed to say, as you said, Im a maggot-like fellow No mercy… Thats a good thing Real or replica town, it doesnt matter Squad 7 could be in the red for this fiscal season Captain will pay out of his own pocket for damages done by the squad He wont let the squad shoulder the bill Thats the kind of man Komamura is Is that for real! All right! Then Im going to fight without worry Youre not included What you break will be deducted from your salary No arguments Captain, youre a tightwad! I have so many things I want to buy this month! Youre such a… Umm… I think its a good thing we didnt make it in time Yeah Amazing Damn right Your Bankai and his are still as far apart as heaven and earth, Ikkaku – Iba… – Didnt think we knew about it You idiot! Relax I wont tell your captain But give it some hard thought, Ikkaku Your job this time was to protect the pillar, but you allowed your pillar to be destroyed Do you know why that happened Because you kept your strength hidden Its your prerogative to die while keeping your strength hidden, but dont ignore your orders because of that! Dont hurt the squads fight because of your selfish pride As long as youre a part of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads, orders are an absolute! Even if it means squashing your pride or honor, that is the one thing you must see through! Iba… I understand that But… What do you understand, moron Youre acting like a spoiled kid You think that if you die, theres someone to take your place Somewhere inside of you, thats what youre thinking, so you can lose like it doesnt matter Now wait… Im not going to let you get away with saying that Who says I could lose like it doesnt matter Well, isnt that the case! Where am I wrong Damn you! You bastard! Why did you charge him head on with those injuries Even if you charge him head on, its meaningless if you get crushed Do whatever it takes to win, even if it means running away from, or outfoxing the enemy! I cant do that! I cant fight such a cowardly fight! Then put on strength, damn it! If you insist on having things your own way, then make yourself stronger When you fight an enemy, win even if it means you die doing it Thats what it means to do the right thing C-Captain! Relax Unfortunately, Im a little hard of hearing today Chuhlhourne, Abirama, Findorr, Poww… Useless idiots I tried pricking my ears up So how do I look, Tetsuzaemon It was perfect! We received gifts from fans all over the country, but most of gifts were dog accessories and dog food Thats fine! Captain! Arrancar Encyclopedia! ARRANCAR ENCYCLOPEDIA Today, were discussing Barragans Fracciones Chuhlhournes sword release is Reinas de Rosas Abiramas is Aguila Findorrs is Pinza Aguda Powws is Calderon Written as you just saw… Except theyre all dead now Were still left Were next!

Such flagrant indiscretion, I must say What! Apache!

Be careful Itll chop you from the first one who touches that cyclone of ash – Soft – Soft Arent you being a bit soft You actually thought you could beat us with that! Haineko! Damn you… Im not going to lose! This is a joke! Huh!

Beginning with this segment, we will be introducing the Zanpakuto of the Soul Reapers Our first introduction will be on Byakuyas Senbonzakura Scatter, Senbonzakura When released, Senbonzakuras blade becomes a thousand blades resembling cherry blossom petals that slash apart the enemy Its Bankai form is Senbonzakura Kageyoshi It is impossible to escape from its all-direction attack Come to think of it, during Shikai, youre still holding the handle, right What about it Doesnt that make you look lame "

Youre awfully soft! If that is truly a weapon that kills an enemy in two strikes, if you had used Flash Step to approach me at the moment you stopped me, the contest would have been over Thats what I would have done Hes fast! One more! Youre completely on the defensive now! Whats the matter No way to attack You sure talk a lot… What, are you tired Huh Itll only take me one strike to finish you off I recommend you hurry up and use your killer or best move before that What! What the hell are you talking about! Let me tell you! Ill settle this contest without even using Shikai or my killer move! Im getting tired of this Youre still alive Oh…boy…… You know… Truth is, I wanted to fight that blonde chick… I have absolutely no interest in a lumbering fatso like you Fatso! Whatre you talking about Is something wrong with your eyes Or is it… I know Its jealousy, isnt it! Certainly, you are fat, and you look bad! And theres no denying you look shabby But thats not my fault! Dont take it out on me! What Look, you! No matter what someone who looks bad says to someone who looks good, no matter how much someone with no money complains to someone who does, it just sounds like an inferiority complex Hey Who is this guy who looks good and has money Are you an idiot on top of being ugly and fat An idiot Who are you speaking with right now Theres nobody else here besides you and me In other words… its me, of course! My looks leave nothing to be desired! And whats more, I am a man of enviable wealth! And look at this sense of style! I talk a lot Yeah Do all Arrancar talk that much during a fight I have a tendency to become talkative when the battle looks so easy I see Then to make you talk less, I just have to make it difficult for you Unfortunately, my second in command is quite annoying Im afraid I have all the talk I need What! All Im saying is to be quiet for a while Ill fix that wise-ass mouth of yours so you cant talk! I dont think so I have him! You think I cant keep up with that level of speed! Sorry, but Im still talking! Looking at your uniform, youre the captain of Squad 2, arent you What they call the Stealth Force I heard the Stealth Force was comprised of assassins, but your way of fighting is awfully soft Or is this level of fighting what the Soul Society considers an assassination Which reminds me, earlier you said you didnt have time to ask my name Lucky you Now you have time to hear it I am His Majesty Barragans Fracciones, Ggio Vega And while Im at it, Ill tell you the other name, as well Bite Off, Tigre Estoque! A good-looking man is bred from good lineage and a good environment It polishes the senses Oh, a pauper wouldnt understand the sense of a hot man like me! I got it, I got it Shut up already, fatso I dont want to be called fatso by a fatso! And besides, Im not fat! Im full-bodied! A symbol of abundance! Its different from how a pauper like you bloats up for no reason! So there! Man, you are such a pain A real pain in the ass Moron! I think youre a real pain too, you know! Ive made up my mind Im going to put an end to this right now What is that now In the first place, those clothes youre wearing arent cool! Huh Stomp Down… Mamut! Mamut! Damn it! These guys use sneaky transformations! Becoming huge like that! Im only fighting with my sword! Huh In my Resurreccion, my movements become slower the bigger I get, but for a fatso like you, its just right, isnt it Hows that! Once more! Hey, fatso! If you cant keep up with this movement, you really are a slowpoke! Im not fat! Im full-bodied, I said, youre the real fatso, you! Youre not exactly fleet of foot either! This coming from a guy whos running away! Even being rich doesnt make you a fast guy Right! Like hell Im going to fight you head on! What! Moron! In a street battle, legs arent important, savvy is! With that body, going down is easy, but climbing is tough! If you can follow me to this height… Sorry to keep you waiting! Okay…here I come! His attacks are sharper! Hey, how long do you plan on analyzing my moves like that The same could be said for you No doubt But dont think youll have that sort of leeway forever! Hes increased his destructive power, as well! Theres no time to rest! Oh…not bad! Then, how about this! I see… Resurreccionn increased his attacking power by several levels! Take this! And his speed has increased! However… Thats not enough to kill me! Now thats more like it… N-N-No fair, you! You cant have awesome jumping ability with that size of yours! How strong are your legs, anyway! Dont you know Its not good to judge a person by appearances Take this! Running away isnt getting us anywhere! You cant keep running with that huge body If you had the choice, maybe you shouldve spent your money on becoming more agile Youre mine! Im not just running away, am I How did you! Who do you think I am What I am lieutenant of Squad 2, and concurrently leader of the Stealth Force Second Unit, Patrol Troops, Marechiyo Omaeda! Thats the Stealth Force Theres no way Id be slow You were putting on an act You mocked me! Smash em, Gegetsuburi! Let this be a lesson Its wrong to judge others by appearances The same technique again… Well, it looks like the attacks are starting to have an effect I fully understood that you were not attacking me all that time, watching how I would make the first move I knew, too, that you were doing that because you felt inside that you still had the leeway to field my attacks But unfortunately, this is still not everything that I have I think its to your benefit to discard that sense of having leeway as soon as possible Interesting All right! You fool! I won! Serves you right! Talk smack to me, will you! Look at you now, pauper! Hopping like a bunny with that huge body of yours! Youve got no substance! Youve got a face like a vacuum cleaner, you bastard! Shall I tear off this funny nose of yours! Well! Oh I…uh… Sorry…I was so obsessed with this nose that I… Ive always admired a long, good-looking nose like this, you know… Is that so Then I will extend your nose, too Uh, no, Im sorry! I was just kidding! Just kidding! I said just kidding! Let go! Youre going to stretch it! Like this Uh…come on! Give me a break! Oh… Ow ow ow! My nose is still here, right What! What just happened! What the… C-Captain! An Arrancars Resurrecion form sure is difficult to pronounce – Tigr… – Thats Tigre Estoque! Written with the Chinese characters for tiger, fang, swift, wind and read Tigre Estoque! Save stuff like that for the Arrancar Encyclopedia Shut the hell up! The powers that be wont let me! Todays Zanpakuto is my younger sister, Rukia Kuchikis Sodenoshirayuki Dance, Sodenoshirayuki It is a snow and ice type Zanpakuto Sodenoshirayukis blade, guard and hilt are all pristine white It is said to be the most beautiful Zanpakuto in the Soul Society today DEEPLY TOUCHED My Zanpakuto, the most beautiful… 	I dont deserve such praise! Im just stating the facts "
" Other than being able to see Spirits, I, Ichigo Kurosaki, was a very ordinary high school student When I met Soul Reaper Rukia Kuchiki, I obtained Soul Reaper powers that allowed me to protect people As I began my work as a Substitute Soul Reaper, I was sucked into a maelstrom of battle Orihime Inoue was taken away by the treacherous Soul Reaper, Aizen Together with Chad and Ishida, I headed into Hueco Mundo to rescue Inoue and began my battles against the enemy, the powerful Arrancar In order to stop Aizen, who invaded the World of the Living, the Thirteen Court Guard Squads moved into action An all-out war was about to begin In order to prevent Aizen from wiping out Karakura Town, an Enriched Spirit Zone, the Soul Reapers moved Karakura Town to safety in the Rukon district and took up positions in a replica of Karakura Town that they had placed in the World of the Living Upon Genryusais order, each of the Soul Reapers faced off against the Espada and Flacciones Soi Fon, captain of Squad 2, faced off against Barragans Flaccion, Ggio Soi Fon engaged in a mid-air battle with Ggio in his released form, Tigre Estoque, but Ggios increased speed and strength of attack gradually began to run her down Meanwhile, Omaeda, who faced off against another of Barragans Flacciones Nirgge, also struggled against Nirgges released form, Mamut Omaeda could only run away from Nirgge, who swung his trunk and chased Omaeda with speed that did not match his body It appeared Nirgges attacks had finally caught up with Omaeda, but… How did you! Who do you think I am What I am lieutenant of Squad 2, and concurrently the leader of the Stealth Force Second Unit, Patrol Troops, Marechiyo Omaeda! Thats the Stealth Force Theres no way Id be slow Smash em, Gegetsuburi! All right! You fool! I won! Serves you right! Talk smack to me, will you! Look at you now, pauper! Hopping like a bunny with that huge body of yours! Youve got no substance! Youve got a face like a vacuum cleaner, you bastard! Shall I tear off this funny nose of yours! Oh I see So it was all an act, huh Uh, no, Im sorry! Cmon… I said wait Oh… Ow ow ow! My nose is still here, right What! What just happened! What the… C-Captain! C-C-C-C-C-Captain! Are you all right, Captain! I mean, whats gotten in to you, Captain! You look like youre in serious trouble, Captain! Shut up! Dont make a fuss over something so minor Youre stifling me But…Captain! Turning your back to an enemy during battle is inexcusable, even if your superior is down But what subordinate wouldnt rush to their fallen superiors side! Besides… That guy has overwhelming strength to be able to put this much pressure on Captain We have to fight him together, Captain! Is that compassion for your superior Or is it loyalty Thats not it at all! Its just that… Just what I dont ordinarily even feel like dealing with your arrogance, but dont forget that sometimes it leads to insulting me! Move Youre in my way! Have you completed your farewells with your second in command Why would I have to do that Because youre going to die Isnt it obvious Even if I should die, I have no need to tell him farewell Glad to hear that Whats the big idea of treating me like a nuisance when Im just concerned about her! No matter how you look at it, that was mean! She landed on her butt She hasnt got any leeway! Damn, she really pisses me off! That bastards impressive… Hes keeping up with Captains moves! In fact, hes evenly matched against the Captain! Wait… Can you really call that even! Isnt it nice that our weapons are similar! You can fight using familiar fighting techniques! You can make full use of all your strength! In other words… Even if you use all your strength, this is the best you can do! I knew it Captain is getting pushed back Is she putting on an act! No, even if she were putting on an act, that prideful captain who shoved away my offer to help would never pretend to be losing Should I go to assist, after all No, if she says something like she did the last time, even my natural reaction would be dont monkey with me! Thats right, see if I go to assist! I dont care what happens to her! Is that so Oh, damn right! Dont forget about me! Worried about your subordinate, after all If I have to worry about my subordinates each time, thered be no end I wonder But it looks like there wont be anything about your subordinate to worry about Why is that I doubt your second will be alive What do I care Its his fault for being weak He gets what he deserves You are quite a cold captain Maybe I overdid it I shouldve held back a bit That fatso was a real wise ass and annoying, but its not fun if it ends like this Well now, you have nothing more to worry about, right I think Ill settle this now Worry, you say Sorry, but I hold no such feelings toward my subordinates And besides… Oh that hurt Damn you! I wonder why it is I dont really know why myself, but my bodys been sturdy since the time I was a kid Maybe its because rich people are built differently than the average joe, after all Ill fix that wise-ass mouth of yours so itll never speak again! Im not falling for the same thing twice! Smash em, Gegetsuburi! Here goes! Cmon, cmon! What happened to the fight you had earlier Are you afraid of my strength! Im doing well! Did you see that, Captain! Whats she doing Shell get killed! Oh no! No fair, you bastard! One more time! Looks like our roles have switched, captain of Squad 2 It seems your second in commands battle will be settled soon Its about time we settle this side, as well Now you know Damn it! Its useless You cant run away anymore It looks like your bosss fight will end first, though Thats not my concern Shes in quite a peril over there… Do I go to help her… No…But… If I dont do something about this guy first, hell attack me from behind! I cant do anything unless I get this trunk off of me… A Cero Here I go! I wonder whatll happen if you get hit at pointblank range Come to think of it, I told you my name, but I didnt have the time to ask for yours Not that it really matters, though See you, captain of Squad 2 What is this Youre in the way Howd you appear all of a sudden Gotcha! Didnt Nirgge kill you Nirgge Oh, you mean that elephant bastard I can use this force against him… Idiot! I used the strength of your pull! Captain! Thats how it happened! Anyway, I did it, Captain! I got him! Now, Captain! This is your chance! Got me! Who are you saying that to Blow away Who told you to come and rescue me Didnt I tell you earlier Your arrogance can sometimes be an insult to me But… I wanted to observe the strength of an Arrancars Resurreccion In preparation for the next battle against the Espada Well, never mind Ive seen enough of his limits Y-You-You dont have to put it like that! I came to rescue you, Captain, because I thought you were going to be killed! But whats with that! Who told you to come and rescue me Thats so mean! You said it like I did something I shouldnt have! Miser! Ogre! Meany! Wicked! Lend me your ear, Omaeda What is it You moron My guess is that you were worried that if I was killed, you would be next, thats why you came to help Well Am I correct I…never… Besides, lets say I was killed Have I ever taught you to come to my rescue I thought I taught you, if a fellow squad member is killed, think of it as a good opportunity Dont get in-between Stab the opponent from the back If there is that big a difference in ability between you and the enemy that you cant even do that, then let your fellow squad member be killed Thats the way of the Stealth Force! See Your enemy is still alive and well Hurry and get going Thats harsh! You dont have to treat me like a nuisance! Never mind and go And… defeat him quickly Sorry to keep you waiting, Arrancar… Ill show you what you mocked as the best a Stealth Force fight could be A real assassination… What! That bastard! Hes seriously lost it I cant get close to him like this! Unforgivable! Im never going to forgive you! That was an anticlimactic ending! Youre mine now! Sorry Where are you! I learned something earlier I thought I taught you, if a fellow squad member is killed, think of it as a good opportunity Dont get in-between Stab the opponent from the back Its not only when a fellow squad member goes down Ones own crisis can be an opportunity, as well You bastard… You mean you went down on purpose Its over! Youre going to show me a real assassination, you say Amusing Wait I take back what I just said What Someone of your low level might not be able to see it Dont…Dont mock me! W-What was that Look you! Im going to show you what true strength is! Behold! This is Tigre Estoques actual battle form! Tigre Estoque Sable! Sorry I said my Suzumebachi kills in two stings, but you probably felt only one, didnt you Damn it All right! You did it! Way to go, Captain! But I dont get it So Suzumebachi is effective even if it doesnt sting twice in the same place It did Huh I gave him two strikes to the same location in his right lung, once from the chest, and once from the back I went for the organs instead of the wound from the very start Never mind that Dont talk too much, Omaeda A new opponent Dont give out anything that might put us in jeopardy Right And follow me so you dont get in the way Right! That Mamut whats-his-name wasnt much of an opponent Wrong! My name is Nirgge Parduoc Mamut, written giant elephant soldier, is my Resurreccion form! It doesnt matter Youre already dead Oh shut up! Todays Zanpakuto is Renji Abarais Zabimaru Roar, Zabimaru! When Zabimaru is released it can extend and retract via its segments, allowing it to destroy even enemies at a distance It is a frightening weapon When it takes form, it is a baboons body with a snake for a tail, each with its own personality Renji is fond of saying that the two often complain to him together Youll have some, wont you, Rukia Now I understand why you get a lot of complaints "

Look you! Im going to show you what true strength is! Behold! This is Tigre Estoques actual battle form! Tigre Estoque Sable! Sorry I said my Suzumebachi kills in two stings, but you probably felt only one, didnt you Damn…it Here I come again! Haineko! I told you, its no use! I can block an attack of this level with Haineko… Now how do I use it to attack Excuse me Youre wide open! Looks like Soi Fon and Omaeda took care of their opponents Matsumoto seems to also be struggling What are you thinking Nothing that concerns you Worried about your subordinate If youre going to fight me, concentrate If you dont… Youll die Dont underestimate me! Not bad So you do know how to use a sword If I have a choice, I wouldnt use it too much Oh there you go again Good grief Say, mind if I rest over there Huh What sort of nonsense is that Shes a total loser Three against one is no contest from the start I wont hold it against you, so why dont you call over that kid over there Three against two would make it more of a match, you know I just told you, its no contest! That wont work on me! Youre no competition even against just me! W-What! Y-Youre! Hinamori! Is something the matter, Captain Aizen No, its nothing Nothing worth mentioning Your Spiritual Pressure wavered for a moment just now Whatre you talking about Something happened I dont know what youre talking about Hinamori… Why did you come here Hinamori… Are you…okay now Yes Dont worry, Rangiku Its true Ive come here as the lieutenant of Squad 5 and wearing the insignia of lieutenant… But Ive come in the sense of being the one who looks after her squad members I did not come as Captain Aizens subordinate That man is now… the Soul Societys… enemy Yes, he is If you understand, thats fine Hinamori… Lets go! – You might not have realized it… – Right! But just now, you said Captain Aizen Be careful, Hinamori Are you done with your boring conversation Tobiume! I see So that explosion earlier was the power of her sword Thats quite good You appear to be a lieutenant, but… Two lieutenants arent much different than three against one Mila Rose! Sun-Sun! Lets finish this! Lets take care of this silly battle and get back to Master Halibel! Quit giving the orders, you fool Youre the one wasting the most time But… I agree with your opinion See you! Holstein! What…the hell is this! Didnt you wonder How I managed to make my Tobiume hone in on you the first time Youre all considerably stronger than I am In order to approach you without you noticing me to a distance where Tobiuume can strike you, I had to approach you by using Kido to conceal my physical presence and Spiritual Pressure Thats why I used the opportunity to set a Kido net around Rangiku while I made myself physically hidden I never imagined that all three of you would be ensnared by it, though Damn kid! Snap, Tobiume Oh Oh, wow! Theyre really going at it over there What do you say, Mr Espada Isnt it time we got rumbling, as well Dont want to Dont say you dont want to Wheres the love You say you want to rumble, but youre not fighting like you mean it, either You havent even drawn your second sword The short sword is used in places where its difficult to fight with the long sword Theyre not meant to be used together Oh really For someone who says that… youve been switching your sword from between hands as you fight And Im not sure if youre doing it subconsciously, but your spacing is a bit closer to the target when you swing with your left hand rather than your right You carry two swords, one long and one short Youre dual handed, with each side having a different spacing And yet you claim youre not a double sword user Is that even possible You got me I thought I had evened out the spacing between left and right You have sharp eyes How scary of you And you can dodge! Incredible! You instantaneously adjusted your spacing just now! I couldnt tell that time! Why thank you! Arent you going to fight with them Of course not Two against one would be unfair Is this the time to be saying such a thing Stark is strong, you know  That old man is going to die Hell be fine! Kyoraku is strong, too! Dont say I didnt warn you Hes really going to die Youll regret it Thank you Youre very kind Ill pray that that doesnt happen Is that so Then, shall we go at it, then That wont do! Huh! Youre still a child! Fact is, you being at this battleground is not a good thing Child! Me! Look, you! Age means nothing to an Arrancar I know But no means no! To me, you are a child, and a girl, at that I cannot fight you! If you still selfishly insist on fighting, Ill force you to go home if I have to! You should go home and play with a ball or something Fine I get it If youre going to mock me to that extent… Lets get it on! Oh boy Pretty good! Isnt it about time you got serious I told you, I didnt want to get serious Then I want to ask you, Mr Espada What is it If I draw both swords, will you get serious Give me a break Youre entirely strong enough as it is Drawing both would be a problem I see Then I have no choice but to draw both So thats how its going to be Are you all right, Hinamori Yes Im sorry It was the first time I used that combination of techniques, so… Its all right That was awesome That was Hado 12: Fushibi wasnt it Its the first time Ive seen one that was this wide and complex Yes I wove Shakkaho together with Fushibi, then covered it with Bakudo 26: Kyokko to make it invisible, before carefully stretching it and laying it out in a net pattern Incredible To be able to combine several of these Kido in her own way This child acquired such abilities It was difficult to concentrate under these conditions, but Im glad it went well Im glad Shes in better shape than I thought Thrust upwards, Cierva! Eat Apart, Leona! Strangle to Death, Anaconda That cant be… I didnt think we could defeat them with that, but… Theyre practically unscarred When they do Resurreccion, their injuries heal Thats how they are! Damn Get carried away, will you! Here it comes! Leave it to me! Its huge! Tobiume! Haineko! Im sorry, Rangiku Just as I feared, their strength has increased several levels more than before If were not careful, well take the full brunt of their attacks I understand I will take that into consideration and deal with them! Deal with us You brats really know how to get on my nerves Dont go saying things that sound so full of yourself! Hold it! What good is it going to do to get even more angry with them Shes right Arent you the one whos getting carried away saying things like that Shut up! Why do I have to get irritated by you guys as well! Stop making things more complicated, and just shut up, Sun-Sun This could get troublesome if it keeps going Then what do you suggest we do Well use that to take care of them in one swoop Guess we have no choice To think we have to take that out on the likes of them Quimera Parco W-What… What is that What is that! Rangiku, lets counter that monster! Did you come up with an idea Yes If we skillfully combine Kido, I think we can create a monster every bit as gross as that one! Absolutely not! In todays segment, well introduce you to Kazeshini Reap, Kazeshini Shuhei Hisagis Zanpakuto Kazeshini takes the form of two sickles connected with a chain when released Apparently, even Hisagi himself does not know how they will move when he swings them around and throws them to attack Hisagi dislikes the form of Kazeshini, saying it reaps lives Ive already proved that swinging it around indiscriminately results in injury Dont say that like youre boasting "

That wont work on me! Youre no competition even against just me! W-What! Y-Youre! Hinamori! You appear to be a lieutenant, but… Two lieutenants arent much different than three against one See you! Holstein! What…the hell is this! Snap, Tobiume Are you all right, Hinamori Yes Im sorry It was the first time I used that combination of techniques, so… Incredible To be able to combine several of these Kido in her own way Thrust upwards, Cierva! Eat Apart, Leona! Strangle to Death, Anaconda Take that, and that, and that, and that, and that, and that, and that, and that… Whats the matter That child…Lilinette, was it Are you okay with that And that, and that, and that, and that… Why dont you say something to make her stop She wouldnt listen, anyway Shouldnt you be worried about yourself instead of the others Man… You are so right Bakudo 8: Seki! No way In my time, Ive seen hundreds of Cero Thats why Im going to tell you… your Cero is immature Its not even at the level of Menos As you just saw, I can knock it down with my bare hands I wont hold it against you Go on home Its unbearable to fight you anymore! I didnt think we could defeat them with that, but… Theyre practically unscarred When they do Resurreccion, their injuries heal Thats how they are! Im sorry, Rangiku Mila Rose! Sun-Sun!

Quimera Parco Its our pet, created from the left arms of the three of us in our released form Its name is Ayon What What is this chill Its like Im peering into a deep pit whose bottom I cannot see Just what I would expect of Captain-class If you continue to act like you still have leeway, youll get hurt, you know! You wont get away next time! Haineko! Oh, I forgot to warn you Ayon is deadly, so be careful Rangiku! Matsumoto… Rangiku! Rangiku! Bakudo 37: Tsuriboshi! Hang on, Rangiku! Ill heal you right away! From below the ribs to her intestines She cant breathe with these injuries I have to hurry! All the bones in my entire body are broken Both Rangiku and myself, taken out by a single strike This is crazy Theres no way we can win against this thing Bakudo 37: Tsuriboshi! Kira… Hisagi… Good job on holding down the fort Rest a while, Hinamori Well take care of this thing Huh! Who are those guys! Their friends, probably I saw them coming from the direction of the pillars If you saw them coming, why didnt you stop them, you! Oh, werent you in a better position to see them coming Or are your eyes just useless peepholes What did you say! Stop it, you two! Were in the middle of a battle! Concentrate! Help is coming one after another These guys sure like butting into others battles Ayon! Dont give them time to butt in! Kill them quickly! Ayon! Hes ignoring us, damn it Stop it, stupid Theres no way Ayon can hear what we say Hes got to have eardrums on him somewhere Well! I wouldnt know Ive never seen him react to what we say But never mind that Would you mind not seeking my agreement Its annoying Ayon probably gets his unfriendly side from you, Ill bet! He gets his face from you Those ugly horns are exactly like yours! You! Ill start by killing you before the Soul Reapers! Cut it out! It doesnt matter who Ayon looks like! Thats cuz his ugly looks, that most resemble you, make you want to look away What! What the heck are those three over there doing Kira, dont pay them any mind Right Im going to kill you someday! Thats enough! I knew it was a bad idea to bring him out Hes a creepy one Kira, Ill handle this guy You take care of Hinamori and Rangiku You sure you want to handle that thing alone Who said Ill fight alone! After youve done emergency first-aid, hide them using Kido and then come back here to assist me! Rangiku, especially, needs help quickly or she might die Im counting on you, former Squad 4 member When are you referring to Lets go Yes, lets do it Hey! Whatre you standing around in a daze for, Ayon! They took that Holstein with them! Bakudo 73… Tozansho Hang on a bit longer, Hinamori! Ill heal you soon! No…Im all right Hurry and help Rangiku… Hinamori is in pretty bad shape herself Shes either got a rib stuck in her lungs, or heaven forbid, one of her lungs has collapsed But… This ones in even worse shape Please… I hope my skills havent dulled This thing is a complete unknown Ill keep my distance and watch what it does Hado 11… Tsuzuriraiden Did it have an effect! My, my, that was pretty good He seems stronger than that Holstein and the other one Theyre all the same Judging by that attack… It was effective! I can do this! So this things weakness is Kido! You see Damn monster! He broke free with ease Couldve done it anytime, is that what youre trying to tell me Oh no… Hisagi! Right now, treating Matsumoto is the priority Why you… What It hasnt reacted to me yet! Will I make it! Iba! Is it over now That was fast I thought theyd put up more of a fight than that How disappointing Ayon is too strong Serves those Soul Reapers right! Ayon! Get on with finishing off the rest! Its coming! Damn it Im so close to finishing Just a little more Hurry Just a little more Good grief Making the Head Captain come out to the front line… Such hopeless squad members Lets go! Our battle has just begun! Thats right, our battle has just begun! That phrase sounds almost as if were getting cancelled Focus! Our battle has just begun! Not you, too, Head Captain… In todays segment, we introduce you to Izuru Kiras Zanpakuto, Wabisuke Raise your head, Wabisuke! Wabisuke has the ability to double the weight of anything it slashes The enemy ultimately becomes unable to bear his own weight and ends up in a position like a criminal bowing down as he apologizes for his crimes You might say it makes Kira both judge and executioner I can really understand why youd turn to alcohol to drown your sorrows Im fine Im fine!

He doesnt do well in school, but hes a bright guy And hes likable and doesnt lie Hes a hundred times better than me Youre incredible Huh I mean…I think its pretty rare for someone who could say so many nice things about his friend, when asked Kojima, are you good at excuses Im so good its sick Okay Then think one up in five minutes A really good one that wont get us  suspended even if we rescue Asano! Who shall I tell of this joy They were different than what we imagined Hmm…yeah, maybe they were… How different were they Way different Sometimes I think… Were all connected to this world with countless cords And like the patient in intensive care, we desperately try to not cut even one But the truth is,  no matter how hard we try,  they break at the point theyre connected Arent you going to call Nanako today Its difficult to reattach the cord to its original location… I still cant do it No, I dont feel like it Im glad to hear that Hello, hello Calling the new world Im glad I met you Does it appear our cords will connect properly Is my world spinning properly System: all red Communications: Good Oh yes… I sense a powerful Spirit Energy… AND SO, THE BLADE IS SWUNG Abarai, I hear youre going to the beach I have work to do, so I cant go, but I want you to get some photos in my place for the Seireitei Bulletin Of Rangiku in a swimsuit, right I didnt say that… – You dont want them – Please get them You shouldve just said so at the start! In todays segment well cover Rangiku Matsumotos Haineko Growl, Haineko! Hainekos power lies in the way the sword turns into ashes, which then slice to pieces anything that they land on with a single swing of the hilt It is a powerful Zanpakuto, but as Matsumoto puts it, it is a very petulant, lazy and stupid sword that is difficult to handle It really has a mind of its own… Who could it have taken after Isnt it quite obvious "
" Which should I choose…Is this too loud But this is a rare chance to go the beach, so maybe I could take a small chance and… No…but its embarrassing to show my navel… Whats the problem You dont have anything up top to show anyway, so theyre all the same! Leave me alone! I think Ill go with this one  So, what are you going to buy Please,  just leave me alone! Oh, Lady Yoruichi, youre wonderful! Oh, come on! Let me help you out! Shes dashing, even when choosing swimwear! No, please stop! Dont be so shy! Oh, no, no! I have to find my own swimwear! Soi Fon! I picked out swimwear for you, too! Huh PINK LAMÉ This one! What…no way… thats lame…too childish… No, wait a minute!  Theres no way Lady Yoruichis choice would be wrong! But…but am I okay with that Even if she is Lady Yoruichi, there are times when I have to stand my ground! L-Lady Yoruichi! I think Ill go with this yellow one… Ill take this one Thank you very much Lady Yoruichi… I envy her… Captain Soi Fon is petite, so she has a variety of swimsuit styles to choose from… Theres nothing cute in a larger size… Sis! Huh I found the perfect swimsuit just for you! SEXY W-Wait a minute, Kiyone! No way! I cant wear that… Oh, I think its lovely SEXY Ive decided on this one, – What! – What! and its a good opportunity, so choose that one, Isane B-But, Captain… Choose that one, Isane Y-Yes, mam…forgive me… And thats how it is… The Womens Soul Reapers Association has come to the World of the Living for R&R!

Allow me to explain what happened The truth is, the pool that the Womens Soul Reapers Association had secretly been building in the Soul Society was destroyed… Scatter, Senbonzakura Oh damn, he found it… Stingy Byakky! We were discovered because you brazenly built it in the middle of the yard! Im sorry Next time, I will fully equip it with a device that will intercept Captain Kuchiki Thats not the issue! But…really, what are we going to do now Build it in a new location But where I understand the problem Captain! Call me Executive Director here Y-Yes, sir… Do you have a good idea Yes, I do This is a good opportunity for all of us to go for R&R at a beach in the World of the Living – What! – What! All right! The beach! Do you understand now What were you people thinking! Its all good, Ichigo Because of that, you got to come to the beach with all these bathing-suit beauties Be thankful! Ichigo, this is a good opportunity You should show your gratitude towards all the people whove helped you from day to day Isnt that right, Big Brother Whyre you here, Byakuya I came because they wanted to apologize for building a bathing place on my mansion grounds Big Brother, please enjoy the World of the Living beach at your leisure Does this constitute as an apology Come now, dont think too hard, Ichigo Lets all have a great time today! Ukitake, youre all here too I invited Captain Ukitake I thought itd be nice if he got some outside air once in a while Were here because Rangiku invited us saying she prefers it lively We had nothing to do, anyway And thats how it is Ive been feeling better lately, and this is a nice change of pace Soaking in the rays of the summer sun feels great… Ukitake! Captain! Forgive me… I suddenly felt dizzy… Maybe you shouldnt have come, after all We should cool him down with some ice, perhaps Thats an idea… Somebody, go to that seaside kiosk and bring back some ice All right Ill go Im coming with you Excuse me Could you spare us some ice Sure! Inoue! Hi there, Kurosaki! Whatre you doing here! Working part-time Youre making a racket, Kurosaki! Ishida! Sado is here, too Whyre you all… Didnt you hear Captain Unohana asked them to do this Soul Reapers are my enemy, but I cant say no to Unohanas request Thats how it is, Ichigo We rented out the entire beach today We cant spread our wings as wed like in the presence of people from the World of the Living You went though all that effort So Kurosaki, you were saying something about ice Oh, thats right! We need it to cool down Ukitake who collapsed from too much direct sunlight Oh dear! Ill get it right away Toshiro! Ice, please! Good grief… Thats why I warned him not to over do it… Toshiro! Youre here, too Why arent you with everyone else I cant stand the heat Were having Toshiro make the ice we use here at this seaside kiosk with Hyorinmaru What! Is it okay to use your Zanpakuto for something like that Shut up You dont want the ice Oh, sorry! Make us some Reign over the Frosted Heavens! Hyorinmaru! Take it with you Its too huge! Then Ill take half Im going to make a test batch of the curry mitsumame dasheen frappe I thought up earlier!

See No, dont force yourself… Okay Ukitake, why did you gather everyone here Oh, thats right! The Inaugural Beach Arts Competition Essentially, its a contest about building various objects with sand and choosing the best one I will be the judge Thats all there is Okay then, please break up into groups of two or three people and begin Were at the ocean, but were playing with sand Id rather break watermelons or have a test of courage The winner will receive a cash prize envelope from the Head Captain! – Were on our way! – Were on our way! Theyre so about the money! What should we do, Big Brother Im not interested in the prize money, but Im not averse to showing off our artistic sense Lets go, Rukia Yes, sir! Are you going to participate Im fine just watching Im not good at this sort of thing, either… Come to think of it, Shihoin and Soi Fon arent here either… They said they were going to catch fish and went diving in the morning They havent come back since Think theyre all right Those two wont have any problems Is there a bucket somewhere We have to wet the sand first… We dont need a bucket Huh Because you see… If we press our breasts together to create cleavage, we can put water there and carry it! I see! Okay, shall we give it a try Hold your breasts like this and… Whatre you doing in broad daylight! Breast buckets Disallowed! What Why Because its not educationally proper! Who cares about that… You cant do this, so youre jealous, arent you Leave me alone! Were your breasts that big Uh…welll… Wh-Whatre you doing! Whats the matter Nanao has pads in her top! You dont have to say it! Okay, does that look done to you Not yet! Next we need to see who opens the castle gates first Youre both on! No, forget it… Im not interested in such a childish contest… Huh! Is that supposed to be an excuse or something! Are you afraid of losing! Huh! Okay, youre on! Go for it! Im not going to lose! Thats what I was going to say! Whats wrong, Ikkaku Is Ikkaku-san buried alive! Lets dig him out, Renji! It worked great! They sure are a rowdy bunch Cant they work more quietly Rukia, do not be concerned with what goes on around you Focus on your own work Yes! Forgive me, Big Brother Okay Quite nicely done Should I make the arms a little bigger Big Brother is so talented! What a polished aesthetic sense… As I thought, I still cannot hold a candle to him… At the very least, I must try my very best not to hold him back… They may not be related, but theyre two peas in a pod Its hot… In this heat, Ill collapse again and cause everyone to worry… Forgive me, Sentaro… Im going to lie down a while Wake me when its time Yes, sir! I wish theyd put a flush toilet in the seaside kiosk Kiyone! Youre back already Hey! Whatre you doing, Kotsubaki Fool! Im building a wall of sand so the sea breeze doesnt strike the captain while hes sleeping! Stupid… Whatre you talking about! You have to block the suns rays before the sea breeze! Ill go pick some flowers! Well gently block the suns rays with flowers! What Then Ill light incense so the captain can sleep more comfortably! What do you suppose this is My, my, this is a wonderful creation that appeals to the heart I think this is a pretty bad joke… Everybody! Lunch service! Fried noodles and rice balls specially made by the seaside kiosk Eat with care We have drinks, as well Uh…If you put it there… It sort of looks like a funerary offering… My, my, when you add all this, Captain Ukitakes team would appear to be the winner What Was Captain Ukitake in the competition Oh Am I mistaken Beats me… Hey, Ikkaku! Are you all right Damn Crab… Ill bury you bastards… Its ruined! What was that! Lieutenant Kotetsu! Lieutenant Ise! Watch where youre touching! The vine is going inside my swimsuit! Oh my… Thats awesome! If I take a photo, I could probably sell it for a good price What an uncaring thing to say! So it appeared, after all… Unohana! What do you mean! Truth be told… It was once rumored that a peculiar Hollow with immense Spiritual Pressure appeared at this beach Once rumored Why did you choose a place like that for our R&R trip! Forget that Ichigo! Rescuing Lieutenants Ise and Kotetsu comes first! Youre right! Ishida! Chad! El Directo! What! Spiritual Pressure attacks are useless… What do you mean Those vines have the power to absorb radiated Spiritual Pressure We cant inflict damage by any means other than a direct attack You mean we have to slash it with a Zanpakuto Damn! I dont have my Substitute Soul Reaper Combat Pass or any Gikongan right now, so I cant become a Soul Reaper! Rangiku! Rukia! Were here on R&R We had no reason to bring our Zanpakuto Sorry, Ichigo I left Chappy at the seaside kiosk Renji! I figured something like this might happen, so I brought Zabimaru with me! Roar, Zabi…ma…ru! Renji! Ichigo, here it comes! Wheres Byakuya! I havent seen Big Brother for a while Where did he go at a time like this! What about Ukitake The captain is asleep We have to protect the captain at all cost! I know that! We have to do something with just us! Inoue! Kurosaki! Inoue! Kurosaki! Sado and I will take over here In the meantime, go and get your Substitute Soul Reaper Combat Pass! Gotcha Thanks! What the—! Damn! Kill all enemy with your venom, Suzumebachi Whatre you waiting for Youre being lax, Ichigo! Yoruichi! We were going after sharks in the ocean when Abarai dropped in from above, so we became worried and raced back here What in the world is going on What is this monster I slept well Captain! He didnt wake up even once despite all this commotion… Is that man all right Oh! You started the watermelon breaking already Watermelon breaking Hes right! It tastes like watermelon! You finally caught on Big Brother! Whats going on Let me be the one to explain This is a watermelon-breaking event planned by Captains Kuchiki and Ukitake and myself Exactly What! Then that story earlier It was a story I made up to warm up the place What This is a special watermelon developed by the Department of Research and Development for use against Hollows Did she just say an anti-Hollow watermelon What possible use could it have A day at the beach is synonymous with watermelon breaking, so I asked the acting assistant chairwoman and had them bring it here Is it to your satisfaction Perfect! So this is a little surprise from the captains Did you enjoy it, everyone How are we supposed to enjoy this Captain… Say, Icchi, lets eat some watermelon! You mean you can eat this Everyone, its not over yet Huh Weve prepared watermelon for everyone All right then, everyone, enjoy watermelon breaking to your hearts content W-Wait a minute! Let the watermelon breaking game begin! Cut it out! Ahh, Captain skipped out! Quiet I told you, I cant stand the heat With all you men here, you have no opinions about our swimsuits Isnt complimenting us the proper thing to do! Thats asking too much of them Are you implying youll say something if we take them off! Stop it! Let me go, Nanao! Okay, Ill take it off if thats what you want! – Youre drunk, arent you – Let go! Todays segment is about Toshiro Hitsugayas Hyorinmaru Reign over the Frosted Heaven! Hyorinmaru! Captain Hitsugayas Hyorimaru is the most powerful of the ice and snow Zanpakuto, and creates a giant dragon of water and ice Its Bankai form is Daiguren Hyorinmaru Its power is immense, but it is a sad Zanpakuto that ordinarily has no use other than to make ice Its not sad Youre the only one who thinks that!

Indeed… The Spiritual Pressure is definitely gone Whats the meaning of this Its simple You are no longer one with your Zanpakuto I freed them from the Soul Reapers Our Zanpakuto Is that even possible What! What did you do! It wasnt me Its your Zanpakuto who are doing the destruction Impossible! The Zanpakuto have been released from the Soul Reapers spell! What is it! Put out the fire! Quickly!

Brother… Just who are you My name is Muramasa Tonight marks the end of the Soul Reapers reign over the Zanpakuto From here on, the Zanpakuto will rule over the Soul Reapers What are you upset about, Ichigo I bet I dont get much screen time for this new story arc, am I right Isnt the next episode where you get to show off some action I doubt it… Pretty skeptical, arent you Youll end up losing more screen time with that sort of attitude Im very sorry I promise to do my best in the next episode! Todays segment is on Ichigo Kurosakis Zangetsu Zangetsu is a type of Zanpakuto that is always in released form Its Bankai is Tensa Zangetsu Getsugatensho unleashes a slashing attack using ultra-condensed Spiritual Pressure Its manifestation is a man attired in black from head to toe Thats todays lesson on Zanpakuto You will find it useful for this story arc Oh… So thats what this is for "

Rukia! Hang in there! Whats wrong! Youre injured That you, Ichigo… Dont worry How can I not worry! What happened! This Spiritual Pressure… Shes not a Hollow She doesnt have a mask or a hole Are you this towns Soul Reaper Who are you! Hand her over What I dont know who you are, but Im not giving you Rukia! I see… So you’re the Substitute Soul Reaper How do you know about me! Somenomai… Tsukishiro That was…! Tsuginomai… Hakuren Damn you… Getsugatensho! Who the hell are you Both Tsukishiro and Hakuren are Rukias techniques! Yes Thats why they are my techniques What! Wait! Damn it! Rukia! Hang in there! Who is she! Rukia! Shes…Sodenoshirayuki… My Zanpakuto… What! Rukia! Rukia! URAHARAS SHOP Here you go Down I go I hope Sister is okay Orihime is with her, so theres no need to worry No problem Continuing on… Kuchiki said that the woman was Sodenoshirayuki, right Yeah But I never imagined a Zanpakuto would take physical form and attack its owner For now… I’m having Yoruichi check out the Soul Society We should wait for Kuchiki to recover first Rukia regained consciousness! Sister! Dont worry, Kon Im all right But, but… Jeez… She said shes all right! Why dont you trust in Orihimes powers! So Kuchiki, what happened on the other side It was a nightmare… My name is Muramasa Tonight marks the end of the Soul Reapers reign over the Zanpakuto From here on, the Zanpakuto will rule over the Soul Reapers The Zanpakuto will rule the Soul Reapers What do you mean Its exactly what it sounds like I told you Your Zanpakuto have already been freed from your control Roar, Zabimaru! This stuff about Zanpakuto is important, but… Where is Old Man Yama I believe hes the one who called us here Could you tell us Genryusai Yamamoto has been sealed away His Zanpakuto, Ryujinjakka, refused to work with us Therefore, your Zanpakuto, Katenkyokotsu, Sogyonokotowari, and Minazuki, combined their Spiritual Pressures to seal his power away What! Captain… Ridiculous… Is it even possible to seal away the Head Captain This is truly interesting Do you think we believe that Whether you believe me or not, its the truth Ikkaku! Captain Kyoraku, Captain Ukitake! Its pointless talking to him any longer! Kyoraku! I guess I have no choice… Captain! Isane, get Lieutenant Sasakibe! Yes, maam! Captain! Ill help you out! Kyoraku! Lets retreat for now! That seems like a good idea Oh It looks like its going to spit poison Everyone, run! You cant escape Whats going on! Where did the captains run off to! I want to take them on! Theres nowhere to run, Soul Reapers Damn it! Theyre just doing whatever they want! Do you suppose everyone is all right Yeah! We shouldnt have to worry about the captains! Hows your Zanpakuto, Rukia Its no good I cant use my Shikai I see… Here they come! What! Rukia… Bakudo Number Sixty One… Rikujokoro Brother! Rukia! Are you all right Captain! Dont let your guard down I see… The captains are truly impressive They certainly have the strength to control powerful Zanpakuto Brother! My name is Senbonzakura Go But… I will not repeat myself You should know better than anyone about how hopeless it is to challenge my thousand blades with a single sword Not good enough Its useless! Brother! Brother! Wait, Rukia! Let go of me, Renji! Captain Kuchiki is all right Anyway, look around you! Could that be… Tsuginomai, Hakuren I got separated from Renji I managed to get to the World of the Living through a Senkaimon while fighting Sodenoshirayuki Zanpakuto resisting the will of their Soul Reapers and attacking them… Ive never heard of such a thing Anyway, a Zanpakutos true body exists within their Soul Reapers inner world What is a Zanpakutos true body A Zanpakuto has a consciousness that controls its power— its true body A Soul Reaper can draw power from a Zanpakuto by conversing with its true body Does Zangetsu have a true body Yeah Naturally, my Benihime has one too The Seireitei… Is everyone all right Theyre all right The Thirteen Court Guard Squads still havent been destroyed Yoruichi! Back already Lady Yoruichi, how is the Soul Society! My brother… What about my brother! Dont panic Im going to tell you The Seireitei was in a terrible state The battle appeared to have ended, but buildings were in ruin and many were injured I looked for someone who could talk to me I ended up going to Squad Fours relief center I met Captain Unohana there, as well as Captain Ukitake and other members who had been staying in Squad Fours barracks So those bandits wreaked havoc and then suddenly disappeared Thats right There are many injured in Seireitei Several buildings burned to the ground, starting with Squad Ones barracks The damage is extensive Luckily, the relief center was all right Squad Two and Twelves buildings were also intact Captain Soi Fon and the rest of the Stealth Force are already going after the Zanpakuto And I hear Captain Kurotsuchi has begun to look into this phenomenon as well For now, lets use Squad Fours barracks as an information center We need to find skilled Soul Reapers among the uninjured and use them to boost our security Please take care of it With the Head Captain missing, we need to pull together Yes I guess I have no choice Im going to go back to the World of the Living I have to ask Kisukes opinion about this phenomenon of Zanpakuto rebelling against its owner You mean, you’re going to have him look into it as well, correct That sounds about right Well, thats great news The captains are all right But that doesnt change the fact that the Thirteen Court Guard Squads are in terrible shape Depressing… Lots of problems Even more depressing… Kurosaki, has anything changed with your Zanpakuto Not really I see To tell you the truth, there had been reports recently in the Soul Society of Soul Reapers having trouble with their Zanpakuto For the record, I had no problems with my Benihime In other words, the enemys control over Zanpakuto only stretches as far as the Soul Society and has no effect on Zanpakuto in the World of the Living Is the enemys power unable to reach the World of the Living or is there some other reason for this I guess we wont find out until we look into this When dawn breaks, Ill return to the Soul Society once more Please do Yoruichi… What about my brother I’m told they have confirmed the whereabouts of the other captains, lieutenants, and high-ranking officers But Byakuya is the only one still missing Brother… Its all right Byakuya would never die You know, better than anyone, how strong he is Yes Good evening! Bad news, Ichigo! What do you want at this hour! Weve got an emergency! Big problem Rukia disappeared! What! Sister! Sister! There is evidence that a Senkaimon has been opened It seems she went back to the Soul Society What is Rukia doing! Her wounds havent even healed yet She must have been quite worried about Byakuya I understand Urahara, open up a Senkaimon Im going after Rukia Wait a second, Kurosaki! Its dangerous to go to the other side in our current situation We need to gather more information first But we cant ignore Rukia! Still… Let him go, Kisuke I was planning to go in the morning anyway I might be able to work faster if someone comes with me Yoruichi… Please, Urahara! Good grief… It looks like I cant stop you I have no choice I will make preparations to assist you Try not to rush into things Okay Lets go, Ichigo Wait up, Rukia Dont do anything rash Sister! Im coming right away! I see youre ready to go Yeah! Youre going to have to fight lots of Zanpakuto in that form Yeah… Youre going to have to fight swords with your bare hands Sister, forgive my cowardice THE ARRANCAR ENCYCLOPEDIA The Arrancar Encyclopedia Today, Im going to be showing all of the names of the Resurrección that I havent featured Mamut, Tigre Estoque, Cierva, Leona, Anaconda… This is how theyre written Why are you showing them at this point I thought we still had time to introduce them But then this all happened If we dont do this now, they wont be able to rest in peace This segment is pretty difficult to host, you know Hows it difficult Why dont you give it a try then Huh "

G-Got it… But Im so glad that youre okay What about my brother… I mean, Captain Kuchiki Right, theres a search party out, but… No word yet… Hey, dont worry Theres no way the captain would get killed by something this petty Youre right Tonight marks the end of the Soul Reapers reign over the Zanpakuto From here on, the Zanpakuto will rule over the Soul Reapers Brother! Go I will not repeat myself Brother! Brother! Brother… Everyone… Stop it! Stop this, Sodenoshirayuki! Rukia Kuchiki… I will not tolerate your ordering me around What Dont forget Kisuke said so too, but recklessness is absolutely taboo Right… If you sense any change in Zangetsu, retreat immediately Zangetsu will be fine Its true that Zangetsu is special… To you… Yeah… But its the same for all of us We all think of our Zanpakuto as special I am going to check how the Stealth Force is faring Be careful I know Until later! I am no longer under your restraint I am free Whatever I do, you no longer have the right to stop me I see But why injure those who are innocent I just act as I see fit I will not spare anyone who gets in my way To be honest, I do not wish to fight you However… Dance, Sodenoshirayuki! So its true… I really cant use my Shikai Of course you cant I no longer exist in your sword Until now, you freely used my power as a Zanpakuto I allowed you to do so… Because us Zanpakuto had no other alternative No other alternative However, it will be different from now on I shall use my power for my sake, in any way I choose You always thought everything came from your own power But you are mistaken In actuality, you can do nothing I never thought that it was all my power… Somenomai, Tsukishiro! Impossible! Tsukishiros freezing range… Should only be within the realm, both earth and sky, of the circle drawn by its blade… Is that what you thought Wait, Sodenoshirayuki! Are you saying that… without you, I can do nothing! All creation, flap of wings The one who carries the title of human! In the name of truth and temperance, dig your claws into the wall of sinless dreams! Hado Number 33! Sokatsui! Impossible! Sodenoshirayuki… You extinguished Sokatsui! Are you shocked You certainly underrated me I see Let me clear up your misunderstanding My sword… So beautiful… Truly the finest beauty in all of the Soul Society… And yet, why Its as though you harbor a hatred towards me You are I And I am you Didnt we always exist together  Is what you said true Have I monopolized your power and made you suffer Did you know Whenever you reflect on the past, just as youre doing now, an opening is created in your Spiritual Pressure Tsuginomai… Hakuren! Tsuginomai… Hakuren! Ichigo Why have you come! Its dangerous for you to come here when we still havent uncovered why the Zanpakuto are rebelling against us! Shut up! How can I just sit back and watch Its okay If we dont know the reason, lets just find it Ichigo… Welcome, Substitute Soul Reaper What! Be careful Shes tough I know I mean, after all, she is your Zanpakuto! What are you waiting for I see… The thought that I am Rukia Kuchikis Zanpakuto makes you want to go easy on me Interesting You will soon regret it Somenomai, Tsukishiro What Get away from there…Ichigo! Damn it! Ichigo! Does it hurt Substitute Soul Reaper… You would come all the way to the Soul Society to protect Rukia Kuchiki So what if I did How foolish… Oh yeah What can you possibly do with that frozen arm when youre still hesitant to kill me Shut up! Then I shall teach you that such vacillation will only result in death Rukia! Hey! Rukia! Stay out of this! What is the meaning of this Sodenoshirayuki… If you feel hatred, direct it at me! You are right I do hate you That is why… In order to make you truly suffer… I shall take everything that is dear to you Your family and your friends, your pride as a Soul Reaper… All you have to do is watch I see… You truly are my Zanpakuto You know so well how to hurt me You are beautiful… I was so proud to have such a beautiful Zanpakuto like you for my sword I am not one of your belongings Youre right You are free Rukia I release you Huh So quell your anger I am grateful for the time we had together You will go on living without me Yes Even if I lose everything and end up crawling on the earth… Even if I must return to the Rukon District… Mask of the flesh and blood… Universal soar… – You seriously intend to destroy me – The one crowned with mans name… Carriage of Thunder… Gap of the spinning wheel… – Divide into six with light… – Dont you fear losing me!

Stop! Sodenoshirayuki… You will now be free Hado 73: Sorensokatsui! Rukia! How could you do this I never expected you would let go of me… A Soul Reaper cannot go into battle  fearing of what they could lose Even if that means losing ones Zanpakuto,  the life of a Soul Reaper Rukia Kuchiki… Farewell…my…self Rukia Kuchiki! Do you intend to die here like this Rukia! Are you okay! That was some show I didnt anticipate her going this far But this proved to be useful for future reference Who the hell are you! Muramasa Muramasa Who are you Ive never seen you around! Are you a Soul Reaper I am… a Zanpakuto I thought Zanpakuto manifest into the same appearance as their masters But Sodenoshirayuki is completely different How rude! What about yours Hes an old man The two of you got it easy Mine are a monkey and a snake! Im getting depressed just thinking about what appearance theyre going to take! – Oh… – Oh… The Arrancar Encyclopedia THE ARRANCAR ENCYCLOPEDIA T-Today, w-we have the Espadas as o-our guests Lets see… U-Um, about your numbers… Mr Stark, youre number one, Mr Barragan is two, and Miss Halibel is three, right Umm… See Didnt I tell you it would be difficult This is difficult on a whole different level!

" Zanpakuto… Their shape and abilities are based on their Soul Reapers soul Soul Reapers gain power by learning their names and synergizing with them They are born with Soul Reapers and die with Soul Reapers That is what Zanpakuto are A man named Muramasa causes all of the Zanpakuto to take physical form and attack Unable to use their Shikai, the Soul Reapers are overpowered The Zanpakuto deliver a serious blow to the Thirteen Court Guard Squads in a single night and leave The Seireitei is now in a confused, critical state Meanwhile, Rukia walks through the Seireitei alone in search of Byakuya, who has gone missing, when Sodenoshirayuki appears before her once again Sodenoshirayuki… You will now be free Rukia!

Thats really unpleasant Are you ignoring us Dont bother Theres no point in fighting Our enemies are over there But… They wont get away next time Im going to get back at that annoying bastard You’re right This time, I get to kill the guy who calls me by a weird name Yeah Lets teach them a lesson Youre a Zanpakuto! Thats right Sodenoshirayuki… leave this to me You retreat for now Thank you Wait! Where are you going, Ichigo Kurosaki How do you know my name That is not important What! What are you up to My goal is to release the Zanpakuto from the Soul Reapers Thats all I get it… Youre the one behind all this! In that case, tell me how Rukia can get her Zanpakuto back! Ichigo Kurosaki, what is a Zanpakuto What Zanpakuto are souls that are born within the hearts of Soul Reapers They share the same power as their Soul Reaper and exist alongside their Soul Reapers soul Soul Reapers find the power of the Zanpakuto hidden within their souls They converse with their Zanpakuto, come to an understanding and are able to draw from their power by learning their name A few chosen Soul Reapers can gain even more powerful Bankai, by manifesting an incarnation of their Zanpakuto and controlling it You and the captains have done this But living alongside Soul Reapers is not the only way for a Zanpakuto to live What do you mean I’m saying that a Zanpakuto has its own will A Zanpakuto’s will Yes Zanpakuto are not a part of a Soul Reaper We are separate souls Our existence is equal to that of Soul Reapers Do you find that unbelievable That is proof of how arrogant you Soul Reapers are Thats not true This is the reason why I exist I can understand the Zanpakuto’s will I can talk to their souls And I can give physical forms to those who share the same goals Impossible Zanpakuto who answer my call become separated from their Soul Reapers and appear in this world That is the power given to me Why would the Zanpakuto respond to you It is the will of Zanpakuto who have been oppressed I… I have never thought of Sodenoshirayuki as an inferior Rukia! That is just your own one-sided opinion As you can see, Sodenoshirayuki has responded to my call Stop pushing yourself Your have served your purpose What do you mean Do you really think that you were able to escape to the World of the Living on your own What I want to release all Zanpakuto from their Soul Reapers No exceptions In order to do that, I needed you, Ichigo Kurosaki, to come here You let Rukia go on purpose Welcome to my world Ichigo… Its all right You rest here I wont let you get away with this! Lets move away from here Do whatever you like Ichigo… Getsugatensho! Where is he! Put away your sword Damn it! Its useless What is this! Damn it! What the hell did you do! You bastard! Hear my voice Follow your instincts and release your soul Discard your fear Look ahead Go forth Dont stop If you turn back, youll grow old If youre hesitant, youll die Come Your name is…Zangetsu! What happened Ichigo… Zangetsu… Why are you here Old Man Zangetsu! Whats the meaning of this! Answer me! Werent we of one mind and body! Damn it! You can still move Its over now Old Man… Are you serious Damn it! Getsugatensho Captain Unohana! Whats wrong, Isane Maam! I have a report from Squad Twelve Zanpakuto have become separate entities Yes What does that mean This is the conclusion that Master Mayuri has come to after testing this phenomenon on his own body Could you give us the details Yes It seems the Zanpakutos soul really has left my body Interesting Truly interesting Master Mayuri, arent Zanpakuto and Soul Reapers different manifestations of the same soul Normally, that is the case But now they have become entirely separate entities Is such a thing possible Thats why this is interesting Youre so worthless Dont act as if you understand! But how was this made possible The situation is much worse than I had imagined Umm… May I ask a question Since theyre separate entities, whatll happen if we defeat one of the Zanpakuto manifestations in battle I dont know Would we lose our Zanpakuto forever It is possible But I cannot say for certain because we dont have enough data No… I understand Lets leave this to Captain Kurotsuchi Umm… One more thing Master Mayuri has a request for you, Captain Unohana What is it He wants you to provide him with data on the Soul Reapers who are receiving treatment from Squad Four so that he can analyze it Certainly I will have it all sent to you Also… He wants to gather data on you, as well Does he want Captain Unohana to go all the way to the Department of Research and Development Yes He said he needed data on captains Very well Captain! Its all right, Isane But… Umm… But for Captain Kurotsuchi to be personally inspecting your body is so invasive Were in a race against time, Isane Yes, maam In return, I want you to report to us any new findings Understood Yes, maam Reporting! Large-scale combat has been confirmed in the Seireitei! The Spiritual Pressures at the scene belong to Rukia Kuchiki of Squad Thirteen and Substitute Soul Reaper Ichigo Kurosaki! Whats this Who the hell are you Arent you Ichigo Kurosaki Thats the other soul that lives within him Other soul Getsuga… …tensho! Instant regeneration… This Spiritual Pressure… As I suspected Whats this I wont give it to you… I wont give it to you… Im not giving this body to you Dont do things without my permission! Zangetsu… Zan…ge… This man… Why, Old Man Zangetsu! Im bored with your internal world Its all buildings Theres no greenery I want to see forests I want to see the grandeur of nature Ill make a garden for you… Why How come the Women’s Soul Reaper Association gets to go to the beach! We should also take a vacation at the beach!! Were going to have a summer adventure! Thats right! Me too… Me too! It’s settled! Were going to the beach too! But the paperwork is tedious Ill do something about that! Lets do it, Chairman! – All right! 	– All right! THEIR HARD WORK PAID OFF NOW, OFF TO THE BEACH! What did we do to deserve this "
" Zanpakuto… Their shape and abilities are based on their Soul Reapers soul Soul Reapers gain power by learning their names and synergizing with them They are born with Soul Reapers and die with Soul Reapers That is what Zanpakuto are Is that so I understand Will you continue to investigate Yes sir! How was it, Kyoraku Did you learn anything No Old Man Yama is still missing What about on your side Were having a difficult time However, Captain Soi Fons Punishment Force is rushing to assess the situation, so were steadily learning the damage to each squad Furthermore, as each squad restores function, they are setting out to capture the Zanpakuto which have manifested themselves Cripes… Out to capture their own swords What a sorry state of affairs Also, about Byakuya who is missing… It seems he purposefully extinguished his Spiritual Pressure Thats strange Yes It seems the situation is not very promising Captain Unohana Youre here! Oh, I dont believe for a moment that you didnt sense my presence You frighten me And Kuchiki How is Kuchiki Well… Her life is out of danger But her wound is deep, and she remains unconscious I guess we should be grateful shes alive Im sorry we had to turn your barracks into a makeshift command center Thats perfectly all right At a time like this, we cannot scatter our military strength My Squad 4 will do everything we can But our top priority right now is to stop the Zanpakuto and their rampage About that… I had a request from Squad 12 for test subjects to analyze data I just came from seeing Captain Kurotsuchi You went, Captain What is it You personally went to see Captain Kurotsuchi This is not the time to wonder about such things According to Captain Kurotsuchi, currently, Zanpakuto have become completely independent from Soul Reapers Independent So if we err in the way we deal with them, its possible the Zanpakuto themselves will be destroyed North Block 12, nothing to report! We found nothing in South Block 75 either! Then where could they have gone To disappear like that without leaving a trace of Spiritual Pressure Theyre not mist or smoke They have to be somewhere No, maybe they did just disappear Huh! What do you mean They are originally Zanpakuto, after all They may not be in their manifested state anymore Lieutenant! Then how do we find them Dont sound hopeless! Listen, our very existence as Soul Reapers is on the line We must capture them at all cost! – Yes sir! – Yes sir!

Who is it! Here! Over here! Its useless for an idiot like you, no matter how hard you think! Youre awake Lieutenant…Kotetsu Your wound hasnt healed yet You need to rest a little more Where am I This is the Squad 4 barracks You were unconscious, but luckily, they were able to save you and bring you here I want to release all Zanpakuto from their Soul Reapers In order to do that, I needed you, Ichigo Kurosaki, to come here You let Rukia go on purpose Welcome to my world Ichigo! Where is Ichigo Kurosaki! There was no report from the one who brought you here Each squad is trying to assess the situation and take care of their wounded There arent enough hands to search for the missing Ichigo… Where is this Why Why am I here Old Man! Old Man Zangetsu! Arent you here Old Man! Is it true that he left my body Exactly! W-Why you… It seems you finally understand Im inside my mind! What are you doing here! Did you forget I am a Zanpakuto If I use its powers, entering the mind of a Soul Reaper is effortless What are you planning! What are you trying to do! What is your master thinking! Master I killed my master You killed…your master With my will, its easy And Ichigo Kurosaki… Ive taken an interest in you as a Soul Reaper What is that power of yours What is it that changes you in that manner Like Id explain to a jerk like you You just dont get it, do you Your power is nothing before my power Your defiance is useless Answer my questions And if I refuse How pitiful! Damn you! Just… Just who the hell… U-Umm… Who are you You really dont know Really… Youre so hopeless, Renji After all the years we spent together All the years Sorry, but I dont know any woman with a mane like yours Huh Well, Renji Are you still going to say you dont remember us N-No way… You two are the manifestations of my Zanpakuto Why that look of shock, Renji Y-You used to be a plain monkey and snake! Youre so stuck on petty details Its not petty! Theres a huge difference! Listen, Renji Do you realize how much you relied on us Relied on you! Yes Right, Snake What are you doing! Oww! A big one! Listen, you little brat! Whyd you hit me That hurt, you big-assed broad! Leave my hips out of this! And learn to carry your own weight! Oh shut up! You carry all your weight on your hips! Stop talking about that, you perverted brat! Whore you calling a perverted brat! Sorry, but if you dont have any business with me, can you come back later I really dont have time for this Huh What did you say Renji, you dont think… …were going to let you go What Renji, I think you have the wrong idea We came all the way here to get rid of you Wait! Why Why must we fight! We heard the voice Yes… A voice that stirred our instincts Instinct Yes I will fight Because that is my natural instinct! Awaken! Awaken your instinct! It lies in a deep, dark part of you Now…show it to me Old Man… Youre up, Ichigo Kurosaki Now, release it The instinct inside you I-I cant move my body Now manifest it! Show your inner self! Youve come Hey… Did you call for me Damn, what a fast sword! This is all it took to graze you Your strength isnt much without me, eh You really think so Isnt your strength my power Really I think that’s just what you tell yourself What You dont know what my true desire is What are you trying to say What is your purpose in separating from me I heard the voice… Telling me to listen to my instinct Instinct Yeah You dont understand me at all You don’t understand what my blade truly wants! What do you mean You dont like the shape of this blade, do you Well, look very carefully Doesnt it look like it could carve up a life Owwww! Quit playing around, Snake! Whatre you saying! You didnt even move, Monkey! Oh really Well now, Renji You seem to be taking us lightly Why dont you draw your sword Idiots! Like I could take you brats seriously! Besides, I have no reason to fight you Is that an excuse because you know you cant beat us What a hopeless man, Renji What! Id like to say theres no rush But we dont have time to play with a weakling like you! W-What! W-Whats going on What’s he doing here again Interesting… The inner world of a Soul Reaper And the other Ichigo Kurosaki who appeared from it The one who exudes the Spiritual Pressure of a Hollow Just what are you Me Im his real self You could call me his true instinct Instinct You are, you say The power Ichigo Kurosaki displayed when we fought… It was the same as a Hollows… I see… You are the source of that power I wonder… Now, its my turn to ask a question Just who the hell are you I am Zanpakuto Muramasa I free Zanpakuto Zanpakuto respond to my voice And my power awakens their true instincts So thats why even Old Man Zangetsu… And Rukias Sodenoshirayuki too… Fine If you possess the power of a Hollow and are Ichigo Kurosakis true instinct, then in turn, you can use my power to release the instinct that is inside of you Its over Why is the Zabimaru monkey female! Isnt that your secret desire, you pervert! Is that right Rukia, theres a reason for this! Ill never forget the night you made me submit to you! Youre awful Huh Orihime Inoue… ORIHIME INOUE AND RANGIKU MATSUMOTO 	PRESENT TODAYS CUISINE …and Rangiku Matsumoto… – …present todays cuisine! 	– …present todays cuisine! Kurosaki! Ishida!

" Zanpakuto… Their shape and abilities are based on their Soul Reapers soul Soul Reapers gain power by learning their names and synergizing with them They are born with Soul Reapers and die with Soul Reapers That is what Zanpakuto are This guy… Ordinary means wont work against him… Not bad Im not here to play with you If you have true power, hurry up and show it to me Sounds like fun… Damn… What the hell are they up to inside me Destruction of our Zanpakuto Yes, thats right Even if our Zanpakuto breaks, it returns to normal along with our recovery Now, however, our Zanpakuto have abandoned our bodies and operate as separate entities We may be jumping to conclusions if we believe that these Zanpakuto are no different from before So youre saying that our killing these Zanpakuto manifestations is the same as killing our Zanpakuto I suppose that is possible… but I think thats jumping to conclusions I agree However… If we must ultimately confront the Zanpakuto, can we fight rationally Too easy, Renji Man, I thought hed be much better than that, Monkey Do not belittle him We cant have him giving up so soon Look! Hes up! He stood up! Imbecile! Stop getting excited over something like that! Oww! You dont have to hit me, you big ass! Shut it! You perverted brat! Let go! Let go! Thats enough, you two! Dont quibble like that Wasnt I your opponent You dont understand anything, do you What Didnt I tell you We dont have time for weaklings like you Yup, you did! The big-assed broad said it! I said to stop it! You keep calling me names like weakling and whatever But what does that have to do with this A lot It is our true instinct And just what the hell is that We dont want to be weak We do not wish to be weak In other words, we want to be strong Were fed up with your weakness and wish to leave you That is all You sure put it bluntly! Roar! Zabimaru! How do you intend to fight Renji So running away is all thats left for you! Damn! He anticipates nearly every move I make Is it wise to rest leisurely in a spot like that! You disappear from my range of vision to attack with projectile weapons… Youre as rotten as you look! Rotten What of it Does it have anything to do with life and death Its not compatible with my way of fighting Like I care I am a Zanpakuto whose sole aim is to take lives I have no interest in how my master fights I always thought that the relationship between a Zanpakuto and a Soul Reaper was one of communication and synergy I dont know about other Zanpakuto! Im me I cut down lives! I thought that was our sole agreement between you and me I see Then its easy If you die and my Zanpakuto disappears, so be it I dont like you I just realized that Fine with me Because the feeling is mutual This speed… This power… This feels so good It feels as though its been a while since I unleashed my power without holding back And his raw nature… Hes…on the offensive Come on out, Zanpakuto! I know theres more to you Im surprised…that Im being pressured to this extent You must be a Hollow When Ichigo Kurosaki released himself from Zangetsu, you could run free inside him Isnt that the reason for Ichigo Kurosakis strange transformation at that time Am I wrong And if I say youre right I have nothing to say Just that if that was the trick, it wasnt worth my effort The relationship between a Zanpakuto and a Soul Reaper is communication and synergy However, I know now that there are exceptions like you who are kept reined in Its very interesting Hey, I let you talk and you put me down like that Hes been keeping me reined in Am I wrong Dead wrong! Then what Its none of your business! Besides, why are you so interested in Ichigo…in us Whats your aim You will know in time Yeah I dont know what youre up to,  but I wont let you have your way! Ill devour Ichigo and then take control of this body! Thats my true instinct! I see So you intend to stand in my way Then I have no choice I will extinguish you Nice try! Roar! Roar! Hey coward Weakling, coward… You sure like to call people names! Because you are a coward Theres no other description for you Sheesh… I quit Hey! Get more serious! But! Even after all weve done to him, he wont get serious! Its not fun at all! We know everything about you Like the time you gave up something very dear to you And that you tried desperately to get it back And…that still, you dont have confidence in yourself If we beat that precious girl to a bloody pulp and hold up her head, will you get serious Why you! We know The reason why you cannot kill us Its called weakness I think you went and did it It doesnt matter He wasnt the man we were seeking Thats all Hold it Where do you think youre going You intend to continue If youre leaving, do so after you beat me Forget it You have no will to fight Or did you think we didnt know You fight us You defeat us That means…you would be destroying your own power, right You cannot attack us because you fear that Unfortunately, I dont know either We have left our master already It would not be strange if, like Soul Reapers, death awaits us too Renji… You cannot destroy your Zanpakuto with your own hands In other words, you cannot come to terms with erasing us Am I right So how can you reproach me for calling you weak! The ability to fight is not the only criteria for strength! Whats the matter Is that all you have Dont think you can get me with your low level of speed Rest assured I dont I dont know what you have up your sleeve, but… What is this! M-My body… Whats the matter Is that all you have Damn it! Shut up… Its just like what happened to me… What is that Is that his You are just a Hollow Not a power that I seek So you can disappear The pain… What am I gonna do Am I weak Am I hopeless, after all – Just what have I been doing – Say something! Ive been forsaken by my own Zanpakuto… What have I been doing all this time It hurts… This pain… It hurts But its not my body thats being hit that hurts… Its my life force Monkey… What should we do Fine… Finish him Am I still just…me I said I was going to become strong But did I just fight blindly and rush forward senselessly Ichigo…said he fights in order to protect Is that his strength What do I have  And why do I fight Damn you… I cant let you have your way any further He escaped my spell in such a short time… Just who is this man Youre protecting me Whats the meaning of this It means nothing Im just being me And youre a part of me Thats all There you go spouting out nice words again Now that Old Man Zangetsu is gone, I dont know what you plan to do to me And I dont know what I want to do with myself But theres one thing to do You know that, dont you Youre so irritating Such a strange scene You, protecting a Hollows power Sure, he may have been a Hollow once But hes a part of me now What I do with him is my business and Im fine with it But I dont intend to let a perfect stranger have his way! Ichigo Kurosaki, just what are you Your speech and conduct surely are not those of a Soul Reaper towards a Hollow Your name is Muramasa, right Well, youre wrong about one thing Ive said it many times, but Im not a Soul Reaper Im human! You intend to thrust me out with your own will! Ichigo Kurosaki… You are an interesting fellow indeed Sorry to keep you waiting You may be right that Im weak I had forgotten But I dont have time to ramble on about such rubbish Rubbish I want to become strong Thats all I will take myself back The only way to do that is to get Old Man Zangetsu back Even if it means destroying him… Theres someone I must win against So I have to become strong, whatever the cost! You two made me remember that That is how I truly feel In order to do that, whatever happens… – I cannot lose! – I cannot lose! Roar! Zabimaru! Here I come! What do you want! You said to Roar, Zabimaru Right, Snake Yeah, so I roared Shall I roar again No! Shut up!

Who the hell are you A Zanpakuto killing his owner… I find that to be quite a sick joke K-Kira… You continue to amuse me, Ichigo Kurosaki I never expected to become so interested in a single Soul Reaper And youre incredibly talkative You keep droning on and on Im done talking Lets settle this! So it comes to this, Old Man Zangetsu! Im going to fight to get you back Even if I have to fight you My feelings wont change What about you! I want to know You or I… Which one of us is truly the strongest… If I can find that out, I will gladly cross blades with you Without Zangetsus power within your Zanpakuto, you cant fight like you normally do I will lend you my power for now In exchange, you won’t be able to use the power of your mask Remember that Bankai! Watch out, Snake I know that Did something about him change Looks like it Sorry, but Im going to put an end to this! Zanpakuto should stick to being used by their owners The way it should be What did you say! What kind of arrogant nonsense is that Wait Thats quite an impressive thing to say It looks like you finally have the will to fight us I dont just have the will Im going to thrash you head on! Dont get ideas, Renji Thats right! Dont get cocky! Huh Do you think you can beat us if you have the will to fight No matter what you do, were stronger! Want a taste of it Taste of what Your blade Kira… Why… Hisagi… You shouldnt move Your wounds are pretty deep Even so… I cant leave you with the task of disposing him I don’t want to do this either But having a lieutenant die before we can find a way to resolve this problem is far worse Im not just here to help you Our mission is to put down the Zanpakuto rebellion! Kira… Another idiot has come along, eh That’s fine by me I don’t care which one of you dies first After all, my desire is to hunt down as many lives as possible Youre a Zanpakuto with pleasant interests And youre a stupidly honest Soul Reaper!

Im difficult to handle All right, lets go! Our Bankai is not like your shoddy one We have no blind spots! This match is over Your Shikai is no match for my Bankai! Now you understand You cannot defeat us Sh-Shut up! Damn it… Its true that my Shikai is no match for her Bankai… Furthermore,  shes reading my attacks She knows my usual attack pattern, so I guess it makes sense What should I do You dont have brains, so thinking about this is pointless Of all your weaknesses, your intelligence is the weakest, Renji My weakness… Ill give it a try… What should we do, Monkey He probably realizes that fighting any longer is pointless Bakudo 4: Hainawa!

You guys… Weve come to our senses We wont continue this silly battle anymore Whats going on Muramasa… It appears he was controlling us Zanpakuto by awakening our urges and inciting them Are you saying that all the other Zanpakuto are under his control Its very likely Ichigo… You saved me this time My other self helped too What are you going to do now Its obvious Im going after Muramasa Thats all I see Ichigo Kurosaki… He might be the one… It’s all thanks to me that you won this battle!

Are you ready An old lady like you cant beat me! Arent you going to come at me Do you think Ill come back to you if you keep waiting like that Why do you always think in ways that suit your own view Thats why people use and betray you If you wait, do you think that person you admire will come back to beg for your forgiveness Take that! And that! And that! If you dont run away quickly, youre going to be bald! I have a nice head shape I think Id look good, even without hair Enough of your cockiness You should run away quickly Or are you unable to move because of your fat ass Were you always this talkative I had no idea Growl!

Maybe youre not careful enough! – Whats wrong with them – I almost had her back there, – It looks like – and you ruined it! – they dont get along – Like thats my problem! – Thats right! – Thats right! – Do you have a problem with that! – Do you have a problem with that! Good grief Where are you, Byakuya Have you hidden your Spiritual Pressure Whats this I sense some sort of presence, but I cant tell if its far or near What is it This presence… What is it Where have I felt it before There! Who the hell are you! Youre Ichigo Kurosaki, arent you Yeah How do you know my name You seem fairly skilled What of it Muramasa said to keep away from you Me Why Thats what I want to know too Bankai! A Bankai Yeah! What of it Is that sword a Zanpakuto Yeah A Zanpakuto… What is its name What do mean Whats wrong You are not my master What are you saying If you arent my master, I have no business with you Hey Dont you know whose Zanpakuto you are No I dont know who my master is… And I dont know my name You… Sennen Hyoro What! Farewell Hyorinmaru! Its Hyorinmaru! Toshiro! Your name is Hyorinmaru! And you are my Zanpakuto! Hyorinmaru, have you lost your memory Thats right I cant remember anything What a coincidence I cant remember anything, either Who am I I remember the first three bars… Yours is simply from having too much booze Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! Huh This is the hot-water supply room Oh Sorry Im completely lost It happens when youre with a squad other than your own Thats so true Kyoraku You see I got lost too And I wound up in Unohanas private quarters What!

You always turn your back towards reality! Face reality! What are you trying to say! You were betrayed! By the person you trusted most! I was by your side watching that, unable to say anything And it really annoyed me! I see I cant stand it anymore Youre going to destroy yourself if this keeps up Even though I was by your side What a thing to say So what do you want to do I want to put you poor thing to sleep forever Sleep Oh, Im sorry I forgot youve already been asleep for quite some time now Does it hurt Yes Thats the pain of reality Its nothing like the naive world you believe it to be Im going to make you discard those ideas! Stop being so overconfident, old lady! What did you say! Hinamori! Ouch! What are you doing! How long are you going to think youre good looking Women have an expiration date And youre past expiration You brat! Enough is enough! Try and make me! Owowowow! What are you doing! I was just trying to help you look sexier Of course, you couldnt please anyone since youre already expired Perhaps you shouldnt push yourself, old lady! Unforgivable! Theres one more thing I want to tell you All of the friends you trust are just an illusion You just believe theyre your friends Everyone just acts as if theyre your friends because they have their position to think of Take Rangiku Matsumoto there for example… The only thing shes interested in is herself As proof, shes not paying any attention to you Why are you getting so upset If you werent an old lady, you wouldnt care! Its really unsightly! Die! Good bye, old lady! The one who reigns! Mask of flesh and blood… – All creation, the flutter of wings, – Its useless, useless, – who crowns us names! – useless! Disintegrate, you black dog of Rondanini! – What are you trying to do – Look upon yourself and burn! Tear out your own throat! Bakudo 9! Horin! What do you think youre aiming at Pay attention to me! Shakkaho! Where are you aiming! Old la— Bakudo 9! Horin! Oh, no! Hey… What! Dont press yourself against me! Im not doing it because I want to! – Ouch! We did it, Hinamori! We sure did, Rangiku! Whats the meaning of this, old lady Dont tell me, that was all an act Of course Id never take a brat like you seriously In order to go up against your Zanpakuto powers, we needed to catch you off guard You were only paying attention to your own enemy, so we were able to pull it off You two suit each other! Youve got to be kidding me! You should try to get along a little better Shut up! But listening to you… I feel sorry for you two What You only think about yourself and never think of others Thats not true! Is that so Dont pay any attention to her Shes just sore because shes an old lady Quit calling me an old lady! You think so I want to grow old Huh! Being young isnt appealing Being young means that your heart is shallow So whenever you admire someone or youre betrayed, you feel as if youre flying or drowning Your emotions get the better of you and you lose sight of where you belong Growing old means that your heart is gaining depth Youre able to step away from your wild emotions and keep those thoughts of flying or sinking within you Thats what it means to grow old Expiration date sounds shallow Dont use it when referring to a womans age You… What are you talking about Children like you cant understand Yeah, yeah Thats very admirable Yeah Its absurd, isnt it Hey, what is it Why are you getting sulky! Thats my own business! Yeah, you just do whatever you want! What! You have no business telling me that! Jeez, youre not cute at all! Shut up! Your name is Hyorinmaru! And I, Toshiro Hitsugaya, am your master! Dont make me laugh A child like you cannot be my master Are you serious Youve forgotten me Do you really think Id believe such nonsense, boy Did that weird guy, Muramasa, do anything to you Thats none of your business But when I was released from my master, I lost all of my memories All of your memories Right now, Im working for Muramasa, but my goal is to find my true master Your true master Thats right Because of my enormous power, the person who uses me must be the most powerful Soul Reaper Its probably not a child like you Its true that my power hasnt peaked… But that doesnt change the fact that I am your owner! If you insist on saying that youre my master, then show me proof Bakudo 63! Sajosabaku! Its useless What! Toshiro! Damn it! Stop, Hyorinmaru! Im the one youre fighting! Hado 31! Shakkaho! I said its useless Dont you get it Zanpakuto… I hear that the Zanpakuto were released from the Soul Reapers to fulfill their desires If thats the case, Hyorinmaru, what is your desire My desire Thats right Your desire What does your soul want Have you forgotten even that! That would be…a place to call my own…a home A home I might be searching for a home A home… My home… Theyre afraid of me I havent done anything But everyone is afraid of me Is it my silver hair Is it my bluish green eyes Or is it my cold disposition Im going to buy some amanatto Youre out of it, arent you Grandma has gotten pretty thin Grandma began getting thin when I began to have those dreams Sweets Your change is 3 kan Thanks If thats all you want, then get going Hey, you!

I dont know Were testing that right now Now then… Hey, stop! Seriously, stop! What is it Even if he is a sample, hes the only Zanpakuto weve captured at the moment! Shouldnt we treat him a little better You sure are noisy I guess we have no choice Nemu Yes, Master Mayuri Why me! What was that, tsk, just now! How can you stab at me with such lack of emotion! And Im not the one you should be cutting open! You should be doing that to my Zanpakuto! YOU BASTARD! WERENT YOU TRYING TO SAVE ME! Shut up!   Its better than getting cut open myself! Oh You can share your thoughts with your Zanpakuto even if its mouth is covered The connection between a Soul Reaper and his manifested Zanpakuto is very interesting R-Right! Soul Reapers and Zanpakuto! Such a relationship isnt easy to understand It would be such a waste to experiment on us! Thats not true Huh Hes dead Hes dead What is this! What are you saying! What are you going to do about my Zanpakuto! According to my report, when a Zanpakuto is killed by its owner, they go back to normal Thats right But it appears that is not the case when someone other than its owner kills them Huh! Youre ignoring me! Im the owner, but youre ignoring me! Please be quiet in the lab Be quiet You seem to be after my life! Be quiet Stop that! Whoa! – Be quiet – Thats dangerous! Hey!

Toshiro Yes Is my captain all right Dont worry My master hit me with everything he had and restored my memory Let him rest for a while Honestly… My captain sure is hopeless But Hitsugaya must be quite relieved It still has not accustomed to my body… Hey… So we meet again I knew youd come, Ichigo Kurosaki What the hell are you talking about I think we might be connected by a deep bond A deep bond Thats right Your power will be useful in achieving my goal You know, dont you Your excess power doesnt have anywhere to go No, I dont know I only know one thing That I will defeat you That is our bond How foolish This technique…!

Why are you doing this Stand back I get it You have the same Spiritual Pressure as Byakuya Youre the one who attacked me last night You dont want to answer me Oh well… In that case… Above… Do you think thats enough to hit me!

You just dont get it! Youre the one who doesnt get it! Thats enough Byakuya! Captain Kuchiki! Captain Kuchiki had gone missing Why is he here Sorry, Byakuya… Im fighting your Zanpakuto Step aside, Kurosaki Are you going to fight him Its probably appropriate if you fight him, but… Thats not what I meant What Hado 33, Sokatsui! W-Why! Captain Kuchiki! Whats going on! Hey, Byakuya! Ichigo Kurosaki… I cannot let you kill this man What Why Why are you taking Muramasas side Dont tell me you surrendered to that Zanpakuto! Surrender I would never surrender to a Zanpakuto This is my own decision The Zanpakuto followed their desires and made their intentions known You and many other Soul Reapers witnessed the Zanpakuto release themselves This is the same thing I am following my own desires This Soul Reaper says interesting things Then let me ask you, Soul Reaper, what are your desires What is your intent My desire… I want to defend my pride Thats all Kurosaki… Dont interfere with Muramasa anymore Or else… …you will die!

" Zanpakuto… Their shape and abilities are based on their Soul Reapers soul Soul Reapers gain power by learning their names and synergizing with them They are born with Soul Reapers and die with Soul Reapers That is what Zanpakuto are What do you mean, Ichigo! Dont go making irresponsible comments! Stop it, Lieutenant Abarai I beg your pardon, Captain Kyoraku, but Captain Kuchiki would never betray us! There has to be some reason! I dont know what the reason is… But its a fact that Byakuya turned his sword on us My goodness… Old Man Yama goes missing, and now theres Captain Kuchikis betrayal Who knows what other surprises await us Captain… The one bright bit of news is that Captain Hitsugayas Zanpakuto has returned But in his condition, he wont be able to fight for quite some time We now know how to regain our Zanpakuto, but if we suffer that much damage each time we do it… With regard to that, there was a distressing report from Squad 12 Results of tests on the samples we took show that a manifested Zanpakuto, when destroyed by someone other than its wielder, might never fully return to how it once was Thats terrible! Then what should we do when were fighting against someone elses Zanpakuto! I guess well have to go easy Theyre not opponents we can beat that way… The enemy seems bent on having us destroy our own Zanpakuto If I may… I think we should keep Captain Kuchikis situation a secret from all but captain-level personnel… No, keeping it a secret would only raise speculation and create problems by spreading unrest They say you cant keep people from talking How will we explain this to Rukia Ill do that Captain Ukitake… Kuchiki will have to accept the truth Brother did that Yes… Byakuya Kuchiki has joined the Zanpakuto Although it could be that he had his own ideas… Yes, Im aware of that Brother… Byakuya Kuchiki… Whats this guy doing here Whats going on Muramasa, whats the meaning of this Why did you help me Senbonzakura… Why would a man of your caliber turn against the Soul Reapers Turned against the Soul Reapers! You mean he sided with us I acted based on my own pride Pride my foot! I cant believe that! But he helped us as well What What Whats going on Whatre you…going to do Were here because weve grown weary of the Soul Reapers Youll put us in a bind if you ask to join us Thats for sure Wed lose our reason to be acting up Byakuya Kuchiki, if you are indeed serious about betraying the Soul Reapers, then show us proof What is it you want me to do Slay your sister-in-laws Zapakuto, Sodenoshirayuki, right here and now Just a minute! Whatre you talking about! You want him to slay one of us! It seems that a Zanpakuto killed by someone other than its wielder never returns to its original form Can this man go so far as to do such a thing So thats it… He loves his younger sister, Rukia Kuchiki, more than anything… Theres no way he could slay her Zanpakuto Thats…! You never intended to let him join us from the start Of course not! The farce ends here Ill settle this with you right here! You want her slain, you say Hey…is he for real Tsuginomai! Hakuren! Hado 4: Byakurai! Is he serious! Even if you seriously fight me, can you really defeat me in your present condition Somenomai! Tsukishiro! Tsukishiro! Stealth Hoho… Shiho 3… Utsusemi Rikujokoro How can this be If it is for the sake my pride… …there is nothing I wont slay This cant be! Are you out of your mind! You could never comprehend my pride What! Dont mess with us! Thats enough Muramasa… A Soul Reaper whos lost her Zanpakuto is as good as dead Knowing that, he callously snapped his sister-in-laws sword… I accept your resolve But… Stop it, Kazeshini If Muramasa says its all right, lets accept that I wont forget this! If you show any unusual actions, I will slay you without hesitation! Know that Ill always be following you! Now then, Byakuya Kuchiki If you are going to be joining us, there is something I want you to do… Thanks, Renji Dont mention it! There might be some clues in the captains office Rukia, the captain will return without fail Theres no way he would betray us Yeah… I believe that too Lieutenant Abarai Were ready to change shifts, sir Okay Be right there! Rukia, dont work yourself too hard yet! I know See you Brother… You always sat alone, Brother… What were you thinking about I mustve dozed off… This Spiritual Pressure! Brother… Rukia This is… Brother… What are you doing here Or rather… Where have you been Answer me, Brother! This is his answer! What! Youre… Sodenoshirayuki! I dont feel any Spiritual Pressure… Could it be…! Without Sodenoshirayuki, you have no means to fight No way… Do not get involved any further What do you mean He means this! Renji! Damn! Captain! What is the meaning of this! Is it true that youre on their side! Captain Kuchiki… Im detaining you as a material witness in the Zanpakuto Rebellion case Forget it Youre no match for me right now Shut up! Damn it! Roar— I heard you used Higazekko in a previous fight… That would mean that you cannot even use Shikai with that sword Who cant use Shikai, you say You two! Whether or not Renji can use Shikai has nothing to do with us now that weve manifested Thats right Ill handle this You go to Muramasa Ohh…youre going to take us on In that case, shall we settle our unfinished business right here today Dont get conceited Dont think youll give me a good fight with your skill level Dont underestimate our strength! Lets do it, Snake! Right with you, Monkey! Roar! Youre not getting away! Brother! Im not done with you! I dont have time to deal with you I see that talking to you is no use… Shakkaho!

You know, your friend should coordinate his Shihakusho too, dont you think Huh He has highlights on his eyes, so his kimono should match his eyes If he considers bald to be stylish, then he should accent that with a ribbon And also, you and he should wear matching feather accessories Yes! I think thats great! How about a flower print on our kimono Nice! Huh "
" Zanpakuto… Their shape and abilities are based on their Soul Reapers soul Soul Reapers gain power by learning their names and synergizing with them They are born with Soul Reapers and die with Soul Reapers That is what Zanpakuto are What is this! Dont move! Were taking you into custody! Bankai! Getsugatensho! We dont want you to think that this is all weve got Hado 31: Shakkaho! I am Third Seat in Zaraki Squad… Im Ikkaku Madarame! Lieutenant Iba! Oh, Lieutenant Kotetsu Whats the situation Captain Soi Fon and the others are engaged in a battle at the Squad 6 barracks Im told Stealth Force has the enemy surrounded and is preventing them from moving I see Then we should join them there, as well Yes… It seems there are many wounded What is it What happened There! What is that Thats probably…  the Ashisogijizo… How can you tell How shall I put it Its very distinctive Huh Is it answering us At any rate, a Zanpakuto has decided to show itself Lets capture it! Wait! Thats…poison What! This is bad! We gotta get away quickly! Hado 1! Sho! We have to inform Captain Kurotsuchi immediately! Right! I wont let you Youre! Thats right Its started to rain My power is thunder and lightning It is in this rain that I display my true powers! Whats so funny If Im not mistaken, your Zanpakuto was Tenken, wasnt it Is it okay to get so wet in the rain No need to worry! Theres no way this amount of rain could extinguish Tenkens flames of hell! What you just said makes it sound like youre not that strong Tenken Yes, I see! Youre saying that these rain clouds are nothing more than a means to reinforce my technique, and that even if the rain itself is weak, I have nothing to worry about, right I, Gonryomaru, am unworthy… I allowed myself to be tricked by her sophistry… I am ashamed… How are you able to communicate through such an exchange Are you using some sort of code Silence! Tenken is extremely shy! Thats nothing to boast about! Are you really captain-level Zanpakuto Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Stop mocking us! Youre not getting away! Is this the level of your true powers Dont underestimate us! Now to finish you! What! Your powers seem to be for real This isnt going to be easy… Gotcha! That was so close! I almost got the second strike in! Is this the first time you were struck by this technique yourself Yay! Are you…Suzumebachi! Ding ding ding! Thats correct! What do you think of this look I didnt really like your lame style So I thought, if I ever got free, I would create my own look and make myself look sharp! Im really glad I was able to manifest myself the way I wanted to look What Do you have a problem with that Your problem is that all you ever do in your free time is worship Yoruichi Are you stupid or something If you have that much free time, you should pay more attention to your clothes and find yourself a good man! This…is my Zanpakuto If you cant believe that I am, then maybe another strike with this will convince you! Youre not as tough as you talk! Youre kinda weak… You annoy me! Damn it! Whyre you looking at me that way You… Ill never forgive you! Thats okay, you dont have to Come on… Why dont you give up already If you give up now, Id be at least willing to spare your life… Im never giving up! Listen… Have you noticed the Spiritual Pressure around here Earlier, Ikkaku Madarames Spiritual Pressure disappeared, didnt it Ikkaku… You people cant defeat us with the level of your abilities Ikkaku didnt lose! Hozukimarus Spiritual Pressure disappeared too! In all probability, Hozukimaru tailored his to match his opponents fighting level… Those two are quite alike, you know But Im different Unlike you, I have no hesitation at all in using this power in public Stop it! Nope… Tear in Frenzy… Well How does it feel to be struck by the power you so loathe I…dont want everyone to know about this power… I wont be able to stay in Squad 11… Are you still saying that You truly are stubborn… Squad…11… Still talking about that! Shut up…Fujikujaku! I see… Sorry! What were you doing! That woman is your target! Keep her in check! Why do I have to back you up! Because its only right! We lost last time because you didnt hold up your end! Oh, really Wasnt it because – youre a bonehead – Whatre those two doing – Oh, you make me so mad! – Who knows – You never take responsibility! – Whatever – Let me just tell you that – Lets get out of here while we can! – its always your fault… – La, la, la, I cant hear you! Stop! Youre not getting away! And you show yourself, too! Oh no! Hado 31: Shakkaho! Kotetsu! Are you okay, Kotetsu No you dont Iba! I cant move my legs… Oh You dont know the power of Ashisogijizo The Ashisogijizo deprives its victims of the ability to move their limbs You were struck by its attack and lost the use of your legs… You are like a little bird clipped of its wings Where am I Youre… You shouldnt strain yourself When you got me back, your body paid a huge price Whats the situation Muramasa and the others staged an all-out attack The Soul Reapers are battling them now I see… Then I cant stay here in bed… Believe in them The Soul Reapers arent so weak that theyd perish because of something like this You demonstrated that to me, Master Kotetsu! Its no use, mister! Lieutenant Hinamori! Isane! Whats the big idea Hi! Darn! You two again! Were not letting the two of you get away this time! Thats what we were going to say Last time we just let down our guard! Old lady! Still the same rude little girls, I see! Matsumoto! This is dangerous! Lets get out of here! The tables have turned, old lady! Renji! Brother! Please stop it! Damn! Ikkakus Spiritual Pressure disappeared… Yumichikas in danger, as well Dammit! Getsugatensho! Yahoo! Bakudo 39: Enkosen! Youve got a quick reaction! But no matter how hard you fight by yourself, it wont change this battle setting Feel the Spiritual Pressure around you! Were overwhelming you Youre giving me that glare that makes me sick! Ill gouge out those eyes of yours! Is it okay…to repeatedly unleash so many direct attacks What What do you mean You should know the power of my Zanpakuto, right What about it You didnt regain your Shikai, did you! Answer, you coward! You cant expect me to answer that… Something must be wrong with you Come to think of it, the guys done nothing but fend off my attacks and never tried to attack from his side But… Why go through all that tedious stuff when he couldve just done a Shikai Hes bluffing! Whats the matter Shut up! The bastard did it again! Over here You cant do a Shikai! Even if you did regain your powers, Ill cut your life short faster than you can do Shikai! Hado 58! Tenran! I should answer your question I havent regained Shikai yet But you lost the moment you got caught in the maze of doubt You… Bakudo 63: Sajosabaku Okay Id better hurry and help the others… Your back is totally unguarded Wabisuke… Oh no! Youre finished… Kira! Whatre you looking at Out of my way! Out of my way! Dammit! Arent Kyoraku and Ukitake joining us in battle Ah! Uh… Captain is… I see…theyre commanding things from the barracks! So this pinch were in is part of the plan! Uh yes…you can rest assured I forgot to inform them… Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers I win I lost… Come on, one more game Im on a roll today! Im looking forward to this… Hey, are you okay Yeah…its just something in my throat… Hello, is anyone here SILENCE Isnt there anyone here! "
" Zanpakuto… Their shape and abilities arebased  on their Soul Reapers soul Soul Reapers gain power by learning their names and synergizing with them They are born with Soul Reapers and die with Soul Reapers That is what Zanpakuto are Id better hurry and help the others Your back is totally unguarded Youre finished… What was that Thats… This Spiritual Pressure… Thats right You remember it, dont you It belongs to the leader of our Squad 11… Captain Kenpachi Zaraki Kenpachi! Looks like you guys are doing this in bits and pieces, Ichigo What a way to finally show up Not only are you late, but to make this big a spectacle of it… Shut up I rushed to get here before you guys finished things up So what if I made a mess So… I hope you left my play buddy for me, like you were supposed to… Okay then, Ill go and do as I please Youre in my way… I dont like it… Hey Youre trying to kill me with this dull thing I dont have time to be bothered with someone of your level How can this be! In…credible… It instantly turned back into a sword… Thats the outcome of a Zanpakuto slain by someone other than its wielder The relationship between a Zanpakuto and a Soul Reaper is one of communication, synergy, and subjugation However, when a third party becomes involved, that relationship can no longer be Let that be a lesson to all of you as well You sure talk big… Next! Just what I expected from the captain of Squad 11, the combat unit He snapped a Zanpakuto just like that… But his Spiritual Pressure is rough and too ugly It doesnt appeal to me… Dont you feel the same way What do you mean Im afraid you and I are very much alike Very much alike Thats right We both live according to our sense of aesthetics Beauty above all… But you were in the wrong place I mean, youre among those slow-witted, boorish, hot-blooded people If you unleashed your true power, theyd only make fun of you You cant be worrying about aesthetics, right Being unable to expose your own technique to Kenpachi Zaraki and Ikkaku Madarame… In time, that in itself, became an aesthetic to you… It cant be helped A halfhearted narcissist is always  concerned about how people see him What is it youre trying to say Im saying that someone like you, who wont accept his own powers  for fear of how people will see him can never win against someone like  me who believes in his own powers You really do talk a lot I dont want to hear that from you Now…shall we end it about now See you…Master Kenpachi Zaraki, eh Indeed…with that kind of Spiritual Pressure, I can understand how he took care of Wabisuke with a single blow… Maybe it was simply because Wabisuke was an idiot— attacking carelessly the way he did Zaraki Where were you hiding until now Hiding I dont like how that sounds… Okay! Then Ill explain! Ken went to get rid of some Hollows that appeared in the outskirts of the Rukon District When he got word, he tried to hurry back, but along the way, he became totally lost and ended up being this late! Dont blabber unnecessary things, Yachiru! But its the truth! We even passed right by the sweets shop we found along the way, up on the ridge! Thats why I said wed go there next time! Promise! What is this lack of tension Im going on a little rampage Get down Okay! Now then… Who among you here is the strongest Looks like we have a troublemaker… It appears so Leave this to me What You go Bankai So impudent! A lowly Zapakuto shouldnt get cocky! What is this Spiritual Pressure! So this is Kenpachi Zaraki! Its impressive no matter how many times Ive seen it! Captain Zaraki! What! W-What power! Cant withstand… the Spiritual Pressure! Youre in the way Seems like its begun For that much Spiritual Pressure to reach this far… That man really is exceptional But… Youll only be able to feel his Spiritual Pressure for only a few moments more… I like that expression Everyone is frightened and pained in death I hope you die beautifully Ive decided Decided…you say Thats right… What did you decide Are you about to tell me that youve decided to accept death gracefully Its a little late for that Wrong Thats not what I decided I decided to defeat you Oh Its indeed true that I was concerned about what the other captains and Ikkaku might think Right That was simply because you were so concerned with others views that it confused your position on aesthetics Wrong I would rather die than have people see the release of Ruriirokujaku But thats not all there is to it! This cant be! The greater the Spiritual Pressure, the faster the flowers grow and  the closer you should be to death! I know! But… Hado 31: Shakkaho! You released a considerable amount of Spiritual Pressure in order to cull out the others I suppose it had to have been taxing on your body, as well… That doesnt matter Doesnt matter Thats right I never had any intention from the start of taking on the small fry… I am forever a member of the strongest fighting squad among the Thirteen Court Guard Squads… Im a member of Squad 11! Whatever happens to my body, I will do whatever it takes to fight you… The captain and I will stake our pride to continue fighting… And if I should fall trying, then… – laugh at me! – laugh at me! Wheres Ichigo Looks like he was blown away like the rest of us… We cant have any more people who will stand in Byakuyas way! Not a single one of you guys know when to give up! T-Tenken! Im ashamed to say, I cant get up Would you mind lending me a hand Are you trying to destroy me, too! Scattering so much Spiritual Pressure around… Cant that guy fight a quiet battle Youre good A surprise attack Nice tactic With such bad footing, I cant keep up with her movements This no time for me to be fighting a quiet battle, either… Running away Im changing location Follow me! How shall we do this Shall I attack first Or…do you want to come at me first I dont have time to be facing off against you Is that so In that case, Ill attack first! Lets have fun! Byakuya Kuchiki! Scatter… Thats not working Dont disappoint me too much! Did you think I couldnt see through your Flash Step Did you think you could capture me with your speed How fun… Looks like your speed is only good for running away! Laughable Do you see now You cannot capture me… Is that so Caught you! Is that all the attack you can muster! How the combat squad, Squad 11, has fallen! Damn! I used up a considerable amount  of Spiritual Pressure to  escape from those vines! I know… Your Spiritual Pressure has gotten weaker You shouldnt do rash things You talk too much! Just as I expected of you… You dodged at the very last moment You… Whyre you doing all this Because I thought that unless I did, you wouldnt give me your best… I see… Scatter… Impressive… Im unable to even do a Shikai… Even if I continue to run,  theres nothing more I can do… I never thought Id suffer because I couldnt use Ruriirokujaku Looks like youre out of options If you dont mind, shall I let you use the power of my Ruriirokujaku That would be fair, wouldnt it No thanks I thought so Then would it be fair if I didnt use it either Yes…would you do that for me If you dont use that power— despite all that talk about aesthetics and all that— it means that you lack confidence… In the power of your Kido techniques Now youve said it All right Ill do as you say Ill fight to the end using my sense of aesthetics Unfortunately for you, I can use the techniques any number of times Tear in Frenzy… You told me earlier… To laugh at you if pride brings you back to your feet but you still fall Well, I intend to laugh to the fullest Bakudo 4! Hainawa! What! Youre using Bakudo! This ends it I got lucky since you, like me, are stubborn and overconfident If you had fought a normal fight, I wouldve had no chance of winning True, we are so alike its almost repulsive Id rather die than have you reveal  the release of Ruriirokujaku But thats not all there is to it If you wont release Ruriirokujaku,  then I will make sure that I win… That is my aesthetic Dont concern yourself with me any further… Otherwise, next time Ill be forced to take your life… Take my life, you say Fine! Go ahead and try! Ive always wanted  to have a swordfight to the death with you! Youre finally on board! Come at me with that spirit… Byakuya Kuchiki! I see Then you leave me no choice Kenpachis Zanpakuto doesnt manifest! Of course not! If it manifested, Soul Society would be destroyed without the story arc moving forward! So its one of those backstage circumstances Exactly Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! Suzumebachi has gone somewhere as well… Who the heck are we supposed to fight now On the other hand, I dont feel like fighting those guys… Tenken! Would you mind burying me back into the rubble Im going to lay low and wait for an enemy! Okay, this is perfect! Hey! "

Wait, Rukia! Let go, Renji! I must go to my brother! Oh no! What is that Byakuya! You! Damn… Wha— W-Wait… How long do you intend to keep running! You dodged that nicely You thought you couldnt dodge it, so you used your arm in that instant to counter That was a smart decision, but you just gave me more targets This time what shall I aim for Why Our speed should be equal And yet… Is it so strange that you cant catch up with me What You, the fastest Reaper in Soul Society, and I, your Zanpakuto, are just about equal in speed But while my attacks make direct hits, your attacks keep missing me Oh dear, oh dear! Thats written all over your face Thats why youre completely hopeless Too bad! I wonder what itll take to get me Ill bet youve never fought with anyone smaller than you When equal in speed, the one who is smaller, me, will have the advantage Isnt that common sense Your thinking is way too biased Why, even the way you feel about Yoruichi… When shes gone, you hate her When she returns, you tag along wherever she goes Dont you ever walk the middle ground What would you know about Yoruichi! A lot! I was your Zanpakuto Shes the one making you rot! Whats with that look Oh, did I upset you You cant quite get me, can you Your attacks never work, do they Well, Ill deliver the finishing blow! Can you keep up with my moves Where shall I strike the final blow Right here! W-What! Th-This is… W-Why I concentrated the power of Shunko  around the Homonka you aimed for A sword will not penetrate it Sorry, but I do not rely solely on my Zanpakuto That is what I was taught, how I trained to get to this point What Found you! Is this hide-and-seek Oh! Found you again! Yay! Now lets play tag! Wait, wait! Gotcha! Ban…k… Hey, thanks for interfering with my fight Because of you, Kuchiki got away So how are you gonna make up for that Huh! What the That is my Zanpakuto You cant just do whatever you please with it It is my duty to administer the punishment for betraying its master Why you— I must get back quickly Looks like you had a rough time Y-Yoruichi! What is it, Soi Fon Stop! Please, not that! – What are you saying – Let go! Your body has been infused with a deadly poison You must be treated quickly, or it will be too late I dont need that stuff! Ive already heard that your treatments dont really work! Goodness! Who told you such a thing Ishida! Ishida told me! Oh… That Quincy I knew I should have restructured him too, so that he wouldnt talk unnecessarily Too Did you just say too Which means, you intended to restructure me too! You talk too much! I just meant that since Im treating you anyway, I can restructure you without charge You should be grateful! Why would I be happy being injected with something thats totally suspicious! Nemu! What! Whats going on! – Hey! – Please calm down Hold him down, Nemu – Let go! – Yo I dont care what you do to him, as long as hes still able to fight me Kenpachi… Hey, dont just stand there Stop him! Why I dont care if youre a machine or a monster As long as I can have fun fighting with you Why you— Hang in there, Icchi! By the way, how come the poison isnt affecting you two Well… Umm… We held our breath so that we wouldnt breathe in the poison, so we were fine! Strange… The poison is supposed to enter your body whether its breathed in or not Maybe it doesnt work on idiots Or, I bet its that… Ill bet Captain Zarakis Spiritual Pressure repelled the poison Kyoraku! Ukitake! Sorry were late Are you all right Captain Kurotsuchi… Thank you for tending to everyone Squad 4 will take over from here Im saved! Please be quiet Let me go! My poison cannot be so easily treated by those unfamiliar with it Please rest assured We just treated Isane and the others who had been attacked by Ashisogijizo… Weve already analyzed its contents That was unwarranted! Next time, Ill come up with a poison that even you, Captain Unohana, cannot analyze so quickly Im looking forward to it What are these two sparring about Captain Unohana… You said the Ashisogijizo attacked Yes… before coming here, Konjiki Ashisogijizo infiltrated the Seireitei Hado 31, Shakkaho! Ban…kai… Oh no! Its catching up to us! Hinamori! Im sorry… I think the poison has taken effect… You…always overdo it Im glad it went well… Hinamori! Whats wrong! Rangiku! Matsumoto! Kotetsu! Not me too Fortunately, Ashisogijizo went on its rampage close to the Squad 4 barracks The four are being treated there now Their lives are not in danger They should recover after some bed rest Thank you, Unohana Captain Unohana! Lieutenant Kira was discovered between the collapsed buildings In addition, we found Third Seat Madarame in a corner of the courtyard and Fifth Seat Ayasegawa beyond the forest— all of them unconscious! I understand Everyone, I can handle things here Please go ahead – Yes maam! – Yes maam! Hey, what about your Zanpakuto Was it okay to break it It doesnt matter This was necessary in order to explicate the way the Zanpakuto are being brainwashed Huh So earlier, you made it submit Hardly It simply self-destructed Its no different from that ruffian breaking Wabisuke Then you… Quiet already I broke it in order to discover new information And its none of your business You dont care about losing your own sword for the sake of an experiment Of course not! Youre so reliable at times like this Kuchiki, are you all right Im sorry to cause you concern Its fine Just stay still Yes… You couldnt stop Byakuya No… Just what… does he intend to do Good work… Are you heading for the World of the Living Follow me Now then… I guess Ill go Where are you going, Zaraki Isnt it obvious Im gonna find Kuchiki and challenge him Ken, that sounds like fun! You wont find him just searching blindly Yoruichi! Yoruichi Shihoin, youre back They really did a number on this place So, do you know where they are No! What! But Ive located the Head Captains whereabouts Wanna go Its here Renji, do you know where my broken Sodenoshirayuki is Speaking of which, Zabimaru is missing too Oh, Captain Kurotsuchi took them all He said hes going to repair them Thats good—What!

Dont make him change his Spiritual Pressure! Dont blame us if you get blown away by his fluctuating Spiritual Pressure! Yeah! They dont really listen to me Its quite troublesome for the Head Captain Byakuya! You… Damn it! What… Wait… Old Man Yamas whereabouts! Is that true! Well, its just the most likely place the Head Captain would be But I found the Head Captains Spiritual Pressure there again What should we do Theres not much point in waiting for them to come to us Its not in our nature to wait, after all Lets go, Ken! Lets go! Lets go looking for Old Man! Come on! I think youre confusing this with a game of hide-and-seek Hey The guy I have to slash is probably there, right Yeah, probably But try not to slash the General Captain by mistake That Old Man wouldnt quite rest in peace if hes slashed by accident How about it Will you two be coming with us This is boring Your idea of an interesting day is so exciting that other peoples hearts would stop What a cruel thing to say Its true, isnt it When I was released from my master, I thought that it was the beginning of a more interesting life You were easily defeated by your master too What! That was your fault! I know that The same thing happened to me What is it You seem rather calm today Well, I do agree that this is boring Whos there! Kazeshini Jeez Dont scare us like that! Kazeshini! What is this! Oh, no… These wounds are bad… Yeah Im surprised he was able to come back here What are you doing Im glad you could make it back, Kazeshini Rest up and heal your wounds Muramasa… What is it, Kazeshini Let me ask you one thing Sure You told me to follow my true instincts, right Thats right My true instinct is to reap the lives of Soul Reapers! I know that My goal is to release Zanpakuto from Soul Reapers Then why is there a Soul Reaper over there! Byakuya Kuchiki plays a crucial role in achieving our greater goal With your help, Byakuya was able to make it back safely I am very thankful But why do we have to get hurt for a Soul Reaper! Even though we have a greater goal, it saddens me that people have to get hurt But theres no need to worry As long as we have Genryusai Yamamoto, they cannot do anything to us Were close to achieving our goal They should be getting desperate Sorry, but please hold out for just a little longer This certainly is Genryusais Spiritual Pressure… I also sense some powerful barrier Muramasa must have been unable to control Ryujinjakka and sealed Old Man Yama within a barrier I guess were fortunate that we  didnt have to take on Ryujinjakka Anyway, the Old Man is in here, right Yeah Thats for certain But this cave is like a maze Also… The Zanpakuto appear to be using a different entrance If their hideout is in here, we must be careful What a pain Lets quit talking and just charge on in! Thats right! Go, go! Ken! Go, go! Do it! Go, go! Honestly… Theres no point in making plans when hes around Well, nows not the time to wait and see what theyre going to do We should go too Ichigo, were going in from a different entrance Okay The Soul Reapers have come Yeah Damn it… This sucks I charged in, but its so dark I dont know where Im going Hey, Yachiru! Which way do you think I should go Lets see… That way! I cant see which way youre pointing! I told you, its this way! Stop that, you idiot! Dont pull my ears! Yoruichi What is it Can I ask you one thing Sure Do you think that Byakuya is here Are you that concerned about him, Ichigo Yeah He joined the Zanpakuto and pointed his sword at Rukia and Renji But I dont know why My desire… I want… to defend my pride Thats all But I thought you might know what Byakuya is thinking I dont know, either! What! Ichigo! Simmer down! If you get worked up, youll never be able to bring back Byakuya! He probably has some secret plan But… Oh no! Oh I heard that she was the former commander of the Stealth Force… But she wasnt much of a challenge Stealth Hoho, Shiho 3… Utsusemi!

Ichigo mustve encountered Muramasa That aside, these two are fighting strangely Theyre coming after me,  but I dont think that even they think their attack level is effective I should test them Whats wrong You cant do anything Cant do anything Thats not true Are you still trying to act tough Thats all I would need to do You have no intention of cutting me, do you What are you saying Two swords with different ranges Using that difference is how I fight using my Zanpakuto In other words, thats how you fight But you havent tried to take advantage of that The short sword uses its speed to confuse the enemy and the long sword delivers the final blow This is how Zanpakuto like you are supposed to fight But only the short sword is attacking and the long sword isnt doing anything at all Its as if youre avoiding my attacks Its not that I cant do anything I think youre just defending yourself in a way that I cant do anything My, my… It sure is troublesome to have a skilled master Mister! This way! Follow our clapping! Come out Ill get angry if you dont Thats fine! Try and get angry! – Go! – Go! Hado 31, Shakkaho! All right! I caught you! Damn it… Doing this is just prolonging their pranks Prolonging! Dont you understand, Ichigo Kurosaki Thats not enough to defeat me You cannot move on until you defeat me Come on… Hit me with everything youve got! Okay Here I go! What is this Spiritual Pressure! Who knows What does it matter Anyway, lets end things here! If you can do it, that is… Bring it on Growl! No! Youre not going anywhere! Hado 31! Shakkaho! Snap! Your goal was never to get rid of us You wanted to lure us here and keep us around Thats your goal, isnt it More, Ichigo Kurosaki… I thought I told you to hit me with everything Show it to me! Your true Getsugatensho… Since you figured it out, I guess I have no choice What! Sorry, but even if you slash me, Im going to keep on going You two stay away! We cant do that! Were not letting you go any farther Got that! You kids sure dont listen Dont worry There seems to be a lot going on, but none of it concerns me Ill stay here Lets let loose! Thank goodness! Hado 58! Tenran! Bakudo 30! Shitotsusansen! What are you doing! Their goal was to separate us from Ichigo That I understand But what do they want with Ichigo Kurosaki Judging from Muramasas Spiritual Pressure, I dont think hes attacking to kill If anything,  hes waiting for something Its as if hes trying to make Ichigo settle things If Muramasa is trying to do this on purpose… Muramasas true goal is… Hes waiting for… Ichigos greatest technique! Getsuga… Dont, Ichigo! …tensho! The barrier… So this is why! Whats going on! I dont understand! Muramasas goal was to get you to use your Getsugatensho while Hollowfied What! It seems he fused your power with his own to create a massive amount of energy He was trying to destroy Genryusais barrier with that Destroy! Didnt he create that barrier! It seems weve made a grave mistake Thats right It seems hes gotten the better of us Sensei… His goal is to gain access to my mental world Your mental world Th-Then Muramasa… infiltrated you You planned this scenario to arrive at this moment, didnt you You truly are a Captain-class Soul Reaper Youre quick to understand things Thats right My goal is to learn the memories resting deep within Genryusai Yamamoto In order to do that, I need to enter his mental world But when I appeared, he set up a barrier and severed himself from the area around himself And at the cost of losing consciousness, he prevented me from entering his mind I had expected that So I manifested the Soul Reapers Zanpakuto and caused chaos in Soul Society in order to create a plan to destroy Genryusai Yamamotos barrier in the meantime I made all of the Soul Reapers and Zanpakuto believe that my goal was to cause a Zanpakuto rebellion, and that I had confined Genryusai Yamamoto Then I let things cool down and left you to save Genryusai Yamamoto N-No way… Everything went according to my plan I thank you, Soul Reapers And Ichigo Kurosaki You bastard! Whats the meaning of this! Our goal was a lie and you were using us to  achieve your own goal Would there be a problem if I said that was the case A big problem! Now that I know everything, I have no intention  of complying with you You tricked us… Thats not fair! Liar! Wait Calm down! The Zanpakuto are fighting with each other! Sorry, but Ive gotta go I dont care to talk to you any longer Do whatever you like Well do that! What! What are these flames Ryujinjakka… This is terrible Even Old Man Yamas Ryujinjakka has fallen into his hands Farewell, Genryusai Yamamoto and Soul Reapers There is nothing you can do against me anymore Sensei! What exactly is Muramasa! Muramasa… He is a Zanpakuto with the power of Mukojochu He can enter an enemys Zanpakuto  and control it however he wants He is especially unique! And his true goal must be immediately be stopped by the Thirteen Court Guard Squads! What is a Mukojochu A mukojochu is actually a worm that lives parasitically in the human body Muramasas ability has a similar name because it allows him to get inside of peoples mental worlds, in the same way that the mukojochu worm gets inside of peoples bodies A worm Oh Hey! Dont compare me to a worm! Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! Yoo-hoo! Sado! Say, which outfit would be easiest to fight in Its been a while, so I forget! Huh Anything is fine Take a look, Sado!

Its not easy, but with time, I could control him But we dont have time If we dont hurry up and stop Muramasa, hell dispel the seal The seal What seal! Is that why Muramasa went to Karakura Town! Tell me! What is Muramasa trying to do! Muramasa is after Koga Hes trying to revive the Soul Reaper Koga, the master of the Zanpakuto Muramasa Muramasa is a Zanpakuto that can  enter another persons inner world and control the Zanpakuto that lives within it His master, Koga, once led a rebellion against Seireitei The Zanpakuto controlled by Muramasa not only denied their masters power, they also attacked them and  thrust Soul Society into chaos We suffered great casualties but  finally managed to seal Koga away Muramasas Soul Reaper master… Thats the back story But Muramasa said that he killed his own master Thats one of his lies Koga still lives within the seal even now And the seal is in Karakura Town… Ive never heard about that Its a secret event that was never recorded Then what did Muramasa gain by entering your mind Something only I know— how to free Koga If he becomes one with Koga, he might wipe out the enriched spiritual zone known as Karakura Town!

Me too! What are you doing! I-Its not what you think! My Zanpakuto is moving on its own On its own! Thats impossible W-Whats this W-Whats going on No way… No… No! Raise your head, Koga Kuchiki Yes, sir Your work was magnificent The rebellion is still far from over, but weve taken a big step towards recovery You are too kind The Soul Society is currently in great turmoil But this might be a test to see if  we can permanently bring peace In order to do that, the Soul Society needs young strength like your own Please continue to use your power Yes, sir! I vow to give my life in order to bring peace to this world Did you hear about Sir Koga Yeah, I heard He took out several dozen rebels by himself Thats amazing! Rumors are that a Third Seat position is being secured for him But why does he dress the same way as the people of the Kuchiki Clan What Dont you know Sir Koga is an accomplished scholar and warrior He married into the Kuchiki Clan Whats wrong You seem dissatisfied Could you tell me Okay Then let me ask you one thing Why did you launch an attack on your own I was confident that with my power, and the power of my Zanpakuto Muramasa, I could change the situation Koga… Do you know what people who have great power need to use their power What would that be Heart Heart Those with power must control their power, but at times, are controlled by their power In order to gain balance, you need a heart that is not overconfident of your power I am well aware of your superior abilities However, you still lack the heart to make full use of those abilities Take note of this incident as a bad example of your actions Do not forget that you now bear the title and responsibility of our clan But… That is all You may leave Excuse me What troubles you, Koga Im not troubled by anything I see some cloudiness in your heart Its just your imagination Dont hide things from me We are one Our trust in each other makes us stronger Am I not using your powers correctly I dont know Your powers have not reached its full potential There is no telling how much power you can produce I see But let me say this We are a Soul Reaper and Zanpakuto that were meant to be together Trust in me as well as yourself Youre right Trusting myself is the way I can maintain order You did it, Sir Koga You were magnificent That is my report on how the rebels were suppressed What is Sir Ginrei thinking! What are you talking about, Koga No matter what my achievements are, he never accepts me In fact, he seems to look down on me Dont worry about it You are strong and beautiful Whats wrong Is it about him He seems to have changed lately Theres no need to worry He is a sensible man And he has far greater power than I He just needs more time to understand things properly Its no good Retreat! We have a report that most of the rebel forces were suppressed after the battle the other day Great work, Sir Koga We are very proud to be able to work with you, Sir Koga You dont need to flatter me Our goal is not to be popular with the public, but to restore order to the Soul Society What was that about I dont know if theyre big shots or what, but I hate how theyre so secretive! Theyre probably jealous of our achievements You want me to help you Thats right I have organized a special task force to deal with the remaining rebel forces I want you to become its leader and do what you can to get the job done I understand Sir Ginrei… Head Captain Yamamoto had appointed me to be the captain of his special task force I see Try not to tarnish our clans name Are you not happy to hear this Your, no, the Kuchiki Clans son-in-law, has been recognized by Head Captain Yamamoto! Be careful not to misinterpret the Head Captains intention Excuse me Koga Kuchiki… It seems hes leading Head Captain Yamamotos special task force We are close to restoring order to the Soul Society If this continues, it will be difficult for our faction to override his position But I hear he has great power There might not be anything we can do No, I have a plan in place Sir Koga! Its over… This battle is finally over! You did it, Sir Koga! What! Why are you…! Koga Kuchiki! Our plan is for you to die in this rebellion! I see… But… Get him! Youre finished! You cannot defeat me with numbers! Mukojochu! Muramasa! W-What… …is that! Th-This is… It doesnt matter! Go! Dont make me laugh W-What! My Zanpakuto… These guys… Who are they! They are manifestations of your Zanpakuto My voice has awakened their desires What! You will be unable to touch us and will die at the hands of your own Zanpakuto It seems everything is settled Yeah Dont move! What is this Whats the meaning of this, Koga Kuchiki Those fallen beside you do not belong to the rebel faction They belong to our Unified Hegemony! Did you attack your own allies in the battle! Of course not They attacked me, so I attacked them back Whats going on Sir Ginrei! Why, Sir Ginrei! Take a look at the situation Koga, who has married into the Kuchiki Clan, has murdered his fellow Soul Reapers! I-Its true Hes a demon! In order to show off his power, he suddenly attacked us Dont tell lies! We were victims of his ambition You bastard! Arrest him! Arrest Koga Kuchiki right away! Wait! Listen to me! What are you going to do, Koga Damn it! Stop, Koga! Dont do anything Stay still for now Sir Ginrei! Why! Just dont do anything Koga… Your punishment has been decided You will be deprived of the position you have held for the past century And as for your Zanpakuto… It has been deemed dangerous and will be neutralized No way! Sir Ginrei! Are you saying that you believe their claims! Do you really think that I killed them out of my own desire! Do you believe that Id think that No Do you understand Your superiors believe that your Zanpakutos power is a problem It is not you they fear They fear Muramasa going berserk What! Its not me but Muramasa! Koga… I told you before Those with power must have a strong heart You were overconfident in your Zanpakutos powers and continued to believe that your choices were correct Sir Genryusai was worried about you going berserk, so he placed you under his direct command I was set up! By those who want power! No Your overconfidence brought about this result Then what should I have done! They were after my life! Are you saying that I should have died! Restrain yourself Theres still time until your punishment is carried out Learn some patience That might be good for you You really have rushed into your death this time But I need to handle the situation quickly Or else he really will lose his powers Why doesnt he understand me! Why doesnt Sir Ginrei understand  my power and my existence! You dont need him to understand you I told you Believe in me…and in yourself Muramasa! How! How have you manifested! Your desires, your inner anger, have reached out to me My desire! If you call to me, I will go to wherever you are I am your Zanpakuto Live And follow your desires! Whos there! Lets go, Koga You dont need to follow the rules of a world that despises and envies your power You should just change the world with your power Let me make one thing clear, Muramasa I am your master As my Zanpakuto, you have no business telling me what to do! Damn it! Hes been awakened! Lets go, Ichigo! Okay! What Spiritual Pressure! Hes been sealed away for so long… And yet he still possesses this much Spiritual Pressure! Youve awakened… Koga… Ive waited for this moment for so long Nows the time for us to complete our goal! Mura…masa… W-Why! In the next episode, you shall witness our perfect team play!

I have news to report Kogas victims now exceed several dozen as of yesterday Because of Kogas unique abilities, selecting even veteran squad members is meaningless because their swords get taken away… There is one way The only way to take on Kogas illusion-type Zanpakuto is to understand his power and close ones heart But in order to block his attack in that state, one must possess considerable Spiritual Pressure and an unyielding mental fortitude Aside from myself, if there is one other person who could, on top of all that, still cross swords with him, we might have a chance… Anyone In that case… I will help you seal Koga away Koga Oh, its you Why did you kill even innocent people in the Rukon District Yeah…thats because… I wanted to send a message to all of the Soul Society A message What for To show the foolishness of ostracizing me from this world, and to show how powerless the Soul Reapers are to stop my power… To do that, you indiscriminately kill defenseless people Is that necessary to create our vision of an ideal new world Our What do you mean our! Whore you kidding! You consider yourself my equal! Koga Youre my sword! A sword should keep quiet and do as its told! Youre exhausted… You should rest… Shut up! Youre a sword— dont give me orders! What brings you two senior citizens here Did you come to kneel down before my power It would seem thats not the reason… Koga… Wasnt your power for the purpose of making your ideal come true Ideal There are no ideals in this world All that exists beyond ideals is the despair of being unable to make them come true But despair releases my true power… Despair is what takes off my binding and frees my heart to do as it wishes Koga…youre mistaken Only those with power create all order… Even if that power is dark black and ugly, if that power wins, black becomes the color of what is right!

Koga… Koga… Why… Why did you do this to me What What in the world is going on Koga You didnt answer me… When I was on the verge  of being sealed away, I called for you… You called…for me You refused to lend me a hand… You say you…called me Your voice did not reach me… Its the truth I waited so long for you to call me… And if I was called, I would have come at any time to assist you with all the power within me… That is how I felt… But for so long, your voice never called… Eventually, I learned that you had been sealed away… Thats why Ive been trying for so long… to undo the seal… Its meaningless if youre not there when I need you! I, a Soul Reaper, gave birth to your power! All you need to do is to do as I say! Werent we of one spirit One spirit To me, youre just a sword… Nothing more than a tool A mere tool shouldnt be so conceited! You call your own Zanpakuto a tool and slay it… You have no right to call yourself a Soul Reaper Muramasas objective was Koga, but Koga stabbed him, and then Byakuya appeared… So…huh Next time, Senbonzakura will explain it so even a monkey would understand You can confirm your facts at that time Just as Id expect from you, Brother! Thank you for being so considerate I think he takes us for fools Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! Byakuya Today, Im going to explain this to you The kenseikan is a headpiece KENSEIKAN that only high-ranking nobles are permitted to wear Youll be wearing it someday, as well Start thinking about how youll wear yours Yes, Grandfather If I might ask, Grandfather What is it Where do you wear your kenseikan, Grandfather Grandfather "
" Zanpakuto… Their shape and abilities are based on their Soul Reapers soul Soul Reapers gain power by learning their names and synergizing with them They are born with Soul Reapers and die with Soul Reapers That is what Zanpakuto are Byakuya… Brother… A silvery-white windflower silk scarf… And a kenseikan… Youre…from the Kuchiki Clan, arent you Byakuya Kuchiki, 28th generation head of the Kuchiki Clan 28th generation head… I see… A great deal of time appears to have passed since I was sealed away So, did Ginrei kick the bucket Dont talk about my Grandfather so familiarly You soiled the honor of the Kuchiki Clan You have no right to speak of my grandfathers name Bastard… Brother… What… …is going on here! I thought you were on their side… Watch quietly This is a fight with the Kuchiki Clans honor at stake What You… Werent you under Muramasas mind control Yes… Its true that at one point, I fell under Muramasas mind control However… Master… Youve returned to your senses, Senbonzakura What happened I dont know… A sudden voice rang within my chest It told me to release my heart and follow as I desired… I see… I thought so Byakuya, having been told by his grandfather, Ginrei, was aware of the Zanpakuto, Muramasa, and its master, Koga Know this If by chance the seal is broken, it will be your duty as head of  the Kuchiki Clan to slay that man The world must never be exposed to that warped evil power ever again I swear on my honor as head of the Kuchiki Clan… Byakuya went to the archives in search of clues to Koga But… as he feared, there was no record All he came away with was the further realization that he could not make the incident public That Soul Reaper named Koga… He was connected with the Kuchiki Clan! But thats no reason for him to keep it all hidden from us as well! It was all for the sake of determining where Koga was sealed away! Merely killing Muramasa is meaningless… The real person who must be defeated is Koga alone! So, I acted as though I had been brainwashed But it wasnt easy to identify the location where Koga had been sealed away Thats why Byakuya stayed by Muramasa… Even if that meant giving his friends the wrong idea… Why did he go through all that Because it is his duty as head of the Kuchiki Clan Brother… Head of the Kuchiki Clan… Are you planning to seal me away, too No, I cant allow you to remain alive any longer You soiled the honor of the Kuchiki Clan… I will kill you Spoken with the true arrogance of the Kuchiki Clan… Fine… If youre the head of the Kuchiki Clan, I have ample reason to fight, as well Koga…use me… My power belongs to you… W-Why You have become nothing but a hindrance to me I dont need to use an unstable sword like you— my powers alone are enough Damn you! What do you take your Zanpakuto for! A Zanpakuto is merely a tool There are any number of replacements Muramasa! Did his despair trigger an inability to control his Spiritual Pressure Ko…ga… What the hell! I dont believe it… He collected Menos inside of him This is a waste of time… Ichigo Kurosaki… Byakuya… You were willing to pretend to betray us to be true to your own pride! In that case, let us take care of this You defeat Koga! Brother! Lets do it, Ichigo! Right! Getsugatensho! Soren Sokatsui! Senbozakura Lets go Yes, Master Whats that supposed to be You mean this Didnt I tell you Any weapon will do Come! Kuchiki Clan head! You do indeed seem to possess the skills to call yourself head of the clan Lets see how you do with Kido! Kongobaku! Hado 33, Sokatsui! Gakirekko! Hado 4, Byakurai! Hyogaseiran! Bakudo 81, Danku Byakuya! Oh Against my Senbonzakura, your Kido is mere childs play Dont get cocky, youngster! Ive captured your image Youre no longer able to move even a single finger! Scatter, Senbonzakura This ends here You left yourself wide open, Kuchiki Clan head Youre not getting away! What have you done Muramasa can control Zanpakuto… That ability came from my powers By sending Spiritual Pressure into my adversary, I am able to confuse his five senses Already, your bodys senses are in the palm of my hand You cant even tell for sure if that is me standing right before your eyes An illusion It isnt anything so simplistic! In your present state, even the distance you see with your eyes and the distance you swing your sword no longer match You can no longer fight effectively Of course… if you had challenged me with your heart closed the way Ginrei and Genryusai did, I wouldnt have been able to use this technique It appears you let your guard down when I snapped Muramasa Youre wrong What I challenged you without closing my heart in order to kill you If I closed my heart, I may have been able to seal you away, but I wouldnt be able to kill you You have the gall to talk like that in your situation… No you dont! What! Hyogaseiran! Danku Which way are you facing Youre a sorry sight Without your Zanpakuto, youre powerless, kid! The enemys skill is irrelevant… Everyone falls to their knees before me! Thats right! Its all because of my power! Even without a Zanpakuto… I am the strongest there is! Lets put an end to this… Kuchiki Clan head of today! What the—! Thats impossible! It did Shikai by itself! Senbonzakura… Master… If your senses have been shut down, I will fight as your eyes and limbs Then Ill control the senses of that sword and you together! I wont allow it Bankai Senkei, Senbonzakura Kageyoshi This is the true form of Senbonzakura It is a specialized form that discards defense for the sole purpose of defeating an enemy Within my space, confused senses mean nothing Wherever you are, this blade will find you without fail Wherever I am, you say That goes for me, as well! Damn you! How is it that you possess so much power It is because we fight together A Soul Reaper and Zanpakuto together make one We display our true powers only when our respective souls are in harmony You, who have abandoned everything for the sake of silly pride, cannot defeat us Shut up! Youre the ones who dont understand anything! Despite all of my achievements, no one recognized what I did They branded me a traitor and tried to put me away! If thats the case, then I decided to create a place for myself! Power is order! Im going to become king of a new world! Such foolishness… What! The real tragedy is that you failed to recognize the true nature of power The power you needed… was the power to relate with others and with your Zanpakuto Relate with I dont need that kind of power! My power is like no other! Absolute power that has no equal! Then I wont say any more… You can blame your own immaturity for not being able to recognize your confidence as arrogance Koga… l will now complete the duty I inherited from my grandfather, Ginrei, as head of the Kuchiki Clan Senbonzakura Kageyoshi… Shukei Hakuteiken Youre more than I expected Even among the long line of Kuchiki Clan heads, few are as powerful as you You were once a member of the Kuchiki Clan By using this technique, I pay my final respects Then I will defeat you and blow away my Kuchiki Clan curse once and for all! I was strict with Koga, but that backfired I let Byakuya have his way, but he grew up obstinate Raising children is difficult The World of the Living has lots of how-to books Dont give my grandfather any ideas! Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! Zanpakuto manifestation… Sado! There is no need for you to worry! Im sure you can talk with yours too! Take me, for example! Oh, Uryu! Because you listened to me, Im able to speak like this! You see Uryu, you have another weapon, dont you He wants to talk to you, too You dont mean… Seeleschneider No way "
" Zanpakuto… Their shape and abilities are based on their Soul Reapers soul Soul Reapers gain power by learning their names and synergizing with them They are born with Soul Reapers and die with Soul Reapers That is what Zanpakuto are What the hell happened to Muramasa! My body…hot… Settle down! Koga… Koga… Koga… Koga! Getsugatensho! Whyre Hollows coming out of Muramasas body! Its likely that hes no longer able to suppress the Spiritual Pressure of the Hollows, that he had somehow absorbed… He gave up everything for Kogas sake… He even exceeded his own limitations— its as though hes only existed until now through sheer will power… Ko…ga… Whats that! Theyre… This is bad! It looks like Muramasas Spiritual Pressure is attracting Hollows in the vicinity! Then Ill take them on all at once! Damn! Huh Ishida! Against these numbers, it looks like my bow is more appropriate than your sword thats huge but nothing more Youre so nice to have around— like bug spray Shut up! Kurosaki! Kuchiki! Chad! Inoue! Santenkesshun! Nice, Inoue Damn… Whats going to happen to Muramasa! This…cant be… Not yet… I still have… Come to me…Muramasa… Whats the matter Muramasa… Why wont you respond Im calling for you! Mura…ma… Im all right now Koga… If he hadnt possessed such power, he would not have had such delusions… It was the fate of a weak-hearted man consumed and controlled by power… He was the exact opposite of you, who willingly allowed himself to be branded a traitor, in order to stick to your beliefs Now you can finally return to where you belong You talk too much, Senbonzakura What is that! Are the Hollows being sucked toward him Is that…Muramasa! It looks almost like an Arrancar! A Zanpakuto is of one mind and one body with its Soul Reaper master… It attaches itself to the soul of its master and coexists with him… Are you saying that in order to maintain his physical form, he needed a source of energy to replace his Soul Reaper master He probably had to take in Hollows in order to maintain his body… Then the energy that deflected my power was… It goes to show how deep his feeling and obsession towards Koga was But for it to end in such a way… W-Why You have become nothing but a hindrance to me I dont need to use an unstable sword like you— my powers alone are enough A Zanpakuto is merely a tool Damn… If we dont do something, his Spiritual Pressure might envelop all of Karakura Town… We have to stop him before that happens! Right! Hes coming! Hes fast! Those eyes… It looks so lonely… He so desperately sought after his master, only to be abandoned… Its too cruel Brother! Youre all right Byakuya! Did you defeat Koga Did you think I would lose Yeah, right You look pretty beat up Brother, we need to treat your injuries… Never mind that… Right now, he is our main concern… I never expected him to unleash a Sero… Hes completely become a Hollow… I wont give in… Not to the power of Hollows… I wont give in… What Is he… fighting the Hollows he absorbed This is all wrong… Inoue! Stop! Dont fight anymore! The person you were looking for no longer exists! Its no use, Inoue! The way he is now, he cant listen to reason… No… He hasnt completely been possessed by Hollows yet… In the depths of despair, hes still fighting desperately to maintain his identity… What! I wont give in… I wont…give in… Koga… Is he still seeking Koga, even though hes become like that What tenacity… Its meaningless to do this… Youll only cause yourself more suffering… So…lets stop this I wont give in…I wont…give… Inoue, get away from him! Why you—! Are you okay, Inoue Yes…its nothing Cant we save him from his sadness Getsugatensho! Huh Stop it! Damn! The Hollows are swarming again! Sado, well split up and take care of them! El Directo! Hado 33, Sokatsui! Scatter, Senbonzakura Muramasa! Getsugatensho! I wont…give…in… What the—! Kurosaki! Ichigo! No… Kurosakis Spiritual Pressure is… It cant be… What is this The Spiritual Pressure of the Hollows that Muramasa took in induced this… Inoue I have to go and save Kurosaki and Muramasa… Its dangerous!

Thats actually… Captain Komamura The Arrancar Encyclopedia Thats odd… Whats the matter You look like theres a problem… There is a sudden decrease in the number of Menos recently Huh Could someone be poaching Menos Hold on a second, Tosen… Dont tell me you were also managing the Menos Why of course Checking their health condition, knowing what foods theyre eating… Keeping watch over each individual is the way to raise the best Menos So where exactly are you going to sell them off to "

Growl! – Roar! – Roar! Extend! Tear in Frenzy! Hey you! Whats the idea of going ahead of your master! Whatre you talking about Right now, master shmaster, it doesnt matter! How I hate this Do you realize how ugly it is to rush to get the credit You dont seem to get that being jealous of getting beaten to the punch is far more ugly… Theyre coming! Yeah Somenomai, Tsukishiro! Its a Cero! Good grief… Cant let those hot-blooded Zanpakuto do the job alone… Thanks for helping us Helping you I had no such intention Im just taking care of what needs to be done Shunko! Ishida! Whatre you doing, Ishida! You! What will you do if your careless attacks damage the town! And Kurosakis still inside there… Not my concern My mission is to get rid of that thing I wont let you interfere Captain Soi Fon! Stop it! This is no time for that Our priority is the Hollows that surround us All right, fine Captain Hitsugaya… You people check for Ichigo Kurosakis Spiritual Pressure to find out how he is doing inside there Thank you very much, Captain Hitsugaya But our enemys numbers are so great… Even if we faced them together with our Zanpakuto, theyre still going to be difficult to handle… At this very moment, Captain Kurotsuchi continues to release the remaining Zanpakuto from the mind control, but theres not enough time to wait for them to rendezvous with us… Let me confirm with you We will take care of all of the ones here Is that okay with you Of course I have your back Mind your own business… Roar! Monkey… Werent those two… Yeah…they had us completely fooled… Cut it out Were in the middle of a battle But you know…I get it… I know how Hozukimaru feels He even put on a hokey act by claiming he wouldnt accept Soul Reapers… Whatever the reason, it doesnt sit right This is no time to be talking about that! But… You can sort out your feelings later, at your leisure More importantly, right now, we have a mission as Zanpakuto Yes, I understand Lets do our best, everyone! Did your personality change after the mind control was undone You think so At any rate, I dont like it! Enough! She cant help it Its not just the Zanpakuto that feel that way Rangiku… Although we are members of the same Thirteen Court Guard Squads, we have no intention of being bound by the mission… Its none of my business how you people feel, but its also my right to think what I want Are you okay, Captain Surely youre not going to say youve reached your limit with only injuries like those, are you Karakura Town has been placed in an Area Freeze Were now free to use full power What do you mean full power If you get carried away and commit a blunder, were not cleaning up after you! You dont want someone with a big butt cleaning up after you, right, Renji Whyre you such a dummy like your master! Cant help it! Because, in fact, he is a dummy! Hey! Cut that out, you guys! But…let me say this, Captain… Im sure there are people who want to give you a  piece of their mind… But Captain, I…I… Renji Lets go Thats what you get for trying to play it cool… You suck! Shut up! Come on, lets go! Lets do this, Omaeda Right! Ill show those guys that theyre no match for me! Smashem! Gegetsuburi! Damn it you! Whatd you do that for! Dont tell me you havent been released from Muramasas mind control! Its not that! Then whats the big idea! Kicking your beloved master in the back like that! Address me as Mister Huh Say, Smashem, Mister Gegetsuburi! What What Soul Reaper addresses his own Zanpakuto with Mister – when doing a Shikai! – Uh, excuse me… You can do it! Make history! – Dont talk nonsense! – This is hopeless Its because you were being so annoying! Thats because you wont address me with Mister! Raise your head… Captain Komamura… Wow… That grazed me a bit… Maybe I took too much rest… My body seems a bit slow Keep wasting your time, and Ill take care of everything by myself Thats fine with me, but the least you can do is to keep  from getting caught in my power Yes, Sir… Were sorry I think I dribbled… Its no use… I cant sense Ichigos Spiritual Pressure… Kurosaki… Theres no sense just waiting like this We need to take measures fast Wait, Ishida! Whats with that! Muramasas Spiritual Pressure is out of control Even with a captains Bankai, it wont be easy to defeat him But unless we do something… What was that Thats… No way! Are more of them still coming out! Is this for real Were not going to have to face all of them, as well, are we Looks like we are Man, this makes so much extra work… Captain Komamura… Looks like this is no time to be arguing, eh Guess we have no choice Times like this are the only time you two get along, it seems… We wont get anywhere like this… The Spiritual Pressure of the sphere has increased even further… Its inducing the fissure to expand and attracting Menos At this rate, infinite flow of Menos will come this way Therell be no end!

You should no longer have any reason to fight! You dont get it! Your power will nourish me That being the case, I will not give up the fight Thats all there is! I wont fall for that! Youre not using that attack on me! Ive seen through your move! What! Its useless Flailing your sword around wont allow you to escape my power Dammit… Why Looks like its over for you What happened! It suddenly loosened… Getsugatensho! I figured it out! It isnt that your technique is invisible By reflecting your technique in a mirror or on water, you make your enemy think there is an invisible power there But… It seems the real power is in the reflected image In that case… If it doesnt reflect on the waters surface, you cant use your technique! Youre mine! Indeed, I cant seem to utilize my power to its fullest extent right here But that is not the only ability I possess From the moment you and I faced each other, you were caught in my technique Damn… How do I beat this guy Ichigo… Feel it… Zangetsu! His power of suggestion does not work on me I will become your eyes But it is impossible for this to work without you and I— Zanpakuto and Master— are truly connected to one another I got it, old man Youre coming at me again Here we go How is he! Getsuga… …tensho! Thats right… You have Zangetsu by your side… I understand now what the old man was saying… What! Recognizing and accepting each others existence Thats how the relationship between Zanpakuto and Soul Reapers should be You must know that, too What would you know! Isnt it about time you get it, already! Ichigo… Were at the limit There is a maelstrom here of deep-seated grudges belonging to the Hollows that he kept consuming for many years They are about to crush him at any time now We dont have time, Ichigo Yeah His voice never reached me… Muramasa! Ichigo, get out of here… If you remain here, youll never be able to go back… Muramasa… why must you go this far to… Its none of your business! He said he didnt need you… So why Kogas abilities are worthy of ruling the Soul Society… I was proud of that He possesses that much ability! I can still fight! So what! Didnt you say you were going to free the Zanpakuto! So now you bring that up That was bullshit to trick you! Is that really true! You even said you killed your master! Wasnt the truth that your master wasnt paying any attention to you! You realized that, but still continued to exist for the purpose of undoing Kogas seal Wasnt that because you wanted to communicate with Koga more than anyone! It was a pipe dream… It wouldnt have lasted long… Hey! Ichigo… We wont be able to make it in time If he becomes a Hollow, pockets of reishi in the World of  the Living would become unbalanced, and Karakura Town could be destroyed He wont become a Hollow… Muramasa… I intend to be together with  my Zanpakuto, Zangetsu, to the very end Not only me! My friends, and even the captains, as well… To a Soul Reaper and Zanpakuto, each is irreplaceable and special to the other! You knew that better than anyone Why have you been doing things that trampled on that pride! You have no right to tell me that! That is the true nature of my power! Holding someone down by force isnt the only way to use a Zanpakuto Theres no need to accommodate everything a Soul Reaper does! Looks like my time is up Ichigo… Yeah… Here I go! Hyorinmaru! Captain! That was the last one! Yeah… Whats going on What! Muramasa… Muramasa! Muramasa! How ironic… Its your voice that reaches my soul What happened I dont know the reason, but the Hollows Spiritual Pressure is gone Then Karakura Town is saved Kurosaki! What Thats definitely Kurosakis Spiritual Pressure! Is this what you call a sharing of the soul Yes… I wound up making quite a mess of Koga didnt I It happens to all of us If you made a mistake, just fix it Im sure… someday… Ichigo… Is everyone all right Theyre all safe Is Muramasa gone He kept his pride as a Zanpakuto until the very end Brother… Byakuya… Rain Whats this It feels strange, somehow… I want to go back Youre back Welcome back… Were going back Huh Huh Captain… Yeah… They sure put us through a lot of trouble… Ichigo Kurosaki… This is the second time Im thanking you Thank you for your help Sure… Uh-oh, Id better get back to Las Noches quickly!

Youre not going Im fine Besides, thisll be a good chance for everyone to get to know the captain But they look all tense and nervous around him Still, I never thought that the captain would let us use his mansion for flower watching The battle with the Zanpakuto has left everyone worn out This is my brothers way of helping everyone to relax You should be grateful! Yeah, yeah… Come to think of it, wasnt this place blown to bits By your Zanpakuto, that is! I mean Squad Six hasnt even begun making repairs! The Kuchiki Clan has money and connections… – And with their secret techniques, – Lieutenant! Please come join us! – repairing this place is easy – Everyones too nervous to talk! Come on you guys… You cant even talk to the captain without my help Renji wasnt listening to me at all! Unbelievable! Stop that! Who are you guys! Stand down! Oh no! Damn it… Dance… Tsuginomai… Hakuren! Youre not getting away! Youre… Sodenoshirayuki! I told you, youre not getting away! Somenomai… Are you all right, Sodenoshirayuki Im fine, Sir Senbonzakura Are you all right, Lady Rukia Y-Y-Y-Y-You guys! I thought you returned to being swords What are you talking about What I do not recall making such a statement Thats true, but… Dont blame us for making the wrong assumption What! Whats all the fuss about How What This is most unusual I never expected you to visit me Umm… As you can see, our Zanpakuto are still manifested Of course they are! Huh I undid their brainwashing, but I never said I turned them back to normal Here! Take a look! Thats the situation Dont bother asking me such questions when Im so busy! Nemu! Back to work Yes, Master Mayuri Wait, Captain Kurotsuchi! What is it Im busy Please answer one more question One more Its about this Zanpakuto Oh, that Thats the result of a Zanpakuto going out of control after Muramasa manifested it A Zanpakuto going out of control! You know that Muramasas ability affected not only captains, but also regular squad members, right Some of them were unable to defeat their Zanpakuto and died This Zanpakuto is one of those who went out of control, as a result of losing its master I didnt know… Usually when a Zanpakutos owner dies, the Zanpakuto disappears as well But something abnormal must have taken place They are no longer Zanpakuto or Soul Reapers or even Hollows You could say they are mutants I know… I think I shall name them Sword Beasts And why did that sword suddenly lose its manifested appearance We dont know It no longer has any spiritual pressure One of them escaped, right Capture it and I may be able to answer your question! Oh… One more thing… The power of a sword beast is equal to that of a Zanpakutos true power— in other words, its Bankai Even if they belonged to lower-ranking Soul Reapers, their power is probably far greater than you think Well, try not to get killed by them Zanpakuto that have lost their owners and have gone out of control… This is quite troublesome, isnt it, Big Brother Those fiends caused massive damage to the Kuchiki Manor! Their actions cannot be forgiven! Thats right! You two were the ones who destroyed most of the mansion! The question is, how do we capture Zanpakuto that escaped Oh! There you are! Captain! Its almost time to take over the next Seireitei guard duties Is it Rukia… For now, Im going to leave you in charge of handling this case Yes, sir! Ill leave Senbonzakura with you Use him however you like Are you sure about that Absolutely I have a suggestion Perhaps we could destroy one of the barracks to get the attention of everyone in Seireitei That might surprise the fiend and get him to come out Were trying to rebuild at the moment! We cant cause more destruction! Then how about we freeze the entire town along with the fiend The town itself will remain unharmed Out of the question, you fool! Why must you two come up with such drastic solutions! Think of the trouble youll cause around you! Is it a problem Cant do this, Cant do that, I have no idea what you want us to do Thats what Id like to say! In that case, how about we do this Thank you everyone, for your hard work! Cheers! – Cheers! – Cheers! You two can really down those drinks Oh, you bet! But I never thought a day would come where wed actually get orders to throw a party… Im so happy! It really is awesome! Hey, you! Why are you manifesting again! I do as I please! – Well dont come out! – Now, now, it doesnt matter – which form shes in – Just keep on drinking, okay Just keep on drinking, okay Oh! Bring more drinks over here! What is this Oh! Well… Umm… Its a party! I can see that I got an order to let you use this area But Im asking you why this is necessary Its to capture a Zanpakuto that has gone out of control, sir We believe it likes parties What The fiend crashed a flower viewing party that was held by the Kuchiki Clan So were throwing another party! Youre basing it just on that Is that unsatisfactory, sir Are you being serious The fiend isnt showing up Thats odd Thats odd… Not! Could it be that we didnt party hard enough We partied more than enough! I hope your reason for suggesting this wasnt so that you could have fun! By the way, I dont see Sir Senbonzakura Senbonzakura is passed out over there – Huh – Huh – Oh, dont be so heartless… – Your mask is coming off! What! What are you doing! Kuchiki… Dont you think this is enough Captain Hitsugaya… Im sorry for all the trouble we caused Dont worry about it Ever since the Muramasa incident, my squad members havent had time to relax Its a good breather for them Captain… Lets drink some more… Shut up! Im leaving! What Youre no fun Youre no fun! Kuchiki… Take care of putting out the fire Yes, understood, sir! Oh, Captain! Wait for me! Im very sorry It seems this plan wasnt very good Dont worry about it You did the best you could We were just unlucky this time around Lady Rukia… Its kind of nice to talk to you like this once in a while Whats wrong We Zanpakuto are nothing but weapons meant for fighting Perhaps we do lack heart Sodenoshirayuki… I prided myself on my power Which is why I wanted to act on my own just once Thats how Muramasa was able to worm his way into my heart I thought that I could do anything by myself But this incident made me realize that I was mistaken As a weapon, I have nothing Without your heart, Im just a tool of destruction Youre wrong! Youre absolutely wrong! You and I were always together You watched over me through difficult and painful times Your existence has saved me so many times I was able to stay strong because of you So dont say that youre nothing Lady Rukia… This spiritual pressure! Lets go! Yes, maam! Lets capture him! Yes, maam! Stop! Thats enough! Lady Rukia! I wont let you do that! If I dont distance myself, Ill be at a disadvantage… Hado 33! Sokatsui! Lady Rukia! Ill back you up! Okay! Sokatsui! Somenomai! Tsukishiro! Lady Rukia… Lady Rukia! Sodenoshirayuki… I understand Lets go Yes, maam! Tsuginomai… Hakuren! One, two, three, go! So what did you do with the Zanpakuto you captured I sent it to the Department of Research and Development Thats probably the right thing to do Captain Ukitake… About that sword beast… Yes… That probably wont be the last time we see one Ive received several reports of such incidents I thought so And the Zanpakuto have manifested again I guess that means we still havent solved this case And of all times… Weve got to rebuild Seireitei as quickly as possible… This is problematic Take that! Cut it out, you two! Be a little more quiet! Okay! Itll be all right We will do what we can to help Thats right Im counting on you, Sodenoshirayuki Yes, maam! Why were the cherry blossoms in full bloom at this time of year Theres nothing strange about it Do you know something about that, Sodenoshirayuki I do Isnt that right, Sir Senbonzakura Thats right No wonder there were so many injured people afterwards… THE ARRANCRA ENCYCLOPEDIA The Arrancar Encyclopedia! Today, well be talking about a new enemy—the Sword Beasts Sword Beasts are Zanpakuto that have gone out of control after their owners have died Sword Beast is written with the characters for sword and beast Why are you the one explaining this! I accidentally came in thinking I would have screen time beginning with todays episode Can you at least let me do this part Didnt Ulquiorra tell you anything Ulquiorra - > Yammy -> Wonderweiss -> Stark -> Barragan -> GIN It seems that some wrong information got mixed in along the way Is this a game of telephone "
" Zanpakuto… Their shape and abilities are based on their Soul Reapers soul Soul Reapers gain power by learning their names and synergizing with them They are born with Soul Reapers and die with Soul Reapers That is what Zanpakuto are Thats the result of a Zanpakuto going out of control after Muramasa manifested it You know that Muramasas ability affected not only captains, but also regular squad members, right Some of them were unable to defeat their Zanpakuto and died This Zanpakuto is one of those who went out of control as a result of losing its master I know… I think I shall name them Sword Beasts Did you hear something crash I didnt hear anything Everything looks normal I guess I was just imagining things Whats wrong, Ichigo! Did you sense something that cannot be seen I see… Maybe I did! I know nothing! I cant see anything that cant be seen! Youre not making any sense I dont know anything! I know absolutely nothing! See you later! Whats wrong with him I knew Id find someone here Have you come after me Who are you It doesnt seem like youre a Soul Reaper or a Hollow… My master… Where is my master Master You mean, youre Hes a Zanpakuto! Wait! He got away A Zanpakuto Whats going on I thought we settled the whole Muramasa incident Thats what I came here to tell you I hear things were very rough this time around So hows the Soul Society now Has it recovered Well, you see… I hear Muramasa was betrayed by his master The poor thing Still, he did immense damage to the Soul Society Hes not one to be pitied Sword Beasts Theyre Zanpakuto that have lost their masters I feel sorry for them, but we cannot let them roam free And, as I suspected, some have already wandered into this world How dangerous Thats the situation, Kurosaki And what is that supposed to mean Hey, who the hell are you It doesnt matter who I am! Ive got no business with stuffed animals! What did you say! Okay, okay! Dont fight, you two! Matsumoto… Oh, there he is! Theres Captain Hitsugaya! Captain You guys… I never told you to come with me Dont make such a scary face Haineko wanted to take a peek at the World of the Living Were not here to have fun! Here! Check these out! WE TWO GET ALONG SO WELL! RANGIKU & HAINEKO BEAUTY QUEENS HAVE ARRIVED IN KARAKURA TOWN! GROWL! Well, well… Hey! Who is this woman! Shes Haineko, my Zanpakuto Be kind to her, okay No way! Well, well … Come on take a look, Ichigo! No way! Come on… Its only natural for a young man like you to want to take a look You dont have to hold back Come on, come on, come on You guys… Cut it out! So about these Sword Beasts… I wonder how many Zanpakuto have lost their owners Well… At the very least, theres probably as many as the squad members who died in battle Hmm… Thats quite a lot Not only that, but our Zanpakuto, which we thought had turned back into swords, are wandering about again So it seems Well, Im fine with that However… The Sword Beasts no longer have a place to return to We cannot ignore them if they lose control any further and do evil deeds I win Oh, my Youre right I lost again Now for your penalty Okay, okay… Here! Draw for us! CRAYON Oh… Okay, okay… Draw some more! Like this More! So… Yes, Im fine with this and all… Yeah Definitely Im fine with it too… But I still think its more natural for a Zanpakuto to remain inside its sword I think so too Owowowowow… Owowowowow… Hey, that hurts! An unexpected parting gift indeed… This is an odd feeling What is Ive always been with you, even before you manifested, but its an odd feeling walking with you side by side It is, isnt it There was a time when I thought this day would never come… When was that When I saw you break and lose your spiritual pressure I was petrified Im sorry for making you worry It was all thanks to Captain Kurotsuchis hard work that I am here now Captain Kurotsuchi, huh Lets begin Yes, sir Captain, it appears to be interfering with some other wave It seems my hunch was correct She regenerated To be honest, I had my doubts about his crazy experiments But he saved you, so I guess I should be thankful to Captain Kurotsuchi I suppose so Master… I must find him quickly… A Hollow… It was a Sword Beast Yeah But it instantly disappeared Whats going on Shall I call Haineko and the others No, lets not Theyd just make things more complicated Wow! Youre so cute! Y-You think so Well, the portable gigai is working out well, and Orihimes clothes seem to fit perfectly All thats left… This looks cooler! Oh, I kind of like it! Right! Say, Rangiku… What How were the Zanpakuto able to turn back to normal Oh… Well, you see… When a Soul Reaper calls out the name of his Zanpakuto, it allows the Zanpakuto and the Soul Reaper to synchronize and fight together Captain Kurotsuchi tested out many different ways to return the Zanpakuto back to normal by making use of that property I see… The rest was easy The keywords were synchronization and interference All of the brainwashed Zanpakuto were unstable In short, I just had to stabilize them You probably wouldnt understand my explanation, though Stabilize Thats right Muramasa destabilized our existence That magnified the small anxieties we had and caused us to lose control of ourselves Hmm… So thats what happened… Whats so funny Nothing, sir Then… Can we bring the Sword Beasts under control using the same method We need Captain Kurotsuchi to do all he can Sorry, Nanao, but could you go to the Department of Research and Development one more time for me Understood, sir Dont forget to take some sweets So you want me to do something about this mess Yes Easy for you to say Can you do it It doesnt really interest me Interest I was the one who released the Zanpakuto from their mind control Yes, you were Thinking of a way to tame Zanpakuto that have lost their masters and become Sword Beasts is not very interesting But the current situation requires a… Leave What! No Umm… Im sorry My captain isnt feeling well Nemu, prepare some tea Right away, sir Hmm… I guess I have no choice This thing… The relationship shared between Soul Reapers and Zanpakuto… Yes In that sense, what led to Muramasas madness could have happened to any other Zanpakuto We now know that such danger also exists I see BEAUTIFUL SKIN BIG EYES SMALL FACE You really know all the new spots, Orihime I never knew that there was a photo booth like this! The World of the Living really is amazing! It changes every time I come So, you two want to go to the new fast fashion shop next – You bet! – You bet! Whats wrong, Rangiku Well… Its about the Spiritual Pressure of a Sword Beast… Wait, you were actually searching for it Ive been tracking its presence all this time I may not look it, but I am a lieutenant! However… However Its Spiritual Pressure changed Huh Why Who knows We still dont know much about Sword Beasts The only thing we do know is that Sword Beasts are Zanpakuto that have gone out of control So Im going to capture it As a Zanpakuto, what do you think Well… I was able to return to normal like this because you, my master, was safe But the Sword Beasts… They have lost their place to return to Were the same Zanpakuto, and yet… Whether a Zanpakuto lives or dies all depends on its master… Rain… Lets go! Its close! What A Sword Beast! Its definitely the Spiritual Pressure of a Sword Beast But something is What is that This one… Is it a Hollow Stand back! Are you all right Yeah, Im fine What the heck Thats a Hollow! Oh no In this form… Leave it to me! Haineko! Ill fight! Haineko! Where Where is he Give me back my master! What are you blabbering about, Hollow Where is my master! Who is this guy Ichigo! Kurosaki! Rangiku! Take care of her Theres no escape Lets end this here Ichigo… This is the Zanpakuto from earlier What My master… Where is my master! But it looks completely different It appears it has fused with a Hollow Youre right Ive never seen a Hollow use a sword before Sorry… Here I go Getsuga… What power… Damn it! Reign over the Frosted Heavens! Hyorinmaru! Toshiro! Thats what I thought… Yeah, it was stronger than I expected I figured their Spiritual Pressure would increase if they fused with another Spiritual Entity… But it seems like theyre going to be trouble Be careful Yes, sir Im going to turn in my report on this incident Were going back to the Soul Society Hey, where did everyone go Raingiku and the other went off to continue shopping Hyorinmaru isnt here, either They took him along to carry their things Hyorinmaru! Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! I want to see what he looks like under that mask Yeah MENS BATH This place is perfect! I cant believe were waiting here to take a look at a man Well, if we want a peek… Oh! There he is! What do you want Why dont you take off your mask! "

" Zanpakuto… Their shape and abilities are based on their Soul Reapers soul Soul Reapers gain power by learning their names and synergizing with them They are born with Soul Reapers and die with Soul Reapers That is what Zanpakuto are How about some tea, Lieutenant Ise Have I been working that long Im sorry for using your desk… I dont mind These temporary headquarters feel like camp to me… I know its a bit foolish, but Im sort of enjoying it… I know… Oh! Lieutenant Hinamori brought in some cookies she baked herself Cookies baked by Hinamori Is something wrong No… I just remembered an unpleasant memory… Oh! But theyre just regular cookies See Thank goodness Ill make some tea Thats odd… Is something the matter I cant find the tea leaves That is odd I just bought some the other day Recently, a lot of things have been turning up missing Like rice, or soybean paste… Now that you mention it, my captain was saying how his secret stash of sake disappeared Hanamaru… My Hanamaru is… This is the clearest image caught by the surveillance camera Its hard to tell what it is… According to the images, the intruder snuck into the barracks and stole four chickens: Hanamaru, Hanae, Hanakichi and Hanaemon Chickens Ever since the Muramasa Incident, Squad 4 has been so busy that the members barely have time to go home So theyve tried to become  more self-sufficient by raising chickens and growing a vegetable garden at their barracks Their tomatoes and eggs are delicious… I was in charge of raising the chickens… They were all fine yesterday… The fence around the coop wasnt ripped and there werent any holes If were to assume the culprit stole the chickens by opening the entrance door, then it cannot be the work of a simple-minded animal Could it be connected with the rash  of recent thefts at the barracks You dont think the Sword Beasts are responsible, do you What do you think, Captain Unohana I cant eliminate the possibility, but we lack enough information to be sure I traced the footsteps, and confirmed that the alleged culprit escaped via the underground waterway Id like you to identify the thief who escaped via the underground waterway and take him into custody So, why was I summoned here Theres a possibility that the thief may be a Sword Beast So just to be safe Were counting on you Well, it will be a good way to pass the time I guess Sorry to make you do this, Nanao, but Im counting on you! I, Nanao Ise, and my three-man team will get on it immediately! Were counting on you! Catch the thief! Bring back my snacks! We believe in you! Hows it looking See for yourself Is this their present position Yes But I must say, conducting a search and  mapping the underground  waterway is certainly ambitious Why waste the opportunity— its killing two birds with one stone Will they be okay Im sure theyll be fine This place sure has some ambience… Yes, it does There are a lot of scary stories about this place… Oh What sort of stories Well, stories such as  how people have died, gone missing, or have been trapped underground while they were working on extending the waterway They say you can still hear their eerie voices Thats a good one! Maybe our thief is one of them! Ridiculous! Thats just a common ghost story! In the first place, there are no such things as ghosts in the Soul Society… Whats wrong! Something touched my neck! Was it an enemy Uh…if I may… That…was a water drop… Huh See Up there Water is dripping from the spaces between the stones Spooked by a water droplet… Youre quite a scaredy-cat, arent you, Lieutenant Ise W-What was that! What was that just now Its a trap! A booby trap! Yeah… It would appear were unwelcome guests The enemy might be hiding nearby From here on out, lets proceed with caution What is it Look! That spot, where the color is different…is a trap It might be a hole, or maybe a land mine… But putting it smack in the middle of the path is pretty amateur… DO NOT CROSS I get it! We just have to walk along the edge! Wait! Wait! Wait! No! Nothings happening… I was sure I was going to go boom… You imbecile! Dont be so careless, you fool! Im sorry… Thank goodness it didnt go off, but seriously! Be quiet! What is it Cant you hear that Hear what The sound of water There arent any leaks here Its different! Its a lot bigger… More like rushing water… Run! What the hell is going on! Its a time-delay trap! It tricks you into thinking nothing happened, taking away your chance to escape! You fool! This is no time for a leisurely explanation! Everyone all right! Just barely… Damn! What is this place! I dont know… It seems like we were swept quite a distance… I thought you knew a lot about this place! Yes, but I dont know because Ive never come this far Oh, boy Things are starting to look pretty bad Look, how can you be so nonchalant Useless brat as usual Ikkaku! Ikkaku! Third Seat Madarame! Not now, Ikkaku… Youre taking the joke too far… Right, Lieutenant Ise Ikkaku! Hold on! Ill save you! Stay away! Ill figure something out! Dont worry about me and get out of here! Ikkaku! Ikkaku! Third Seat Madarame! What was that thing More importantly… Ikkaku sacrificed himself to save us… Theres no need to worry! A Zanpakuto and its master are of two separate bodies, but share one heart Hes not dead I can tell Hozukimaru… Do you smell something Huh Huh What is that smell What is this No, it cant be… No…are these… Could these grilled chicken skewers be Huh This sake… This belongs to my captain! See, it has his name on it… Then these are all the items that the thief stole from the barracks It would seem so Hey! Stop! Youre not getting away Hanataro! Seventh Seat Yamada! Hes the thief! Please catch him! Huh! Huh…huh But… Im so sorry! Why are you apologizing all of a sudden Anyways, lift your head and show us your face Youre! You know him No, not at all… Dont confuse us with your reactions Im sorry… But theres something awfully familiar about him… Hey! Whatd you do with Ikkaku Im sorry… Who are you, and whyre you here Im sorry! Cant you say anything other than Im sorry! Im sorry! Look…its about time you came clean with us! Ikkaku! Huh! What! So youve come, you monster! Thats a huge Sword Beast! So you were responsible, after all! Im sorry! Nanao Ise, protect them! Right! Ikkaku, Ill get revenge for you! Bankai! Ryumon Hozukimaru! It slipped Damn! Dammit! Let go of me, monster! Hado 31, Shakkaho! Ah! Hozukimaru is! Seventh Seat Yamada! You must fight too! What Youre a Soul Reaper, cant you at least attack with your Zanpakuto But…my Zanpakuto is mainly used for healing, and… And what I thought I wouldnt need it for this search so… I left it back at the barracks in my room… What! Lieutenant Ise! What…should I do… What should I do What should I do! What are you doing! If you do that, Ikkaku will! I dont know why but I feel great! That Zanpakuto is! Fill up! Vermillion Hisagomaru! So from what I understand, the thief was… the manifested form of Seventh Seat Yamadas Zanpakuto, is that correct Yes, sir Why didnt you say so at that time! Well…I didnt realize it at all But what a fitting story for you, Seventh Seat Yamada As Hisagomaru tells it, he also manifested because of Muramasa However, he had no complaints against his master and immediately tried to return to sword form, but was, of course, unable to do so… He thought his master had rejected him And in his dejection, he went to live like a hermit in the underground waterway What! You mean the reason Im not able to return to my original form isnt because my master hates me Thats right… As you can see, were unable to return to our previous form So thats what it was Well, thats such a relief, so my body went limp And what about the grilled chicken skewers What! I would never eat a live chicken! Then where did those grilled chicken skewers come from Those were already prepared dishes from the kitchen! See, theyre here Ah! Hanamaru! Hanae! Hanakichi! And Hanaemon, too! Then whyd you take the chickens The reason is… I made up my mind to live alone… But I was still lonely, so… Hisagomaru! Its all right Youre not alone You have me, Im your partner! Master… Hisagomaru! – Master! – Hisagomaru! Just a minute Theres one thing I want to know… Where is Hisagomaru The one whos at the center of all of this Uh…well…you see… We got separated on our way back Where did everybody go Captain Unohana, my Itegumo has manifested itself as well I know that Itegumo is right here! I see it But were watching scenes from the next episode, right Let it go, Isane Even Hisagomaru got to have screen time, so why only me Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! Im home! Is that you, Ichigo! Whats the matter, Yuzu There were sounds coming from your room, so I though you were already home You dont think… its a burglar! They wouldnt! Ichigo You stay down here!

" Zanpakuto… Their shape and abilities are based on their Soul Reapers soul Soul Reapers gain power by learning their names and synergizing with them They are born with Soul Reapers and die with Soul Reapers That is what Zanpakuto are So running away is all thats left for you! You disappear from my range of vision to attack with projectile weapons… Youre as rotten as you look! Rotten What of it Does it have anything to do with life and death Its not compatible with my way of fighting Like I care I am a Zanpakuto whose sole aim is to take lives I have no interest in how my master fights I always thought that the relationship between a Zanpakuto and a Soul Reaper was one of communication and synergy I dont know about other Zanpakuto! Im me I cut down lives! I thought that was our sole agreement between you and me I see Then its easy If you die and my Zanpakuto disappears, so be it I dont like you I just realized that Fine with me Because the feeling is mutual You say the Sword Beasts are attacking Rukon District Yeah… Seems like theyve teamed up and are going on a rampage I hope the damage doesnt get any worse than it already is… Lets hurry! What is that! Speak of the devil… Must be a Sword Beast! No… Thats not what it is… Thats… Hisagi… – Isnt that your Zanpakuto – Go on ahead Im the one hes after… Hey! Lets go on ahead Hey! Not bad A surprise attack again You dont give up, do you Thats right Im sorry, but Ill do whatever it takes Until we settle our fight, I will pursue you to the ends of the earth Reap, Kazeshini Whats going on, Kira Wasnt that Hisagis Zanpakuto, Kazeshini Did it join the Sword Beasts No, thats not what happened… Hisagis Zanpakuto… Kazeshini, is unlike the other Zanpakuto It seems it continues to act independently even after the Muramasa incident was resolved Kazeshini is a Zanpakuto that reaps lives Hisagi said that once it targets someone, it will keep pursuing its target, even if that target is its own master, until the fight is settled… Youre saying it stakes its own life to kill Man…Hisagi sure has a difficult Zanpakuto… Yeah… As usual, you keep running from my blade! While you fight by hiding, as usual… I dont like the way you always try to pull a surprise attack on people! I dont care! My goal is to reap your life! Its meaningless to debate our methods just for that! Bakudo 62, Hyapporankan! You bastard… This is what you were aiming for right from the start… Who knows At any rate, until you attack me head-on, I have no intention of settling our fight!

" Zanpakuto… Their shape and abilities are based on their Soul Reapers soul Soul Reapers gain power by learning their names and synergizing with them They are born with Soul Reapers and die with Soul Reapers That is what Zanpakuto are I sense some faint spiritual pressure Lets split up and find it – Okay! – Okay! Leave it to me! Hey! Can you handle this on your own Dont treat me like a kid! I found one! Youre a sword beast, arent you Dont move! NARUNOSUKE This is weird! I mean… hes a Zanpakuto Well, Im a Zanpakuto too, but… No, I like older men I dont like wimpy-looking guys who are clearly younger than me I couldnt care less about him I prefer slightly chubby older guys to string beans like him But… This is bad! Sparks are flying! Damn it! Are you all right This is weird I like gutsy, testosterone-driven, manly men Not weak and pathetic guys like him Sorry, but a sword beast is a sword beast! I need to get rid of you! Dont look at me like that! Hes triggering my maternal instincts! I guess I have no choice How are things on your side Im finished My side is fine Well Did you find him Yeah You dealt with him, right Yeah… Hey, Rangiku… What is it Did something happen No, its nothing! Theres nothing out of the ordinary! Yeah! Hey… Hey… Matsumoto! Oh, Captain… What are you doing Never mind that! Youre slacking off again! Thats because I was going to eat the manju I had been saving, but it disappeared! You ate it, didnt you Why would I do that! Besides…dont hide manju! Hyorinmaru, get me some tea! You must think my Zanpakuto is your housekeeper, or something That aside, we still arent done eliminating all of the sword beasts Dont let your guard down! Okay… By the way, where is Haineko Who knows Probably loafing around somewhere Is this really okay I dont belong to an organization like the Soul Reapers… But still… Hey! Sorry to keep you waiting! Tadah! There we go! Thank you very much Umm… Why are you doing this Why Arent I an enemy you should be chasing down So why did you treat my wounds Im not petty enough to attack an injured opponent Besides… unlike the other sword beasts, youre not aggressive at all Its no big deal! Im just saying anything Well, whatever! He seems perfectly normal! Youre a sword beast, arent you Thats the name you all have given me Im just a regular Zanpakuto who has lost his master My master was a cowardly Soul Reaper Unfortunately, Im just like him In order to survive, I needed to protect myself I needed to become stronger I tried to become friends with the other sword beasts… But in the end, I ended up being hunted down Thats why Im hiding like this Your injuries are still pretty bad You should rest! Sorry W-What Is there something on my face Youre different from the other Zanpakuto and the Soul Reapers You think so All right! Then Ill do something about your situation! Huh You dont seem dangerous at all Ill ask the others to treat you like a regular Zanpakuto instead of a sword beast! DONT EAT! RANGIKUS Can you do that! Leave it to me! Whats your name Im Narunosuke Im Haineko! Ms Haineko, huh Stop that! You make me sound old Then Big Sister Haineko That makes me sound even older! Thats impossible Huh We dont know when Zanpakuto whove lost their owners will go out of control Theyre dangerous We have to deal with all of them in the same way But there may be sword beasts who arent dangerous! I wish that were true But we know from Squad 12s research that while each sword beast is different, there is a high possibility that they will eventually lose their minds and go out of control Our job is to stop them before something terrible happens So why are you asking me this Did you find a new sword beast No! Its nothing! I was just curious! See you later! A Soul Reaper would dispose of even a kid like him… I cant mention him to them! But she mentioned that sword beasts have a high possibility of losing their minds… Does that mean there are sword beasts who havent! Thats right! Hes different! He said he was a regular Zanpakuto who had lost his master If I explain things to Rangiku,  Im sure shell understand! You like younger guys No way Gross That might be a problem Oh, Haineko! How do you do Anyway, Ive got to do something about it myself! Is it good Yes! Very! I cant imagine a kid like him going out of control Hes definitely not a sword beast! Hes a regular Zanpakuto! Im going to eat with you! By the way, am I still going to be treated as a sword beast Did you talk to someone about that O-Oh! That! I asked my Soul Reaper about that! She said she would talk to her superiors about it It seems theyre kind of busy right now, so it might take some time! I see A-Anyway, about my Soul Reaper… Shes an odd woman! Shes not a bad person, but she did something funny recently… Thats so amusing! Isnt it! Are you all right Y-Yeah… You still havent healed up completely… You should rest a little more Thank you, Miss Haineko When Im with you, I feel relaxed R-Really I wonder what happened to her Who knows Im back! What Whats wrong! Dont you think its wonderful to be alive Dont you, dear Rangiku! D-Dear Rangiku What Theyre becoming more frequent! Hello! I brought lunch again! I brought a little sake too! You can drink, right Your wounds should be better now, so have a drink with me Miss Haineko … Sorry I still cant have fun like you can Huh How am I going to be dealt with You told me that you would handle it! Were you lying No… Um… To tell you the truth… I see… Im sorry Its not your fault A sword beast is just a sword beast My situation has not changed, but it cannot be helped Where are you going! If I stay here, Soul Reapers will come after me again I need to escape before that happens Its impossible! Not in the state youre in My wounds have healed Thanks to you Im grateful Not yet! Besides… Are you all right! Narunosuke! This is… But we know from Squad 12s research that while each sword beast is different,  there is a high possibility that they will eventually lose their minds and go out of control Im all right now I get headaches sometimes And my hands start to do things on their own Lately, Ive been worrying that theyve become more frequent Whats wrong Nothing That aside, you need to stay here until you no longer have those headaches Youre very kind Our supplies Thats right Weve been missing a lot of things lately Someone is taking medicine and food from the barracks Do you know who it might be No But there may be sword beasts who arent dangerous! Whats wrong You noticed Of course I did Where were you Just hanging around So what did you want Umm… Well… By the way, did you know that someones been stealing medicine and food from our barracks What I had no idea Yeah Honestly, its disturbing Never mind Its nothing! What am I going to do At this rate… Whats going to happen! Well… Youll be okay You just need some rest! Youre lying! Whats going to happen to me Narunosuke! Are you all right Hang in there! Whats happening to me Youre becoming a sword beast Rangiku!

Wait! Hes not a sword beast! Hes suffering! Hell go beyond suffering Hell lose his mind and go out of control Thats what happens to sword beasts! Im going to become a sword beast! No! There has to be a way to save him! There isnt No way! Miss Haineko… Please save me… Get out of the way, Haineko! Im getting rid of him for his own good! I cant! Im going to save him! Why wont you understand! If you want to kill him, then consider me a sword beast and get rid of me too! It seems I cant reason with you – Growl… – Growl… Haineko! I have no choice! I have to restrain Haineko with bakudo! Stop! Narunosuke! Rangiku! Haineko Growl… Stop, Haineko! Im sorry I couldnt keep my promise Miss Haineko… Narunosuke… Thank you, Miss Haineko… Narunosuke! I was in love with him I couldnt tell him I know Are you all right What do you mean Nothing Youre making fun of me, arent you No, Im not I think youre foolish, though I think I still like younger guys Why Even if I grow old, its never too late Oh, you… Hey, Captain, should we give something to Haineko to help her soothe her broken heart Oh, yeah Perhaps… Right Alcohol and shopping is always good for a broken heart But Im worried about Haineko going off on her own, so Im going with her This is all for Haineko! Matsumoto! Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! Anyway, Ishida, I want you to make some cool clothes thatll make Lieutenant Sasakibe really stand out! Why me! That cape… That was popular in England!

On what basis do you make such claims This all began when you fiddled with the remote control and got us locked up! It was Ashisogijizo that broke the remote control and locked us in Huh But youre the one who messed around in the control room and caused terrible damage to Seireitei!

So thats what happened… Im very sorry Well, cant do anything about the one that got away Besides, if that Sword Beast is wounded— it couldnt have gone far Theres nothing to worry about But… However What exactly are you very sorry about Huh Its more than just about letting the Sword Beast escape, isnt it Well, thats okay… You can work alone, or she can work alone— do it any way you want If working together is impossible, you dont have to work as a pair Impossible Thats right You dont have to force yourself Its not impossible Huh I was given orders, and I intend to fulfill my mission with her! No, you dont have to be so… Excuse me Good grief… Shes a proud young woman That lieutenant is confused You do realize that, right Unlike the lieutenant who is all business, that girl sees battle as a game Catch a dragonfly and she would pluck off its wings… Catch a butterfly and she would drown it in water… Catch a cicada and she would rip off its legs… Its like a child playing Innocent and ingenuous, but merciless and cruel at the same time I prefer colorful pastimes, but that girl happens to be rather dark and malicious It would be hard to accept her after seeing what she is capable of, right before your eyes Especially for that lieutenant who seems very straight-laced Not to mention that the Zanpakuto belongs to the captain whom the lieutenant looks up to I cant blame her for being confused… But still, they are both dear to me… Say… Sorry… This girl goes into no-questions-asked fighting mode the moment someone approaches from the back… What happened earlier was partially my fault But let me add that there are issues with the way you fight, as well Anyhow, Id like to work together with you again to slay the Sword Beasts… Why did I have to insist that its not impossible Hi! Hey! Dont scare me like that! Youre the one who scared me, Rangiku! So, whats the matter You look like you have a lot on your mind – Is it a man – No, it isnt! Oh, its Captain Kyorakus Zanpakuto girl, isnt it Yes… Im not sure if I can get along with her… I get it Its like the relationship between a bride and her mother-in-law, right No, thats not it I get it Its like the relationship between a daughter and stepmother, right No, thats not it I get it Its like the relationship between an ex-girlfriend and current girlfriend… Youre getting colder Why dont you excuse yourself from that mission I cant do that! I have my pride All right! Let me take care of this! Im rather good at helping difficult younger kids open up! Uh, right… Katenkyokotsu! Whatre you doing Shes not very friendly, is she I told you so Being that shes Captain Kyorakus Zanpakuto, I thought shed be friendlier Her master is a charming man Wait! Wait! Wait! Come have some fun with us big girls Us Youre coming, too Me…too You look adorable! Doesnt she look much more sexy Rangiku, I dont think it worked Thats odd… Girls are supposed to respond to fashionable clothing… But that one was based completely on your own personal taste, Rangiku… – Please instruct us! – Please instruct us! This ought to work Girls like her are just shy… But in reality, theyre attracted to older men That goes for both Zanpakuto and Soul Reapers… Rangiku, Rangiku… Looks like that didnt work either SWEETS SHOP This is happiness! Sweets make a woman happiest! Delicious… Its hopeless Shes more than I can handle Give up, Nanao! Could it be No, thats not possible… A girl like her couldnt possibly enjoy a setting like that… But she is, after all, the Zanpakuto of Captain Kyoraku, so… A party You say a party, but… Whats the point of having a party under a cherry tree that hasnt blossomed yet You dont know how to appreciate the beauty of things, do you Forgive me Thats okay, those are minor details… Nanao says she wants to throw a party Just being able to drink with Nanao will be very satisfying You alcoholic captain… Huh Did you say something Nothing, sir Captain, please try to not drink too much Okay Whyre you so concerned about that girl I mean, all you have to do is complete your Sword Beast-slaying mission, right Theres no need to commit yourself to her to this extent At first, I thought she was a creepy girl… But gradually, I began to feel sorry for her… Sorry for her Shes a Zanpakuto… She was born to fight, so she probably doesnt need emotions But she…how should I put it… I dont quite get it, but… Well, give it your best shot then You there, young lady The names Nanao Mind pouring a little for me Thats not a little Id like you to pour for me, too If you pour my drink, I think I might get drunk… You dont have to worry, Captain Kyoraku Youre already drunk Im sure youre too young to drink, right W-Wait Why Wait…please… Wait! Wait! Please You like flowers Excuse me a second Okay, done! Yes… Cute! What Why did you come here Could it be…because you want to see other flowers Cmon Come with me Ill show you where there are many more flowers See About the time when plum blossoms fall, peach blossoms begin to bloom Wait…whatre you doing! No sword Leave it here I knew it… If I approach her normally,  she is rather cooperative… You wanted flowers, didnt you Ill pick one for you How nice to meet you here… Youre! Letting me go saved my life So as payback… Im going to have a lot of fun with you! Oh, no…her Zanpakuto! No you dont! You want this toy How about you play with me instead You see, Im lonely… Pay attention! I wont finish you off just yet I had to put up with your fun last time, so this time youll be putting up with my fun… Hado Number 31! Shakkaho! That was all I could manage in my condition! Since you saved me last time, I thought about letting you off easy, but… It looks like you still want to play! Youre… in the way! Wait there… Ill play with you all you want later… Take this! How unpleasant to see a fight go down under peach trees… You know Youre! If you try anything, shell… Huh Why! Unfortunately for you, my girls want to come home and play with me So, howd it go Did that girl change in any way No… But I think maybe… that was never really necessary Oh Do you really think so Huh What For…me Thank you… Nanao, didnt you think I was even cooler than usual this time Huh Youre welcome to fall in love with me Or did you fall in love with me all over again Its saying things like that that makes you uncool! Oh… Arrancar Encyclopedia Hi there Today, Ill tell you all about how the Espada killed time while the producers were shifting the story around Stark was sleeping Well, I saw that one coming Barragan played chess He looks very serious… Halibel is… What Thats me! If you spy on a womans private life, youll get hurt Y-Yes, maam… Ill be more careful… "
" Zanpakuto… Their shape and abilities are based on their Soul Reapers soul Soul Reapers gain power by learning their names and synergizing with them They are born with Soul Reapers and die with Soul Reapers That is what Zanpakuto are Scatter! Reign over the Frosted Heavens! Roar! Above you! Damn! THE PREVIOUS DAY He went that way! Dont let him get away! There he is! Hey, thats a nice weapon youve got there Want to see whose is stronger, yours or mine – Kazeshini! – Yeah, I know Quit playing around, right Cmon! Cmon! Cmon! Too slow! Damn you… What the hell! Well done, Kazeshini Youre getting quite good at this Whats the matter No…nothing… What Is it over already Abarai Sorry were late Monkeys big butt always slows us down, see What! – No, thats okay… – I wasnt at fault for being – It wasnt much of – late today! It was Renjis! a Sword Beast, apparently Sword Beasts have been appearing a lot less frequently lately Youre right Perhaps there are only a few of them remaining… Reconstruction of Seireitei is making progress, so things look like theyre finally getting back to normal Yeah Youve been eating nothing but sweets lately— Maybe youre the one whos gotten fatter Im a growing boy, so its okay! You and I together are one If youre still growing, then so am I! Hey… That Sword Beast just now… It returned to sword form even though I never struck a fatal blow What! A lovely moon, wouldnt you say Its too bright for my liking Hey Huh Now theres something new Seeing you guys hanging out Whats going on Theres nothing unusual about that Our masters hang out quite often Your masters, maybe So, whats up Something happen to your beloved masters Huh! Whos in love with his master! Youre asking for a reaping! Okay, okay It was just a joke I thought we came here to discuss something Signs of that Sword Beast have appeared… Is that true Im positive… A Sword Beast was sucked dry of its Spiritual Pressure and returned to sword form before my very eyes Its his doing Sword Beasts were originally Zanpakuto that lost their masters and became wild… They have a finite amount of Spiritual Pressure and eventually lose their power and disappear Theyre one step away from dying out Yeah… But this guy is able to take Spirit Energy from other Zanpakuto and make it his own Im able to do that, as well, though… What makes him troublesome is that he was one of those very rare Zanpakuto that far surpassed his masters power Why is that troublesome To him, his master was a nuisance from the very beginning Now that his master died, he can show off his powers to the fullest I see… In other words, hes using his overwhelming strength to take in the power of others to become even more powerful… This isnt good Hes the worst kind of enemy the Soul Reapers could have Itll work out Looking at it another way… If we defeat this guy, the Sword Beast hunts will come to an end Itll be a grand finale for us Waitress! Another round, please! Coming right up! Rangiku, too much alcohol is poison to the body Im well aware of that! Thats right… Shes not a child who doesnt know when to stop Oh, you know me well, Haineko… – Geez… Oh, those two… – Hey stop it, dont get so close! Do you want this Go ahead—you can have it Were sharing the orders Here you go So tell me, whyd you bring Captain Kyorakus Zanpakuto with you Whats the problem Were part of the same squad Wheres the other half She is drinking with the Captain at the barracks Oh really And youre okay with leaving the two of them together alone What is there to worry about with a Zanpakuto I like this Its nice to have a meal with everyone like this every once in a while The food seems to taste better Hinamori… You havent touched your sake Im here today to enjoy the food, so no thanks What Are you saying you wont accept my sake! Stop giving Momo a hard time Thats all right, Tobiume Now, now, lets all calm down Ill accept your sake Will that do Whats up with you, Haineko Youre awfully level-headed today Yeah Thats because Im a mature woman Now thats my Zanpakuto! Well said! Maybe you could learn something from her, Rangiku What! Thank you very much! Rangiku, pull yourself together I cant drink another drop… Good grief…she always ends up like this… Whats the matter We want to take in the night breeze for a bit… Can I leave Rangiku with you Uh, sure, thats fine… Our apologies, Momo Dont worry about it Its nice to talk with your friends sometimes I feel sick… Rangiku! Not now! Well rush you back to the barracks, so hold it in! Oh…give me a break… Just a little more Were almost there! I warned you this would happen! Thank you, Rangiku It was fun Whats got you so sentimental We finally found him Understood Oh boy… I never figured youd get this big… So it was you, after all, Kirikaze You were the one who was most dissatisfied with your master! You have the ability to transform into mist You used that power to enter the bodies of others and suck away their Spiritual Pressure… Thats disgusting But to grow this massive from stealing the power of other Sword Beasts… Anyway, lets get started Cmon, cmon, cmon! He turned himself into mist! What! Scatter! That was uncalled for! Now is not the time So quit complaining Lets go! Why you! Your backside is wide open Okay, thats as far you go Ill show you that you dont have a monopoly on sucking away Spiritual Pressure Wow, that was quick We didnt all have to come… Whats wrong! This cant be! Undo your technique! Bastard! Guess this is as far as I can go… Look out! Sir Gonryomaru! Roar! Above you! Damn! Renji! Bakudo Number 63! Sajosabaku! Hes going to transform into mist! Ive put a stop to that Lady Rukia! Whats the matter with you Youre in the middle of a battle— dont let down your guard! Come on, pull yourself together Youre ruining a pretty face Rangiku…why are you Did you think we didnt realize something was going on Momo… Stupid fools! Whatd you come here for! Whos the fool here What can you do in your condition All of you are also reaching your limits, arent you! Everyone… Its okay Right now, just concentrate on the enemy! But this Sword Beasts ability is too dangerous for Soul Reapers Shes right! Thats why we came without telling you… Shut up! What are we to you! Swords alone… Soul Reapers alone… are not enough! Only when were paired together can we show our true power for the first time Didnt you learn that lesson from what happened to Muramasa! Dont go doing things by yourselves Renji… Youre right…we were wrong… What! Kazeshini… What Were going to take care of this quickly, right So give me a hand Right Hes going after the Soul Reapers! Sodenoshirayuki! Scatter! Pierce! Reign over the Frosted Heavens! Is this it for me Sir Hyorinmaru! I cant do any more with the Spiritual Pressure I have left… Dont give up! We told you—youre not alone! Lady Rukia… Youll be all right You and I are always together Yes! Come, Sodenoshirayuki! Dance, Sodenoshirayuki! – Tsuginomai Hakuren! – Tsuginomai Hakuren! Wabisuke! Tobiume! Kazeshini! Haineko! – Raise your head! – Raise your head! Wabisuke! – Snap! – Snap! Tobiume! – Reap! – Reap! Kazeshini! – Growl! – Growl! Haineko! He cant transform into mist Hes weakened considerably Renji! Lets do this together! Right! Well give you our remaining Spiritual Pressure as well! Renji… We threw all the feelings we had towards you And youve always answered to those feelings Zabimaru… Thats all we need Renji, its been fun Yeah Bankai! Hihio Zabimaru! Hikotsu…taiho! Theyve all disappeared, as we expected… Just as the Sword Beast reached the limits of its Spiritual Pressure, the Zanpakuto became depleted to the point where they could not maintain their manifest forms… Their appearance was a temporary form manifested through the medium of Muramasas powers… They knew this would eventually happen Yeah Theres no need to feel lonely Theyve simply returned to where they originally came from… We can always see them… Dont you feel their presence Yes Its a very nostalgic feeling Though theyre no longer in those forms… They will always be together with us Renji… Huh What is it No, its nothing… Its finally over now… Yes… Lets go back to the Seireitei The producers are finally done with shifting the story around Thank you for waiting, Master Ulquiorra Understood Mind if I have a cup of tea before we begin Dont worry! Ichigos not here yet, so take your time and enjoy… Im already here What! Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! Whyre you here, Ichigo Youre awfully early! I didnt have any scenes and got bored! At this point, youre the main star in name only Dont be so blunt about it! Anyway, lets get started with the next arc! Master Ulquiorras still having his tea! Since when did you become so selfish, Ichigo! Thats the reason why no one treats you like a star! Thats going too far… Huh – Youre too slow – Kurosaki! Hurry up! "

Doesnt that kind of look familiar to you It sort of does Ah, thats what it looks like As I recall Its weak against water attacks Hey, Rukia! Shes not here Sadoyou cant do a water attack, can you Of course not Gah, screw this! Then well beat it down! We just have to beat it down! What the--! I cant pull it out! In fact, Im being sucked in! Thanks When it opens its mouth, I thought it would shoot something out If you knew that, give me a heads up! You pulled out the sword I was about to eat So it talks My body is heavily armored with sand I can easily swallow a sword like that! What! Just as I thought I suspected as much, given its size I keep telling you to tell me sooner! Damn! What should we do You withstood my Cero without taking out that mask Youve gotten stronger Is it because you defeated Grimmjow Or is it because of your friends who continue to fight under this tower Or is it because of that woman That woman is already one of us Even if you rescue her from here, it doesnt change that fact What! Were you relieved that she appeared to be unharmed You dont even know what happened to her on the inside! Rescuing heris meaningless Thats not for you to decide! Youre right Its for Lord Aizen to decide Did we kill it! Sorry Sorry isnt gonna cut it! Up! Look up! I feel twice as drained when fighting alongside with you Sorry Man Its hard enough fighting this thing, but it sucks when our attacks dont have any effect at all Guess I dont have a choice I didnt want to use it against an opponent like this, but Bankai! Shut up, mutt! All right, then Lets go What a hassle Not done yet I can do this I can see his moves and react He hasnt become a different style of fighter just because he drew his sword It just means his attack range has extended Watch closely Watch closely! Watch! Bankai! Hihio Zabimaru! That was a pain in the ass What! Are youserious That was a bit of a surprise But you mustnt compare my strength with the likes of Runuganga Are you all right Yeah That Cero I think wed better assume its closer to an Arrancar than the guardian we faced previously It doesnt look different from an ordinary Hollow, though Its getting on my nerves Abarai, what did you just say That its getting on my nerves No, before that What did I say Something about it not looking different from an ordinary Hollow If you were listening, just say so from the start! So what about it My attacks put everything in a single strike Im always looking for an opponents weak spot Ive been thinking all this time about where its weak spot is And Its abilities may be nearly Arrancar-level, but if it looks like an ordinary Hollow If we cut off its head in the same way, we can defeat it In that case Thatll make things faster! Wait, Im not certain yet Watch me! Im taking it down right now! What What are you laughing at N-Noits nothing Here I go! Hikotsu Taiho! Tsk! I hardly cut you Must be that Hierro of yours It sure is tough But I get the feeling Im able to read your movements better than I could before What The last time we fought, I couldnt read your movements at all Not your attacks, defenses, reactions, speed, or which way they were coming from I couldnt read where or what was coming at all I felt like I was fighting a machine or a stone statue Is the reason why Ive become able to read your movements because Ive become more Hollow-like Ormaybe its because youve become more human like me Sado! What the hell! Brazo Izquierdo Del Diablo El Muerte! Gotcha! - Thanks - Dont mention it Im used to it Butwhats with that arm of yours This I guess its the first time Ive shown it to you Its my new power I see With that things power, you couldve put a crack that reached nearly to the face That was close Butits time I put you away - Its coming! - Oh no, you dont! Go, Sado! Leave the Cero to me! Give it another taste of what you did earlier! El Muerte! Did you think I couldnt see that coming! No, its not me What! You thought we didnt see that coming! Bastard! You werent the decoy! We did it! Sorry about using you as a decoy without telling you Forget it I figured youd do as much You kind of resemble Ichigo You didnt have to say that It isnt over yet! Lets go! Did you say Ive become more human I see You must feel really good being able to keep up just at this level No, you dont We forgot to get the name of that big guy It was Batticaloa Huh!

I suppose you were trying to be clever But have you forgotten You were unable to defeat me even using Getsuga with your mask Regardless of how its used, a Getsuga without the mask is meaningless Kurosaki I got you Inoue!

Could you not put Quincies and wizards together ARRANCAR ENCYCLOPEDIA   Arrancar Encyclopedia!

Who the hell are you Where did you crawl out of! I shot you with all that power, but it didnt go through Youre sturdier than I thought Why you Follow me There are too many things in the way here, dont you agree Ishida, are you sure about this! I already told you Leave him to me Interesting Ulquiorra, Im taking this one Suit yourself Are you that concerned for that man Of course not! Here I come! Youre such a fool Coming here just to get killed If you were going to be late, you shouldve just run away instead Mind not saying things like that You make it sound like I got here late because I hesitated Isnt that so Wrong Its because a dubious scientist took his sweet time healing me Then blame that dubious scientist Because of him, youre going to die by my hands! I hate that dubious scientist quite enough without you telling me Bastard Youre making me laugh Whats the matter Are you getting sick of it The god-like power of my Arbol To create an infinite number of loyal soldiers The power of my Calaveras Even I, who was bestowed creator-like powers by Lord Aizen, could not become an Espada It is absurd for rodents such as yourselves to defy the great Espada! End your life hereSoul Reaper! You piece of crap! Im not falling for that again! Youre quick when it comes to dodging! And it seems youre not even quick at dodging How many would you like this time Huh Is that all youve got Its the same no matter how many of these hit me Theyre not worth dodging At that level, it has no effect Kurosaki Is this woman the reason Is the reason why you wont pull out that mask because this woman is here If thats the case Youre wrong! Thats not it! Then pull out your mask Like hell! Kurosaki isnt able to exert his full Spiritual Pressure If he did, Inoue wouldnt be able to withstand his Spiritual Pressure Oh Looks like something changed a bit Yeah, I dont have time to waste with you either Its all the same no matter what you do I suggest you dont assume that I will do the same thing every time You dont get it, do you This is nothing Unlike my previous attacks, that loosens your Reishi bonds and makes them easier to take away It makes even an Arrancars Hierro penetrable Dont underestimate me, small fry! Quite impressive You have the spirit to continue to fight, even against such a large number of soldiers I must say, Soul Reaper, you have limitless energy However, this battle is also limitless Allow me to be your endless opponent Pushed back by these numbers, I cant get near Rudobon, the main entity At this rate, itll just needlessly deplete my stamina! Renji! Sado! Whats the matter You looked so chilled and relaxed earlier But now youre starting to look stifling I dont want to be pointed out by the one who looks stifling You dont stop talking, do you I dont know what you meant by stealing Reishi and whatnot, but that level of power wont do any good! I was right about that Soul Reaper being more interesting than you! Its too bad for you, after being saved by that scientist of yours I wouldnt go badmouthing that scientist too much if you dont want to regret it later Screw you! Tsk! Where were you aiming! Its useless! Out of options, I see Want to die now When it comes to being a slow learner, youre right up there with Kurosaki Did you think I was just taking random aim at you Huh I wasnt aiming for you I was creating a field to lure you into That was my true aim What is this! I warned you Dont assume that I will do the same thing every time RenjiSado Whats the matter Youre sure taking a long time What about the two of you What happened to the ones below We took care of them, of course! Were already an invincible team, you know! Sado must be quite annoyed to have you as his confused partner What is it with you! We came to help you, you know! No one asked for your help! What did you say! Reinforcements More people arent going to change a thing Ill just send in enough soldiers to match the three of you He can increase the number of soldiers infinitely, is that it Just like some kind of fruit No, fruits dont grow infinitely Huh They will if you keep watering them! Plants arent such simple things Forget it! - They seem to be - For a big guy, you sure like to nitpick! - getting along better now - What do you know about plants, huh Like a plant Howre we going fight him, Rukia Theres no limit to these numbers I want you two to take care of every one of his soldiers! I will go after him Fine Lets go! El Directo! Normally, I cant use Sprenger because it takes too much time during a one-on-one battle But because you played with me, you werent wary of anything, and that helped Damn you Youre really pushing your luck! You can still stand You are quite sturdy, after all Shut up! But be careful beyond that point That dubious scientist gave them to me Ive laid mines especially designed for Arrancars Ishida! You are such a slow learner Didnt I explain to you that luring you into that field was my biggest aim I didnt build that there by accident I knew the locations where I had set the mines, and after gauging the distance between us, built it there I wouldnt move too much for your own sake You damn brat Youre Yammy, who Szayelaporro talked about, right Huh! So what of it! Just that I felt sorry for you If I hadnt shown up, you couldve gone on a few more rampages Mala Suerte I feel for you Dammit! On my way here, I snapped a few pillars at each level, so youll surely fall all the way to the ground Ishida Are you all right Do I look like a ghost or something No, you dont, butjust now Those explosions you heard were mines that Kurotsuchi had me bring They go off if their Spiritual Pressure sensors detect an Arrancar within range I carved out the ceiling of the level below and placed them there That guy, Yammy, never even gave a second thought to my aim of driving him into the minefield, so he fell for my plan Any other doubts I never doubted you from the start You just went rambling on and on Youre an annoying guy Look after Inoue If Inoue cant completely block my Spiritual Pressure with her Rikka, I want you to protect her with your life I was going to do that even without you telling me Sorry to keep you waiting, Ulquiorra Here I come! Heres what you wanted to see My Hollowfication! Come back here! Damn it! How far does he intend to go! Are we above Las Noches ceiling Thats right What! This Spiritual Pressure OhhThis is! Master Ulquiorra Master Ulquiorra has broken through the ceiling! Kurosaki Two things are forbidden below the ceilings of Las Noches The first is the Gran Rey Cero, a Cero that exists for an Espada And the other is the sword release of an Espada that is ranked cuatro and above That is because both are so powerful that they would threaten to destroy Las Noches itself Enclose Murcielago! Dont be flustered Hold your stance Extend your consciousness Dont let down your guard for a moment You reflexively used Getsuga A wise decision If you hadnt done that, your head wouldve been blown off and rolling by my feet right now Sado and I understand each other completely now! You can tell what I want to do even if I dont say it, right You can tell, right Right! Please tell me its so - Illustrated Guide-- - Today, Ill explain the Fifth Tower There are no stairs in the Fifth Tower To reach the upper level, you must either fly in from the outside or break through the ceiling of the lower level to advance Oh The ceiling wall is thick, with many pillars, and is well-made to resist vibration How do you know such things Didnt you just hear me explain To get there, I broke pillars, dug through the ceiling and set mines along the way! Huh What the hell were you doing looking all ridiculous! Oh shut up!"

Exactly The series of attacks just now was nothing more than a ruse to draw your attention away from me If your power is the ability to grow soldiers like fruit, then the answer is simple All we had to do was freeze the branches that created them Its obvious that fruit doesnt grow from frozen branches You shouldnt have displayed your power for me to see Damn it Wh-What! What was that Its Yammy! Yammy! The Espada Captain Hitsugaya talked about! Yeah But thats odd I fought this guy once before, in the World of the Living He was quite a large fellow back then but he wasnt this huge! You mean he got bigger! How could that be! Is he having a growth spurt! Nobut hes definitely different He seems twice as big Damn it That four-eyes Youre not getting away with this Youre definitely not getting away with this! Ill kill you! Now what! Its coming from above the ceiling! This Spiritual Pressure Is itIchigo! Thats enough, Kurosaki The battles been decided Hes an enemy, but theres no need to chop up his corpse Thats enough, Kurosaki Didnt you hear me, Kurosaki! I said stop it! If you do that, youll truly not be human anymore! Stop it, Kurosaki! Ishida-kun! Helpher Helpher Help her I willhelp her I will help her Its my fault Its because of what I said that Kurosaki-kun tried to help me Why I trained because I didnt want to be a burden to Kurosaki-kun I came here because I wanted to protect Kurosaki-kun So why Why did I rely on Kurosaki-kun at the very last moment Wait, Kurosaki-kun! Kuosaki-kun! Kurosaki-kun! Kurosaki-kun! Kurosaki-kun! Kurosaki-kun! My arms, legs and torso are regenerating, but its all just a sham My organs that he blew away will never come back If it hadnt ended with that blow just now, that would be me lying there dead The holeclosed High-speedregeneration Ku-Kurosakikun Didnt I get a hole blown through my chest! Kurosaki-kun Inoueare you all right Ishida! Youve finallysnapped out of it That wound Did I do that Youre a hard guy to kill Ulquiorra Pick it up Lets finish this Am I the onewho stabbed Ishida Like I care Was it also mewho cut off your left arm and leg If thats so, then cut off my left arm and leg Kurosaki-kun! The entity that was fighting earlier was me in Hollowfication, with no consciousness That wasnt me If were to settle this, I have to be in an identical condition to yours, or we wont be evenly matched! Hold on, Kurosaki! Do you know what youre saying! Kurosaki! Fine If that is your wish, then I will oblige Tsk So this is it Kill me Make it quick I have no strength left to even walk If you dont kill me now, this duel will remain unsettled forever I refuse What I said I dont want to! This is This is no way to win! To the very endyou just wont do as I want Just when I was finally beginning to become a bit interested in you people Are you afraid Its over You will die here, all alone, with no contact with anyone Im asking if you are afraid I am not afraid Because everyone came to rescue me My heart is with theirs Such nonsense Because your friends came for you, you are not afraid Do you really mean those words Yes What is heart If I rip open your chest, will I see it inside If I split your skull, will I see it inside Are you afraid of me, girl Im not afraid Im not afraid I see I see now In this palm is a heart The Yammy that fell down from the tower Who does it belong to If we find someones belongings, we must return them to the owner! But if that is the case, then we are obligated to receive five to twenty percent worth of Yammy Th-That, I wouldnt want Complete Quincy What do you have to say for this! I-Im not the one who did it! Unforgivable! A-All right! Ill hand over Ichigo, once everything is over! Do whatever you want with him, for all I care! Of course you will! St-Stop taking it out on me!"

We cant I beg your pardon A Spirit Restriction Seal is automatically secured onto our bodies when a captain-class person passes through the Senkaimon Its purpose is to limit our Spiritual Pressure to extreme levels, so that the immense Spiritual Pressure of captain-class individuals does not unnecessarily affect spirits in the World of the Living Gentei Kaijo means removing the Spirit Restriction Seal and releasing our true Spiritual Pressure However, in an emergency, it is possible to pass through by removing the automatic seal function of the Senkaimon before entering What You mean This time, we entered the World of the Living without getting a Spirit Restriction Seal Theres no seal anywhere on your body, is there Youre right, there isnt one Which means If its Gentei Kaijo you want, we are already in a Gentei Kaijo state!

You fool How can you let your guard down Its bad enough youre lacking in brain and strength Oh, Im sorry Wait a second! Thats harsh, Captain! The brain part was unnecessary, you know! That Halibel is putting on quite a show Now the enemy must learn the pain of her sacrifice Sacrifice Yes Each Espada signifies an aspect of death A mortals death results from those ten aspects It is also the basis behind each Espadas abilities, beliefs, and reason for existing Loneliness Emptiness Despair Destruction Intoxication Insanity Greed Rage And Halibel signifies the aspect of death known as sacrifice That lethal power shall consume the brat, leading to his death Too soft Ive seen through that technique! Dont underestimate me You should have realized by now My ice-snow type Zanpakuto turns water of any kind into a weapon Even if that water is your weapon Your attacks will never reach me if all you can do is manipulate water It can, and it will If you want to see it, I will show you Come Do you think Id fall for your taunts and close the distance between us Thats what I mean by you underestimating me! Youre the one who is underestimating me Hirviendo You realized my water could become your weapon, but you must also consider the possibility of the opposite being equally true Such is the ironclad rule of battle Cascada Captain Komamura! Dont worry That shock wave was nowhere near here More importantly, hurry and finish up their treatment Yes, sir But so many are hurt so badly Theres no way I can do this in time alone This force field isnt impenetrable, either Captain Komamura is the only one who can stand against them If they attack Come on out Did you think you could trick me with that That was close I somehow managed to avoid it by quickly putting up a wall of ice, but if I got caught by that force, I wouldnt have lasted a second I dont stand a chance against her with an ordinary defense What are you doing Dont tell me you finally realized your situation and chickened out If the enemys weapon is ones weapon, then the opposite must also be true, you say I dont need to hear your old-fashioned lectures for me to understand that Gunchotsurara! Its the same regardless of what technique you use Hirviendo In return for the lecture, let me teach you something The greatest danger comes when you use your greatest tactic That is also an ironclad rule of battle Amusing Im thrilled It looks like youre starting to get serious here What else can I do The idea of just getting myself pounded doesnt sit well, even for me But it seems youre hardly putting your best effort into it Whoa! Boy, that was close If you had attacked me like you meant it, Id be dead for sure Yep You had no intention of slashing me from the start So why go through the trouble We wont get anywhere if all we do is observe what the other might do Things will change greatly if one of us takes the first step forward But thats where the problem lies The moment one of us takes a big step forward Thats what both of us are waiting for Put another way, the battle changes when one of us can make the other take the first step in Arent you getting impatient Id like to see your Cero about now Good grief Why not Ill take you up on your invitation La Gota What is she up to It doesnt look like shes blindly launching her techniques On the other hand, she is aware this technique is not enough to finish me off Her aim is most likely Is it okay for you to look away You seem fast when running away Cero! Cero! No more running for you You fight such a timid battle Cant say I blame you, though You and I are both waiting for the same thing, arent we For this battleground to fill with water so we can strike a single death blow If thats the case, so what It just means I have to think of a plan I have no choice Were going nowhere if she and I are waiting for the same thing Ive never tried this with Bankai, but Ill give it a go! Did you come up with some sort of strategy Actually, I dont have to wait for the water Here goes! This Spiritual Pressure! Theyre so close by! Whats the matter Did you hesitate because it might injure your allies Shut up What do you care Well, never mind Either your allies become sacrifices, or you yourself become a sacrifice Feel free to make the choice Hows this! Sennen Hyoro! He did it! So this is the best you can do What! Are you done If you dont have anything more, then here I come! Damn it! Cascada If I dodge Then the people below will Damn it! Ryusenka! Did you think you could stop me, using a technique like that The volume of water in this battleground has already reached a level that is more than enough to finish you That last Cascada wont even compare with the one thats coming Captain Hitsugaya Captain Hitsugaya No way Captain Hitsugaya Toshiro So you shattered that Cascada But you are naïve Our existence is built upon the noble sacrifices made Instead, you fall in battle from trying to protect your subordinates My subordinates were not simply defeated They left behind markers for me, on how to carry on the fight If I had lost, my subordinates sacrifices would have all been for nothing I hold within me the resolve of those who sacrificed their lives I know that I suffered a great deal of damage, but Its unlikely youll be able to fight at full strength with those injuries And thats exactly why I will Such a waste of effort What is this My Hyorinmaru is the strongest ice-snow type Zanpakuto All water is my weapon All the heavens are under my control Hyoten Hyakkaso That Barragan dude sure is able to memorize a lot, isnt he He didnt memorize it He was looking at his hands the whole time he was talking He probably noted down the lines on his palm with a pen Oh, is that it Hes pretty stupid Just like you What! Arrancar Encyclopedia Today Ill be talking about Halibel Halibels sword release is called Tiburon It has the ability to manipulate water As long as its water, she can freely control its temperature from hot to cold Although once she goes into release mode, her clothes reveal more skin Its a bit embarrassing Its so I dont have to worry about getting wet Whoa, cold!"

Cant figure it out You must be bewildered because you cant decide the nature of my power Remember I said that each Espada signifies an aspect of death It is each Espadas beliefs, their reason for existence, and at times it relates to their abilities The aspect of death I signify is aging Aging, means time The largest and most absolute power of death that stands in the way of all things that exist See When did he!

I was a fool to expect anything from you Go Run with everything youve got Is that it for you, Captain You fool! Dont be so reckless!

Getem! Good thinking You cant attack with your Zanpakuto, so you attacked using other objects But something like this is useless I already know that! How about this! How many times must I tell you Do you really think you can hurt me with this! From the very start, I never thought something like that would have any effect! I dont think this will kill him, but it should be enough to buy some time In the meantime, I need to hide somewhere and come up with a plan that works What Buy enough time, you say You say interesting things No way!

You make me sick! You reek of lectures, old fart Old fart!  You have a foul mouth I dont approve of that Address me properly as, mister I dont know anything about loyalty and stuff like that, but Stark and I are different than the other Espadas and Fracciónes Man, oh man I thought that Cero had me I really like this kimono a lot But I did get a good look When you sense that child is in danger, you show a corresponding response Thats not like you, Captain That cheap taunt is not what you were originally after Maybe not But as far as I can tell, your relationship doesnt seem the same as between other Espadas and Fracciones So what if it isnt Is hitting on that point your MO Whos to say I cant be sure, but Im thinking thats definitely the key to the two of you Youll know soon enough That is, if youre worthy of it Respira! Damn! If that hits me, itll That was close! That one really almost got me!

Anyway, all I can do now is run! Youre working hard at running away, you mound of flesh! Sh-Shut up! You must be jealous because youre nothing but bones!

Why did you call that child The two of us together are one An Arrancars Zanpakuto is the nucleus of each Arrancars power sealed in the form of a sword A sword release means releasing each Arrancars true power and form In the process of evolution, other Arrancars crammed their Hollow powers into their swords But ours is a bit different When the others evolved from Hollow to Arrancar, they divided their Hollow powers into a body and sword We, however, divided it into two bodies When we return to being one, our powers are released Kick about, Los Lobos!

You havent hit him at all! Just shut up and keep shooting! Dont you know Its surprisingly hard to shoot a moving target with a pistol Yeah, I know Then Maybe you shouldnt be wasting those shots Stark! Ive figured out the pattern of your actions You parried that well I think Ill have to change how I read your actions Bushogoma! Youre wasting your time I wont let you do that I know your right pistol cant shoot anymore! Im surprised Your right pistol has power, but requires recharging in the holster after each shot Your left pistol is weaker in power, but it can fire repeatedly I was so sure that was how it seemed No one said such a thing Thats certainly true So, what will you do Nothing at all As for the reason You know that best Youve been firing only Cero Ive memorized their power What of it Dealing with your random firing is troublesome, I admit But a Cero is not enough to kill me Even if you are more powerful from going into your released state Eventually Cero Metralleta Running away is no use, you know Wait! Wait a minute! I wont wait A Cero should be effective if I shoot it like this Dont you agree Isnt that cheating No, its not Oh, have you had enough How about doing your Bankai, Captain At this rate Sogyonokotowari Ukitake Did he fire a Cero just now Captain Ukitake fired a Cero! Whats bothering Izuru this time No, theres no way Captain Ukitake would betray us! Hey, hes starting to think positively No, wait! Captain Ukitake is white-haired!

Nothing But I must say That guy was scary, wouldnt you say, Captain Captain Its all in the past now Sogyonokotowari Ukitake Did he fire a Cero just now That was definitely a Cero Ukitake No arguments Its like there are two of them anyways So it wont be cowardly if I assist And I get the sense you have no intention of using Bankai Actually, I was about to No, youd better not Your Bankai shouldnt be used in a place like this, where people might see it Besides, against an enemy like this My abilities would be more effective Hey, you Not you The captain with the white hair Me Thats right How did you shoot that Cero just now Gosh, I wonder how If you shoot again, maybe youll find out I see You have a point Dont you get it Its a trap, Stark This is a Stark! Are you listening! Stark! Shut up You see! He shot back, just like I said! Thats why I told you! Are you listening to me, Stark I see Your ability is to absorb an enemys attack and return it directly to the attacker But thats not all Those five charms hanging from the cord can adjust the speed and pressure of the returning technique to throw off the opponent Just enough that the opponent cant time when to dodge Its a much more malicious ability than it looks, Captain Amazing! I never thought youd figure out that much from just three attempts! Why thank you But Im glad that your power wasnt just some ability that reflected an attack back without any rhyme or reason If youre sending attacks back after absorbing them first, there has to be a limit to what you can absorb If I instantaneously fired a thousand shots at you, you probably couldnt return them I told you not to act uncharacteristically, Captain! I dont appreciate you telling me whats characteristic, Mr Espada And if youre going to talk about characteristic, then my characteristic is being uncharacteristic And here I thought you and I were alike There! Wrong So your plan is to stay close so I cant fire repeatedly In that case Now you cant get near Naturally, your only option is to approach from that side Youre good, all right I thought it was odd of you to get cornered so easily So that was your plan, huh Did anyone say he was fighting alone Hows your body holding up, Ukitake Couldnt be better!

Tell me I dont know Ive never seen him before I thought youd say that You dont think very highly of us I suppose its only natural Whatever It doesnt matter who you are or what powers you have Those things are meaningless to me All are equal before my power Now then Turn to bones and perish Respira Kido, huh Ive seen that you have the power to age the things you touch That is why I have come here All powers are equal if they do not make contact I have nothing to fear from your powers A-Amazing! This guy is really extraordinary! I see What do you plan to do Its no good! His barrier Thats impossible Hisagi Are his injuries healed No I dont even need to ask him that Hes obviously pushing himself Its been a while, Captain Tosen Ive come to express my gratitude Interesting choice of words Are you being sarcastic No I want to thank you for everything youve taught me Ive learned many things from you Im really grateful So now Ill use every skill youve taught me to make you come to your senses And Ill bring you back to the Soul Society! You Make me come to my senses You havent changed Suzumushi Hisagi, I thought I told you Those who do not know fear have no right to go into battle You havent changed at all Even now, your words dont have a shred of fear in them Behind you, Hisagi! You do not know true fear You cannot defeat me! Hey, midget! Stop getting in my way! Cant you thank me for saving you! Who told you to save me! I didnt, baldy! What! Halibel is really going all out against those three Dont you agree And here I thought I could ambush you But you already knew No matter In that case Lets fight head on Aizen Foolish ants Did you think that Kido does not age How laughable! People die, animals die, plants die, and even Soul Reapers die Aging exists in anything that dies The things that people create die The Kido that Soul Reapers create is no different There may be Kido that can last for a thousand years, but there is no Kido that can continue for eternity Its only natural! Eternity is a delusion that was created out of fear of aging! Lets get out, Captain Soi Fon! Were no match for him! Lets swallow our pride and get help from the other captains Shut up and be quiet! Im starting to get bored of playing with ants Lets end this Now then Perish! I told you that it would rot The head, unable to retreat, falls unto the depths of the sea And atones for its sins in bolts of blue, white, black, and red A follow-up incantation Chants added to Kido without an incantation in order to strengthen a barrier How clever But Youre not going to make it in time! Gate of the Dragon Tail! This completes it! Thats an impressive trick Soi Fon! Please lend me your strength! From the captain I need the power of your Bankai! You even know about my Bankai That man He never ceases to annoy me I can understand you not wanting to work with us, who are associated with Urahara But you must also understand this This isnt the time to be saying things like that! Very well then Ill offer you a deal A deal How worthless Even something as grand as this is only good enough to buy yourself some time Rot! Gate of the Tiger Fang! Gate of the Turtle Armor! Gate of the Phoenix Wing! Shiju Saimon! How laughable! Do you think youve sealed me away! How ridiculous! You really are just trying to buy yourself some time! I control aging Trying to buy yourself time is like spitting at a god Though I suppose I should commend your pitiful efforts That barrier is not meant to seal you away What You avoided Captain Soi Fons Bankai by releasing your aging powers on it to detonate it before it hit, and directed the blast away from you In that case, if you were in a place where you couldnt escape the force of the blast, and if you were at a distance at which your aging powers couldnt work fast enough What would happen Y-You bastards! Promise me once more that tomorrow youll trap Kisuke Urahara in one of your barriers for a month I promise All right You puny ants Jakuho Raikoben Go Oh, dear It looks like another one of your allies has gone down I give the king of Hueco Mundo my deepest condolences koe sae ushinattemo Even if I was stripped of my voice boku wa koko de utau darou Id be here, singing my song Echo out from here! koko kara hibike miminari ni kesareta seijaku no yoru The ringing in my ears stole the nights tranquility katachi nai mirai wo oikaketeta I chased a future that doesnt exist sono te wa kuu wo tsukandekita kedo Yet all I caught was nothing itself Listen to it!

Wh-What is this You said it yourself Its your power, the only thing that is absolute in this world I thought it was strange Everything that touches your power grows old, rots, and turns to dust So why dont you turn to dust From there, I came up with a theory You have surrounded your body with something that can stave off your power So if I placed your power inside of you, a place where your power would normally never reach My power But how Wheres your right arm What is the meaning of this Ive given it to you He severed his own arm with a barrier and transported it inside of Barragan! Th-That old man is crazy If your power is absolute, then you yourself should not be able to withstand that power I had no proof of this when I made this gamble But Im glad that I made the right call Curse you, ant!

Is that so Then make it an art to avoid being buried in rubble So Hachi did it His opponent seemed pretty powerful too Yeah I would have liked it if we had settled things earlier Whys that Cant you tell Once a comrade falls, a battle becomes one of revenge You sure He doesnt seem like the type to me Thats what makes him scary There isnt anyone who would be unaffected by the death of a comrade If hes shaken up by the death of his comrade, we can strike when his guard is down If hes angered by the death of his comrade, we can attack him before he snaps You mean they become stronger as their numbers dwindle There are two of us So we should just fight accordingly Well, whatever the case Whoever strikes first wins! Slam! Tengumaru! Thats not going to work! Youre not getting away! Hes moving slower than before Which means hes the type that gets shaken up Ouch Stark! Stark! Why are you zoning out! I thought you were going to avenge Barragans death! Youre pathetic! I told you, its not my thing Ive had enough And it looks like Lord Aizen has no intention of helping us either Theyre strong I get that Ive had enough If we continue to fight, someones going to die I get that Lets go home and go back to sleep Stark! What are you, stupid! Youre Number One! You need to realize that! All youve been doing is trying to act cool You havent been fighting them seriously at all! Did you forget why Lord Aizen appointed you as Number One! Its because he believes in your power! If you dont want your comrades to die off, youve got to fight! Fine! Do whatever you want Ill do my own thing! Did you get him Hardly Hes just not moving Hes planning something, or watching us Whatever the case, we cant make a move until the dust clears Losing your chance to attack because of your previous attack Youre unbelievable Shut up! I still havent lost my chance yet There he is! All right! Jeez! Where is he aiming! Hey! Dont fire on your own! Hes coming, Stark! Thats because you taunted him! You kept me waiting quite a while We didnt mean to keep you waiting! Huh You made it difficult for us to attack or come at you, you dunce! Huh! A talking pistol How unusual What of it! That shaggy head of yours is far more unusual! Quiet down, Lilinette! Youve got to be kidding me! Im doing things on my own! Hey! The intervals between his shots are very different from before Does that mean hes not the one shooting Stop it, Lilinette! I told you, I wont! All right! I knew it You werent the one calling the shots So what of it Why wont you come at me Are you grieving Something like that You idiot! Your opponent is reading your emotions! Thats pathetic! Shut up! How unexpected! I didnt think that you Hollows had hearts! Youre one to talk Youre like Hollows too You had a mask on earlier By mask Do you mean this Lets cut loose! Hey! Why are you silent! Jeez! What are you doing! Go after him! Hes taunting us So what! Theres no way that youd lose! I guess I have no choice Here he comes! Now! Right PlayKinshara! Youre late! If we dont get our timing right, theres no point in fighting him two on one! Sorry As I told you, theres an art to making an appearance in any situation I dont care! He looks a bit motivated now Im not so sure about that Fighting cowards is not my style Otherwise, I wont be able to shine during our moment of victory! Dodge it, Stark! I know That doesnt count as a dodge! Thats not enough to knock down my Kinshara What! Nice, Rose! Here we go, Tengumaru Its going to get a little hot, but bear with it Hifuki no Kozuchi! Shes gone! Not! Youre over here! Do you think thats enough to fool me! You idiot! What are you doing! What am I doing! What do you think youre doing, you idiot!

Save your lovers quarrel for later, after were finished with this battle Whos doing what! Whats wrong Do you think you can take me on by yourself Of course not Dont tell me youre thinking of a plan to fight me three on one Of course not Aww, this is annoying! Im ready, Lisa! Thats enough! I know thats enough Im just making sure What do you mean by Im ready and thats enough It has nothing to do with you It does You two may be used to fighting together, but this is my first time joining either one of you If the three of us are going to fight together, I need to know your fighting styles What are you talking about, baldy! We dont always fight together Our personalities and preferences are completely different But theres one thing that we do share The time in which we can seriously fight is limited We just needed to find out what our opponent was like first You mentioned the three of us fighting together, right Thats incorrect Its the two of us, and one of you Remember that! How amusing Are you all right Of course not They really are strong Youre whining again! I cant help it Whenever they put on those masks, their Spiritual Pressure skyrockets in intensity On top of that, there are two of them Im by myself Youre not by yourself You were able to get this far because you werent by yourself Long ago, you were by yourself But ever since that time, weve always been together If we fight together, well be able to handle two opponents All right I get it Stark I guess I have no choice Theres a slight change in his Spiritual Pressure Where is he Above us, Love! What is that What in the worlds going on! Love Huh Is he I know Hes unarmed Wheres his pistol Who knows Hes making fun of us Is he implying that he doesnt need a weapon!

Dont you think its about time we get serious Ill show them! You know we cant overdo it, right I know that! Stop being so picky! The same goes for you What sort of technique is that Lurking in shadows is a pretty ridiculous technique Im surprised you were hiding something like that Kageoni I wasnt trying to hide it or anything Its just that she wasnt in the mood for it This is why I dont like playing with her My Katenkyokotsu has the power to turn childrens games into reality Katenkyokotsu decides on the rules, and everyone who enters the domain of her Spiritual Pressure is forced to follow those rules Myself included In Takaoni, the person who is on higher ground wins In Kageoni, the person who gets his shadow stepped on loses The winner lives The loser dies Shes a self-centered one Even though shes my favorite sword, its quite draining always doing what she wants Impressive! You understand quickly! Not sure if I can put up a fight against him Takaoni I thought I told you In Takaoni, the person who is on higher ground wins! Whoa! Thats right, I forgot Those wolves are with you Are you all right, Stark Stay sharp! Be quiet If I keep quiet, you wont talk at all! Shut up Say, are you talking with that girl you were with So that means she still exists What of it If I recall, you said you split your soul into pieces, make those pieces follow and obey you and you use them as weapons, right Which is what those wolves are You have good memory So if I take out those wolves, does it mean the damage would go to you instead Who knows Or does it mean that girl will disappear Who knows Oh come on, be a sport I gave you enough clues about my powers, didnt I I never asked for any If I touch the ground, hell use that Kageoni But if I fight him in the sky, hell fight using Takaoni What a difficult opponent Hey, Stark What is it I have an idea Take his bait What are you saying Youll see Just do as I say! Now what should we play next Calling a fight to the death a game Youve got some pretty bad taste! Takaoni! Here he comes! Sorry to do this! I was waiting for that! Kageoni Lets continue!

Lilinette! Hey, Lilinette! Lilinette That was a close one I didnt expect your wolves to be the ones coming after my shadow For a second I thought I was a goner But that same explosion helped me understand your powers Your wolves can only drag the things that they bite into their explosion In other words, theyd all explode and disappear if there were objects surrounding me My Bushogoma was perfect for that Now, then Its finally one on one Im alone Iro Oni Grey Why do I have to fight someone this strong! I was always jealous of weak guys Our mere presence taxed our comrades souls and made them disappear In our loneliness, we split our soul into two I cant recall which one of us was the original Maybe it was neither of us But that was the only way we could escape solitude I was jealous of weak guys If I were weak, I could remain in a group I want to become weak If thats not possible, I want a comrade as strong as I am Thanks to Lilinette, hes moving a lot slower And my wounds are nothing compared to his But somethings not right Iro Oni Grey When he cut me, it felt as if he went deep enough to slice off my arm So why! My arm is grey He has no grey on his body Whats wrong Its your turn Come on, say the color you want to cut You wont be able to cut any color aside from the one you announce Lilinette I can still fight White!

Whats this Youre pretty small Do you want me to devour you first! You!  Thats not possible Who is this A female! But the size of her Spiritual Pressure Its not that of an Adjuchas Could she be a Vasto Lorde! Its no good I cant move Well, I suppose getting devoured by her is much better than some disgusting male Adjuchas Come with me What did you just say Im telling you to come with me Welcome back, maam Yeah Oh, who is that A new comrade A comrade Me Thats right Whats the meaning of this! You may have saved me, but I didnt ask for your help and Im not grateful to you! Despite having to be saved, you sure talk big! What did you say! Stop it, both of you Youre both about equal in your insolence and cockiness Huh! What gives you the right to look down on us, huh! Because I am looking down on you, see You bitch! Stop it Sun-sun, Mila Rose Yes, maam Sorry about that Do you have a name What is it Apache I have no ulterior motive for bringing you here We women are easy prey for the males I brought you here because I thought that it would be better if we worked in a group, rather than working alone Theres no need to chase him down Yes, maam Understood Humph! If he attacks us again, Ill bite off that thing between his legs! My Your mouth is filthier than your looks Huh! You never know when to shut up! Such attitude! And you call yourself a woman Sun-Sun, you bitch! Whats wrong Cant sleep Oh No, its just Why dont you kill or devour the guys who attack you In Hueco Mundo, if you want to protect yourself you must become stronger Thats why everyone devours lower ranked Hollows and Adjuchas to make themselves bigger So why dont you do this I dont want to become stronger through the power I gain by killing and sacrificing another If I cant win alone, then Ill win as a group Thats all there is to it No world is without sacrifices But if we produce casualties, we would also sustain casualties of our own Oh, no! Sorry, maam Dont push yourself I want to be like her someday Humph! Just to let you know, if you get in trouble doing something reckless, I wont risk my life to save you! Well, I wont save you either, stupid! What! Its sweet that you two are getting along, but try not to die together, okay What did you say! You again What do you want Dont make me repeat myself, Halibel It is annoying to see you play around in my sight However, it would be a waste to kill someone of your power Therefore Ive come to you today with two choices The first one, as I have asked you before, is to join my army And the other one Vanish to a place where I cannot see you Of course, there is no place in Las Noches that I cannot see! Halibel! Do you understand! You have no choice but to become subservient to Lord Barragan! Dont touch me Stop! Striking one of my subordinates before my eyes How bold of you You will regret your decision Whoa There are lots of powerful looking Hollows here Whats wrong Did you find something interesting No Its nothing of much importance That aside, since were here, let us pay our respects to the king of Hueco Mundo Humph! Theyre no match at all! Youve been getting pretty bold lately Youre right Although back when we faced Barragan, you two were trembling in fear What did you say! That aside, do you know that there are some strange rumors about Barragan recently Rumors Yes Something about him having many incredibly powerful soldiers with cracked masks Masks Whats that suppose to mean! Thats none of our concern! Master Halibel and the three of us can handle them Who are you! I found you His mask is cracked Then hes! Master Halibel! Halibel Long time no see! Youre Thats right You remember now You made me look like quite a fool What is this sensation! This incredible Spiritual Pressure No Adjuchas could handle this! It might even be stronger than a Vasto Lorde like Master Halibel! What! Cant understand whats going on, can you Of my transformation!! Master Halibel! Dont worry I wont devour you three Ill wipe you all out without a trace! You still want to fight Youre not a very smart female! Master Halibel! I want all of you to run away! But Just run away! Yes, maam! It seems like you comprehend the difference in our strength No matter I just want to kill you I dont care about those small fry Hey, are we just going to run away We have no choice Master Halibel told us to run away We couldnt have done anything about him Lord Barragan told you that youd regret it! Hueco Mundo will undergo big changes Ill eliminate nuisances like you, and then join the top ranks! Die! Sun-sun! Apache! Mila Rose! You bitches! Listen up! Wed do anything, even sacrifice ourselves, for Master Halibel! Dont think well go down so easily! Take a listen to the newcomer Shes so cocky But Im with her Same here All of you! I dont want to become stronger through the power I gain by killing and sacrificing another If only I didnt think that way Your sacrifices will not go to waste! What can you do! What! Ill defeat you with my next attack! Dont underestimate me Your sword cannot penetrate my Hierro! Not yet Its not over yet! I will continue to torment you! Die! That power I suppose its only natural for an Arrancar Wh-Why! A-Aizen-- With the power of sacrifice it is possible to do the impossible Im sorry I gave him Arrancar powers But it looks like I didnt give him the brain to control it Who are you If you do not want to produce casualties, then gain power If the power you seek is your ideal I can give it to you My ideal You want to become stronger for your comrades, dont you If you gain power, you wont produce any more casualties That is your ideal Dont you want to see what your ideal looks like I want you to come with me I shall lead you to your ideal I wont make you sacrifice yourselves like you did just now Even if I made any more of you sacrifice yourselves, it would achieve nothing That is what I have decided I didnt expect this outcome I went through a lot of trouble to gather you Espadas I never expected your gathered strengths to be inferior to that of mine Aizen!

Im not sure whats going on, but it looks like you cant take out that troublesome mask anymore! Damn it Why cant I take out my mask! Does it have something to do with that odd feeling!

Yoruichi Where are you looking Over here Yoruichi!

Ill kill you, you damn bug! Oh good So you can punch That last one only gave me an itch I thought you were some giant fly If youre going to hit me, do it with all your might, maggot Youre an impudent little fly! Ill skip the explanation of what goes into a Garganta If you go the other way, youll get to the World of the Living Got it Make sure to watch your footing One misstep inside, and youll wind up in some unknown space between the World of the Living and Hueco Mundo You wont be able to get back Well, that would provide some interesting data as well What is it Come to think of it, when Mr Urahara saw us off, he talked to us from a high place too What Since youre the second Chief of Research and Development, you must have been Mr Uraharas apprentice or something, right You two are kind of similar How dare you! Bye! Isane Take care of the rest I will, Captain Unohana Ichigo I see Fascinating Ichigo Kurosaki is a fascinating man! Master Mayuri I thought it might be interesting to trap him in the Garganta, but I changed my mind! Ill take my time putting some fear into him once this battle is over Fear thatll make him think of this battle as a pleasant memory! Understood, Master Mayuri Ill think up a plan For a worm, youre pretty tough Dont talk big! Eat this! Cant fight back anymore Its over Ill crush you like a damn fly! Damn it! My finger! How dare you cut off my finger! Im not done yet! You damn bug! Why did you stay behind, Mayuri Kurotsuchi How odd That doesnt seem like something youd care to know There should be more things that are of interest to you in the World of the Living So why stay here What are you plotting Oh How very cautious of you Dont worry Im not planning anything thatll scare you Its just that, at the moment, the corpses over here are more interesting Thats all Once the battle in the World of the Living is over, someone will open up a Garganta from the other side Ill use that to go to the World of the Living, and take my time to examine each of the corpses What is it What is it! I asked you, what is it! If you have something to say, say it! Okay! Well I never expected you to say such a thing I was a little surprised What That thing you just said It sounded as if you were implying that sending Ichigo Kurosaki to the World of the Living would end the battle It sounded as if you believed that Ichigo Kurosaki would be victorious Nonsense Absolute nonsense I never expected such words to come from you, Byakuya Kuchiki Hang on, guys! Kurosaki I want to ask you something You encountered Sosuke Aizen at the Sokyoku Hill once before, right Yeah What about it What did you think There wasnt much to think about He had monstrous strength I was completely helpless He didnt even use his Shikai It was a one-sided battle He didnt even use his Shikai Did I hear that correctly Yeah Thats good Huh The fact that you had such a large difference in strength was your greatest fortune I shall tell you now, Kurosaki At the moment, you are probably the only person in the World of the Living, Soul Society and Hueco Mundo who can fight Sosuke Aizen What do you mean I shall tell you about the powers of his Zanpakuto, Kyokasuigetsu, and the requirements for activating it This is my Zanpakuto, Kyokasuigetsu Its ability is complete hypnosis Complete hypnosis But the Kyokasuigetsu is a water-type Zanpakuto It confuses your enemies and makes them attack each other by using reflections created from mist and water Thats what you told us, Captain Aizen You gathered us Lieutenants together and demonstrated it to us! I see So that was actually the hypnosis ritual Correct Complete hypnosis dominates all five senses It can cause everything about a target, including its form, shape, mass, feel, and even smell, to be mistaken for an enemy In other words, it can make a fly appear to be a dragon, or a swamp appear to be a field of flowers All I need to activate it is to show my enemies my Kyokasuigetsus release Anyone who sees it, even once, falls under complete hypnosis From then on, complete hypnosis takes hold of them whenever I release my Kyokasuigetsu Anyone who sees iteven once! Thats right We, the Thirteen Court Guard Squads, Kisuke Uraharas men, with whom you are acquainted with in the World of the Living, as well as Sosuke Aizens subordinates, the Arrancars and the Espadas Everyone who is possibly involved in the battle in the World of the Living has seen Aizens Shikai Thats right, Ichigo Kurosaki Everyone but you You possess a Spiritual Pressure that rivals that of a captain and you have not seen the Kyokasuigetsus Shikai So as long as I dont see Aizens Shikai, I wont fall under his complete hypnosis Thats right Your advantage is very important in this battle No More accurately, if you lose that advantage, this battle is over Kurosaki No matter what happens in this battle from here on out, do not look at Sosuke Aizens Shikai Ever Got it Thanks, Unohana Im glad I heard that before I went into battle Hearing that is more than enough Im the only one, right Then its decided Im going to defeat Aizen! Youre too slow! I told you, that itches, you worm! Oh His brain isnt the only thing brutish about him If hes able to knock that giant body into the air, hes got some brute strength in him Damn it Youre starting to really piss me off! I am so pissed! Damn bug! You damn bug! But if hes going to defeat him, I wish hed do it quickly Im dying to dissect that Espada It appears Ill be dissecting the Squad 11 Captain before the large one That should be enjoyable too How does it look They are severely injured But I can handle it Please save them I will Ichigo Um, Kurosaki Care to let me run in front of you Huh No, thats okay If youre worried about my Spiritual Pressure consumption, Ill be fine Kurosaki Care to let me run in front of you Yes Please do Im sorry Dont be Whoa The path looks so nice when done by a captains Spiritual Pressure In fact, the difference is so great that its making me sad What are you talking about Were no different in terms of Spiritual Pressure Huh From what I can see, your wounds have healed Yet, you were making a mess even in your best condition Your sloppy Spiritual Pressure is just not suited for this sort of task Sloppy Th-Thats not true! If my Spiritual Pressure were completely recovered, I could do a little better! You look a little too awake to be daydreaming Hold on! Dont you think youre being a little mean! Im not daydreaming, or joking! Take a look at this! I only have a right sleeve, right When I do Bankai, my Shihakusho changes too And it seems this transformed Shihakusho is also part of my Bankai As proof of that When Inoue healed my wounds earlier, only part of my Shihakusho was fixed Normally when Inoue heals me, itd fix my Shihakusho as well So I asked her why Apparently, Inoue can heal wounds quickly, but it takes her a while to revive a persons Spiritual Pressure But Rukia and the others were in trouble, so I hurried off I went off without having my Spiritual Pressure restored So this is all the Spiritual Pressure I have right now! See If I were at my best, I could do better! Impossible His Shihakusho is less than half of what it usually is Does that mean that he only has half of his Spiritual Pressure I was under the impression that his Spiritual Pressure rivaled that of a captain at his best! Kurosaki, you should run in the front Im going to restore your Spiritual Pressure as best as I can while were on the move On the move While were running You can do that I can When healing with Kido, we start by restoring ones Spiritual Pressure The restored inner Spiritual Pressure and the healers external Spiritual Pressure then heal the body itself Okay In other words, restoring the Spiritual Pressure in a body that has been healed is quite easy Please move to the front, Kurosaki O-Okay If this really is only half of his Spiritual Pressure He may really be our trump card! Someone who can end this battle Ive got you! Get away from me, you damn bug! That hurts! You bastard! One more! M-My leg! Good, I was getting tired of waiting I almost fell asleep But now it looks like I can begin dissecting Nemu, prepare to dissect Yes, Master Mayuri He finally went down He was pretty tough Hey, are you done, big guy Hey, Byakuya Kuchiki! Hes no good! Ill let you handle the rest! I dont know what you mean by that What are you, stupid You must be bored from watching all this time We just need to finish him off Im letting you take care of that I see Youre telling me to clean up after your unfinished job Who do you think you are What I dont like finishing off those who are weaker than I am Stop complaining and do it! I refuse Finishing someone off is a job that is suited for a brute like you What! Damn it Damn it!

Captain TosenIIm afraid of battle! Afraid of battle, huh Thats why you should remain an officer The most important thing for a warrior to have is not power It is a heart that fears battle A heart that fears Thats right Even Im afraid of battle You, Captain Tosen I cannot see How can I not be afraid of battle Holding my sword and even taking a step forward like this are incredibly terrifying Fearing battle, allows you to pick up your sword and fight for those who are also afraid of battle Those who are not afraid to hold their swords do not have the right to hold swords Hisagi If you truly fear battle from the bottom of your heart, then you have gained something that is invaluable to a warrior! II cannot understand, Captain Tosen Those were your words So why did you discard everything for power! Right now, what are you afraid of!

Tosen! Is that how far youve fallen! Tosen! Hisagi! Whatisthis power! Bankai! Kokujo Tengen Myo-oh! Tosen! I will do whatever it takes to open your eyes! How foolish Youve seen my power, and yet you still think you can defeat me with the likes of a Bankai The likes of a Bankai That sounds like something an Espada would say Dont compare me to the Espada I have surpassed all of them And, you Soul Reapers as well Have you forgotten your days as a Soul Reaper A Soul Reaper Becoming a Soul Reaper is not what I sought after Tosen When When did you choose this path! Are you all right! Sorry I didnt think that anyone was there Im over here Huh! Thats odd I mean, Im sorry I didnt think you were over there Im Kaname Tosen Pleased to meet you You really are good at hiding your presence Youre big too I may not be able to see, but Ive never been unable to sense someones presence Oh, sorry Its a force of habit Komamura Is that you, Komamura! I see Youve joined the Thirteen Court Guard Squads too! Would you like to join my squad I have a wonderful superior! Im sure youll like him too So youre Komamura Tosen has told me all about you I am Sosuke Aizen, Squad 5 Lieutenant Why did you become a Soul Reaper, Komamura To repay a debt of gratitude toward the one who saved my life A debt of gratitude, huh That sounds like something youd do Whats your reason, Tosen Me Mine is Here I come! You finally drew your sword You sure like to take your time Are you scared Its no use trying to ignore me No matter how strong you are you must still have your doubts You said it yourself a hundred years ago I never opened up to you, I never gave you any information, and I never tried to get too close to you Thats why you dont know what my zanpakutos power is Do you think I cant do anything unless I know its power Who knows But I already know that your zanpakuto controls your opponents senses Are you saying thats my disadvantage No, Im not Let me tell you this, Aizen If you think your Kyokasuigetsu is the only zanpakuto that can completely control a persons senses, youre gravely mistaken Collapse Sakanade! How naive I already know your Bankais powers Its destructive power certainly is exceptional He hasnt taken much damage He stopped it with his zanpakuto You said that I could not defeat you with the likes of a Bankai, right What about that But the difference in power between you and Tengen Myo-oh is like that of an infant and an adult Give it up An infant and an adult, huh When your arrogance goes that far, its almost pitiful Very well then, Komamura I shall bring that arrogance of yours to the ground His speed boosted in an instant! Where are you looking Myo-oh! You and that thing are linked with the same movements And if you damage the giant, youll be harmed as well What an inconvenient Bankai, Komamura As one who has seen your Bankai several times, its easy for me to target its weakness Because of its immense destructive power, you never believed that an enemy couldnt be beaten in a single blow, let alone counterattack Even if I dont target your vital spots, if I continue to damage your limbs, sooner or later, you will not be able to move The same goes for you too The same Dont put me on the same level as you! Instant Regeneration! Youve really given up being a Soul Reaper, havent you, Tosen Given our current situation, you sound like a sore loser, Komamura I recall you said my power was that of corruption You said that tricking my friends and subordinates to gain power was corrupt Then I ask you this If someone who joined an organization for revenge were to forget his purpose and live peacefully while working for that organization, wouldnt that be corruption as well To my unseeing eyes, that appears far more corrupted Tosen Was your reason for becoming a Soul Reaper Revenge I love the night sky, Kaname Because the night sky is similar to the world Its engulfed in darkness, and has many small lights But there are clouds that try to shroud them Kaname, I want to become someone who removes those clouds I want to remove the clouds so not a single light is lost, Kaname Im going to get married, Kaname Hes a Soul Reaper Also, I got a notice of acceptance yesterday at the Academy Im going to be a Soul Reaper Im going to be a Soul Reaper and fight Hollows Im going to create peace I wanted you to hear it first, Kaname Congratulations Let me know if theres anything I can help you with Thank you But I want you to remain just the way you are And I want you to listen to my stories when I come back from missions She said that it was a promise She sounded as if she was smiling That was the last I heard of her She never came back The man who killed her was her husband He killed a colleague over a petty disagreement When she scolded him for it, he killed her too She wished for world peace more than anyone She had a stronger sense of justice than anyone Because of that, she had chosen to fight But she couldnt even do that What was lacking Is a belief in justice not enough to attain world peace In that case, I want power I want the power to grant peace If justice is not enough, I will become justice itself And then I will wipe out the evil of the world like clouds I will put my sense of justice at stake Revenge, huh Thats right You sound surprised, Komamura Youve become reliant on your seeing eyes and have become too lazy to see the truth Your eyes cannot see a single truth that I can see! Too slow! Whats wrong, Komamura Have you lost the will to fight back Then let me ask you this Didnt you ever think it was strange Someone joining the organization that killed his most precious friend Why didnt you think that was strange! I thought it was out of a sense of justice I believed that it was to fulfill the desire for justice that your fallen friend had been unable to achieve Youre right It was for justice! In that case In that case, what is justice! Is it to forgive the man who killed my beloved friend! That is certainly virtuous! Its admirable! Sickeningly so! But even if something is virtuous, is it justice! No! Living peacefully without avenging the dead is evil! I understand It seems that I misunderstood your feelings If those are your true feelings, you and I will never see eye to eye So are you going to kill me because of that Is that justice How absurd Thats right Its justice If our beliefs are incompatible, theres no point in trying to reason with you I must kill you for the sake of the Soul Society I dont want to kill you Im glad that I heard your true feelings Ive already forgiven you Forgiven me, you say You talk as if youre God, Komamura When did I ever ask for your forgiveness! If you want to kill me, then do it! That is if you can still say the same thing Suzumushi Hyakushiki Grillado Grillo! I can see I can see! I can see, Komamura! I can see, I can see, I can see, I can see! So this is the sky! So this is blood! So this is the world! And So this is you Komamura You are much uglier than I imagined koe sae ushinattemo Even if I was stripped of my voice boku wa koko de utau darou Id be here, singing my song koko kara hibike Echo out from here! miminari ni kesareta seijaku no yoru The ringing in my ears stole the nights tranquility katachi nai mirai wo oikaketeta I chased a future that doesnt exist sono te wa kuu wo tsukandekita kedo Yet all I caught was nothing itself Listen to it! Listen to it! deai ga tsumuideku merodi The melody of the people we meet Listen to me! Listen to me oto ni kawaru as I become sound ima wa mada konna ni chiisa na kono koe ga Though my voice is still small and meager today itsuka wa tsuyoku hibiiteiku kara One day it shall gloriously resound Listen to it! Listen to it! yasashiku yuriokosu merodi The sweet melody thatll awake you from your slumber Listen to me! Listen to me! My song will reach the person you want to be kimi ga omou kimi e All people, every one of them, are evil In order to make themselves believe that theyre good, they need to convince themselves that someone else is more evil Arrancar Encyclopedia Today, well be talking about Kaname Tosen Kanames sword release is Grillado Grillo But you know, I dont really want him coming around here in that form Damn, he came! You shouldnt judge others by their looks Ah Thats a nice sound On a side note, if I make this sound, my friends who make the same sound show up Huh Whoa"

And So this is you Komamura You are much uglier than I imagined When When did you become like this Whats wrong, Komamura Why arent you coming at me So Im ugly, am I I recall you loathed your ugly appearance Did it bother you that much to hear those words coming from me Thats not it Then what I pity you What You cannot see as well as you did before you changed into that form I cannot see as well, you say Dont make me laugh! In that case, what do you see! What can you see that I cannot! Tell me, Komamura! Whats wrong I thought you could see things better than I could Your sword has an interesting shape Nice, isnt it You cant borrow it, though But I dont sense anything different Perhaps I misheard what you said about controlling ones senses What are you talking about Things are already different Oh, my Whats this Do you smell something good Its too late to hold your breath Welcome to the inverted world Tosen I dont want to kill you But if you truly cannot see anymore I will kill you in the name of justice! Justiceyou say How dare you! You cannot see as well as you did before Do you understand what I mean by that Im not talking about your sight When you were blind No Even before then, you were able to see many more things! What do you know about me! When! When did you close your eyes to the world before you! Silence! Are you mocking me! Now I can clearly see your ugly appearance! Indeed, you can see me right now But right now, you cannot see the essence of my being Which would be my heart Heart, you say Dont act as if you understand Heart A heart! In that case Can you see it! Can you see my heart! Why did you become a Soul Reaper, Komamura To repay a debt of gratitude toward the one who saved my life A debt of gratitude, huh That sounds like something youd do Whats your reason, Tosen Me Mine is for justice She loved this world So I became a Soul Reaper to bring justice to it I didnt want the justice she sought to bring to disappear I decided that I would give my life to carry on her dream Thats why I became a Soul Reaper Tosen I noticed a small lie within the words you said back then You talked a lot about how she loved the world But you never said that you loved the world Then I realized That this man actually hates the world I fully understand In fact, I was glad you felt that way Anyone would think the same if they were to lose a loved one I was glad to know you were not some saint who could say that he still loves the world despite that That is why I decided to become your true friend If youre sad, you can share it with me If Im happy, I will share it with you If you stray from the path, I will scold you If you make a mistake, I will forgive you If youre in trouble, you can rely on me I will help this man, who hates the world, love it once more Los Nueve Aspectos Tosen Shall we end this, Komamura Justice is not something you can see with your eyes It is also not something that can be described in words Im sorry, Tetsuzaemon Im sorry, Hisagi Im sorry, Tosen I cannot kill you You really arent Captain Tosen anymore When you couldnt see, you could have easily dodged this attack Reap Kazeshini! Why is that man not going to be executed! I request an audience with the Central 46! Please! Please! Why Why Why Why Why Welcome to the inverted world This is the power of Sakanade It reverses your opponents sense of direction Its like a trap in a puzzle game Isnt it amusing Then again, you probably dont play video games Do you! This certainly is interesting Everything is reversed Up and down, left and right And even front and back Did you think I wouldnt notice It seems you didnt notice Up and down, left and right, and front and back are reversed And The direction youre facing and the direction which youre being attacked from is also reversed Up and down, left and right, front and back The direction from which youre taking damage Can you really fight while reversing all of that inside your head Its impossible No one can do that Whether youre a Soul Reaper, an Espada, or a human, the sense you use the most is sight You fight by using visual information But Sakanade makes it impossible to fight based on sight Even if youre able to react, its impossible to control your reflexes Unfortunately, the stronger you are and the more used to battle you are, the more your body will react to the things you see in battle! Im over here! Whats wrong, Aizen! Im getting the better of you! Ive got you! Not bad, Aizen Even though everything is reversed, you managed to dodge my double and triple bluffed attack Youre really impressive But It ends here This is the end, Aizen! So thats it It was all nothing more than a visual illusion What! You were talking about battles that rely on sight Did you really think I was fighting that way Wh-What do you mean Theres nothing to be surprised about You judged where I was based on how you saw me fight using your five senses If I change your senses a little, the rest is easy Your power is a far cry from my ability to control all five senses Its childs play, Shinji Hirako Who is this Thats odd This wasnt how it was supposed to happen Who is this I cant see I cant see anything Anything Komamura Hisagi Dont speak Your Hollow powers are allowing you to breathe, but your throat is slashed You dont need to speak Tosen Before we fought, you said that you knew we would cross blades someday To tell you the truth As we were fighting, I felt the same thing The same probably goes for Hisagi Our relationship was a fleeting one It was our fate to cross blades and come to understand each other I wont ask you not to hate me I wont ask you not to hold a grudge against me Just dont throw away your life for revenge Just like when you lost your friend If I lost you, I would have a hole in my heart Thank you, Komamura Hisagi Let me take a look at your face I am still able to see due to my Hollowfication I want to see your face while I still can Cap- Captain! Captain! Aizen! I wont forgive you, Aizen! koe sae ushinattemo Even if I was stripped of my voice boku wa koko de utau darou Id be here, singing my song koko kara hibike Echo out from here! miminari ni kesareta seijaku no yoru The ringing in my ears stole the nights tranquility katachi nai mirai wo oikaketeta I chased a future that doesnt exist sono te wa kuu wo tsukandekita kedo Yet all I caught was nothing itself Listen to it!

No, wait a second Welcome to the inverted world Its not my cue yet Aaagh! Ow, ow, ow, ow! Hurry up so I can make my entrance, Hirako! Damn it! Ichigo! Ill get you for this, you bastard! Huh"
" [Flashback] [End flashback] Thats right Come on Getsugatensho! This is a battle for all of us Los Nueve Aspectos Shall we end this, Komamura Justice is not something you can see with your eyes It is also not something that can be described in words Im sorry, Tosen I cannot kill you You reallyarent Captain Tosen anymore When you couldnt see, you could have easily dodged this attack Reap Kazeshini Im over here! Whats wrong, Aizen! Im getting the better of you! Ive got you! So thats it It was all nothing more than a visual illusion your power is a far cry from my ability to control all five senses Its childs play, Shinji Hirako Komamura Hisagi Dont speak Your Hollow powers are allowing you to breathe, but your throat is slashed You dont need to speak Our relationship was a fleeting one It was our fate to cross blades and come to understand each other I wont ask you not to hate me I wont ask you not to hold a grudge against me Just dont throw away your life for revenge Just like when you lost your friend If I lost you, I would have a hole in my heart Thank you Komamura Captain! Captain! Aizen! I wont forgive you, Aizen! Behind you! Ichigo Kurosaki! Ichigo! What! Its been a while, hasnt it Ryoka boy He blocked my first attack! Your attack was good, but the place you aimed for wasnt The back of ones neck is any creatures greatest blind spot Did you think that I would participate in this battle without placing proper protection Let me guess what youre thinking You think you made an error of judgment in your first attack You think you should have Hollowfied yourself before attacking You think that if you had done that, it would have ended this Am I wrong Hes right I had to take him down with the first blow I knew that! Do not look at his Shikai In order to do that, I have to take him down with a single blow! I must kill him Kill! I was careless! Somewhere inside of me, I was scared I thought that I might lose control of my Hollowfication I made a momentary error of judgment! Attack me I will show you that your thoughts are arrogant Thats right Come on Getsugatensho! Whats wrong It didnt reach me Is that all youve got Listen well, Ryoka boy Your attacks are meaningless against me You seem quite confident So my Hollowfication doesnt scare you, is that right Thats not what Im talking about Then what Are you saying that my zanpakuto cant kill you You dont seem to understand I guess I have no choice Ill explain it to you in a way you can understand, so listen closely Im telling you that your blade cannot reach me Thats quite the claim Then I guess Ill put it to the test! I tried to explain it nicely, but it seems like I still havent convinced you You could never convince me with that! I do know! Youre saying that you can dodge my Getsugatensho any time you want, right In that case Whats wrong You havent reached me  My timing was perfect I was sure of it! Is this the power of his zanpakuto! Dont worry I havent been using my Kyokasuigetsus powers in our fight This is just my basic strength What! Why are you distancing yourself If you want to hit me, you should come closer Or perhaps Are you afraid to lose sight of any part of me by getting closer If thats the case, how silly of you Properly distancing yourself is only meaningful when youre fighting someone whos the same strength as you Its pointless for you to do that with me See I can even reach your heart just like this Let me ask you one thing, Ryoka boy Why do you fight me What! Do you have a grudge against me No, you dont The fact that youre here means that youve gotten Orihime Inoue back safely And from the expression on your face, none of your friends have died Can you really hate me from the bottom of your heart Its impossible Right now, you have no hatred Youre just fighting out of a sense of responsibility You wont be able to reach me with that The will to fight without hatred is like an eagle without wings You cant protect anything with that Your powerless friends only serve as weights to break your legs Dont let him overpower you, Ichigo Kurosaki Komamura! Hes a master at provocation If you lose yourself, youll lose your life Dont let your guard down Dont worry I know the reason why the captains who went to Hueco Mundo sent you here first I wont let you see Aizens Shikai! We will fight to protect you We will fight to protect you Fight to protect me! What are you saying Thats crazy Youre all in terrible shape! What do you mean its crazy Letting you fight alone is far crazier If you went alone, we cant settle our own personal grudges So dont try to do this by yourself Its cocky This is a battle for all of us You sure charged in without thinking Thats pretty reckless, Captain Hitsugaya We wont get anywhere unless someone attacks Missing this opportunity would be playing into your hands I commend you for not using your Kyokasuigetsu from the start! I commend you as well for having the wisdom to not face me alone Are you saying Im playing dirty, Captain Aizen If thats how youre interpreting it, Ill correct myself, Captain Kyoraku Toshiro Kyoraku Ichigo Kurosaki I thank you Back there I wont forgive you, Aizen! If you hadnt attacked Aizen, I would have lunged at Aizen in my fit of rage, and I probably would have died Thank you Komamura Aizen said that you have no hatred And that your blade cannot reach him But we know Even without hatred, youve ended countless battles Youve protected countless people Your desire to protect is good enough That is enough for you to reach Aizen I dont mean your blade, but your soul! He sure likes to talk a lot Why didnt you bring Orihime back with you If she was here, she could heal us right away And then we could have fought Aizen in perfect condition Hirako Then again, you did bring back Unohana, whos more rational, so Ill forgive you Yours was probably the right choice for this battle Listen, Ichigo Were going to protect you In exchange I want you to protect the things you want to protect How long are you going to stand there They can only create an opening for an instant Youre going to lose your chance if you do that Dont think that were prepared to die in this battle Were fighting for survival Saving the world is just a cause that sounds good Were fighting for our survival and your survival, so that we can protect everyone else from Aizen Dont fall behind, Ichigo Kurosaki Hold on! Wait for me, Captain! Thats right What is your duty Your duty is to protect that town Go You are Karakura Towns Substitute Soul Reaper Whats there for me to worry about These are the Visoreds and the Captains! I must believe in them Its all right if I ask for their help Ill take a good look at the direction this battle will take! Too bad I was so close You seem quite confident, Captain Kyoraku If you think that, Im doing pretty well For someone whos launching sneak attacks, that is Aizen You mentioned earlier Right now, you have no hatred Youre just fighting out of a sense of responsibility You wont be able to reach me with that The will to fight without hatred is like an eagle without wings You cant protect anything with that You dont seem to know, so Ill tell you The only time a captain swings his sword is when it is his duty Swinging a sword out of hatred is just filthy violence We dont call that a battle Aizen You truly are unworthy of being a captain How interesting You hate me more than any captain in the Thirteen Court Guard Squads I never expected you to say that Are you saying that youre not directing any hatred at me with your sword Or perhaps When Hinamori recovered and came to the World of the Living Did all of your hatred disappear How rude Im talking right now, Captain Kyoraku You still love to butt in Its a bad habit of yours Im not very good at listening to men I get bored listening to them Im sorry about that Ill continue talking as I take on the two of you Thats enough talking, Aizen! Bankai Daiguren Hyorinmaru! Its as you say, Aizen My sword is filled with hatred I didnt come here to fight you! I came to violently kill you! Argh! Komamura! Komamura, youre What about me Your fur, its I dont know, all fluffy! Oh, sorry about that Captain Hitsugayas Spiritual Pressure was so cold that my body seemed to have reacted this way So thats your winter coat Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers Captain, how about we stop by for some Japanese sweets Youll gain weight, Isane Ugh Youre right Are you two coming in The anmitsu dessert here is the best! Here, take a look! See See! Kote! Ouch! Ow, ow, ow! Let us be going, Isane Um Yes, maam! Retsu Unohana Skilled in Kendo"
" Youre kidding, right Behind you! Getsugatensho! Whats wrong You havent reached me Is this the power of his Zanpakuto! Dont worry I havent been using my Kyokasuigetsus power in our fight This is just my basic strength What! Dont let him overpower you, Ichigo Kurosaki Komamura! Dont worry I know the reason why the captains that went to Hueco Mundo sent you here first We will fight to protect you Fight to protect me! What are you saying Thats crazy Youre all in terrible shape! What do you mean its crazy Letting you fight alone is far crazier If you went alone, we couldnt settle our own personal grudges So dont try to do this by yourself Its cocky This is a battle for all of us Thats right I must believe in them Its all right if I ask for their help Ill take a good look at the direction this battle will take! Too bad I was so close You seem quite confident, Captain Kyoraku If you think that, Im doing pretty well For someone whos launching sneak attacks, that is Aizen Swinging a sword out of hatred is just filthy violence We dont call that a battle Aizen You truly are unworthy of being a captain How interesting You hate me more than any captain in the Thirteen Court Guard Squads I never expected you to say that Or perhaps When Hinamori recovered and came to the World of the Living Did all of your hatred disappear Bankai Daiguren Hyorinmaru! Its as you say, Aizen My sword is filled with hatred I didnt come here to fight you! I came to violently kill you! What incredible Spiritual Pressure Yes And its not just from Captain Hitsugaya Captain Komamura, Captain Kyoraku, and that masked bunch too Theyre raising their Spiritual Pressures to the limit Matsumoto and Hinamori might have a hard time being exposed to this much Spiritual Pressure up close But even with all this Spiritual Pressure Will it be enough If my sword is filled with hatred, then Im also unworthy of being a Captain Thats what you want to say, right Thats right As long as I can kill you in this battle, I dont care if I lose my position as a captain I will do everything I can to crush you I wont give you a chance to use your Kyokasuigetsu Oh You wont give me a chance to use my Kyokasuigetsu Thats right Get ready, Aizen! You dont even look like you want to fight Fine Even if you dont, I wont hold back! Youre not going to give him a chance to use his Kyokasuigetsu This is not good Youve completely misunderstood Captain Aizens power Hyoryusenbi! Hyoryusenbi Zekku! Tenken! Tengumaru! Forgive me, Captain Hitsugaya! Im going to interfere! You may not like this, but nows not the time to be complaining! Do whatever you like I never planned to fight him one-on-one from the beginning Thats a good attitude to take I couldnt follow his movements What incredible speed Group attacks, sneak attacks, distractions, decoys Unless you combine all of the fighting styles you know, youll never catch me How interesting! Can you stay calm against this many opponents! Thats good, Rose! Keep him like that so he cant escape! I know that! Now! Aizen Hes not even fazed! Hes tough He doesnt even have a scratch on him Did you really think you could crush me with sheer numbers and power How naive No, my understanding of the word power is probably different from yours Let me teach you When I talk about power This is what Im talking about Kokujo Tengen Myo-oh! Kinshara! Thats right Captain Aizen isnt feared because he can use Kyokasuigetsu Yes, Kyokasuigetsus power is terrifying But that alone would not have been enough to subdue those who would rather die than to obey There was only one reason why those powerful Espada were able to function as a group, despite their personal motives Because hes strong All of Captain Aizens abilities are far beyond anyone elses Youre going to take precautions against his Kyokasuigetsu Your plans arent good enough Youre going to take precautions against everything else Your plans still arent good enough Even if you gather your minds, and take precautions against unfortunate events like the sky falling or the earth splitting, Captain Aizens abilities are far beyond your plans A Hollowfication I told you Youre just failed mock Arrancars The Arrancar follow me Mock Arrancars shouldnt point their blades at me Youre kidding, right Has the Stealth Force gone mad I never expected their Supreme Commander to be standing before the enemy Dont expect beauty out of battle Dont expect virtue in death Dont think that only your life is at stake If you want to protect the ones you should protect, you should attack your enemy from the back Ordinary Soul Reapers learn this at the Academy The Stealth Force knows this even better I never expected a traitor to be talking about the teachings of the Soul Reapers Hilarious I was once a teacher Central 46 was pretty stupid for allowing you to teach Thats why they got duped by a traitor Its not good to talk ill of the dead You were duped too, right Im surprised Do you think I was duped Me, of all people! Clones, huh Thats not a bad parlor trick Im honored by your praise The Stealth Force is never praised for its flashiness As thanks Im going to finish you off with this parlor trick! Nigeki Kessatsu Death in two stings, huh What an amusing technique But it wont reach me! What! A battle between Soul Reapers is a battle between Spiritual Pressures I can easily overcome your silly power with my Spiritual Pressure! What! How careless of you You created a shadow on the ice Kyoraku You bastard Its over, Aizen You really are young You recklessly charge in when you see a chance at victory That is your biggest shortcoming, Captain Hitsugaya Oh no! Its the other way around! H-He did it He did it! The captains finally did it! Hey, Kira! Why cant you be a little happier You look unmoved as always! O-Okay Oh Youre able to get upHinamori! Hinamori! H-Hey Where are you going, Hinamori! Hinamori! Hinamori! Good grief We finally turned things around Right, Ichimaru Guys You guys What are you all doing! Hi-! Hinamori! Damn it! When! When What an interesting question You know that my Kyokasuigetsus power is Complete Hypnosis, right It can control all five senses and lead people to hallucinate all sorts of things Since when Im asking you when you used your Kyokasuigetsu! Then let me ask you this When did you think that I wasnt using my Kyokasuigetsu Shiro Why Wait, Captain Hitsugaya!

" Im glad you arent in child form H-He did it He did it! The captains finally did it! Hey, Kira! Why cant you be a little happier You look unmoved as always! O-Okay Oh Youre able to get upHinamori! Hinamori! H-Hey Where are you going, Hinamori! Guys You guys What are you all doing! Hi-! Hinamori! Damn it! When! When What an interesting question You knowmy Kyokasuigetsus power is Complete Hypnosis, right It can control all five senses and lead people to hallucinate all sorts of things Since when Im asking you when you used your Kyokasuigetsu! Then let me ask you this When did you think that I wasnt using my Kyokasuigetsu Shiro Why Wait! Captain Hitsugaya! Youre full of openings Noway I wont kill you Your powers should allow you all to remain conscious, even with the wounds you have received Just watch the outcome of this battle as you lie on the ground unable to do anything G-Guys Aizen! Old man The Head Captain finally shows up But its too late Youre the only remaining Captain who can still fight Your death will mean the end of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads Youve missed your opportunity You shouldnt have come out Dont get cocky, boy Do you think youre powerful enough to cut me I dont think about whether I can Because I already have Silence! Ive caught you, Sosuke Aizen! How interesting Youve caught me; what are you going to do Is the arm youre holding really my arm Im sure you know my Kyokasuigetsus power Are you saying that this is part of your Complete Hypnosis I see If I go by what I see and what I touch then that may be true However, I will never mistake the Spiritual Pressure of the zanpakuto stabbing me in the stomach! You said that I had missed my opportunity Its the other way around An opportunity has opened up Whats that! Ennetsu Jigoku All of your battles up to this point were meant for this very moment You were setting this up while your subordinates were being defeated, huh How devious Devious is fine You will die with me in this blazing inferno Stand back, Ichigo Kurosaki! You are not a member of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads I cannot let you get dragged into this Old man! Stand back this instant! What about the other squad members Theyre going to be engulfed by this blazing inferno of yours They have all come here prepared We will die to exterminate great evil That is the will of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads Behind you, old man! Why Why did Ryujinjakkas flames disappear Shall I tell you Your Ryujinjakka is the most powerful zanpakuto There is no mistake about that If I fought you head on, your fighting power would surpass mine But by discarding all other power and specializing in a single aspect, I can combat even the strongest zanpakuto His name is Wonderweiss Could you tell me your name, my new comrade Wonderweiss Wonderweiss Margera I have an important role for you to fill He is our only Mod Arrancar And the name of his Resurrección is Extinguir Wonderweisss role is to seal away your Ryujinjakka And nothing else Wonderweiss has lost his speech, intelligence, memory, and reasoning to gain that single ability Lost them You mean you robbed them from him This is all the will of the Hogyoku You cannot do anything against the power that Wonderweiss has traded everything for Farewell, Genryusai Yamamoto Farewell, Genryusai Yamamoto Go, Wonderweiss Do you think you can kill me if you seal away my Ryujinjakka How naive Im astounded by how foolish you are How do you think I remained the Head Captain of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads for over 1,000 years No Soul Reaper born in the past 1,000 years has been stronger than I am Thats why I wasnt holding back Youre quite a tough fellow Now then If my Ikkotsu could not defeat you This is going to hurt Are you fine with that Ah yes Your speech has been wiped away No preliminary action for your attack, eh You really are a modified improvement! Youre fast But Youre still a boy You really are tough And your attacks are strong But youre young Your attacks are too straightforward What Is that all Im glad you arent in child form I can kill you without remorse Sokotsu (Dual Bone) Sokotsu How pitiful He didnt take away your feelings, did he What a cruel thing to do Cruel Souls who have become Hollows have no purpose They just devour souls for the fun of it How is it cruel then, to give them a purpose You crushed his soul into pieces Youre the cruel one Im not going to get into a foolish argument with you about that Say whatever you like while you can Itll all end soon A foolish argument, huh You disregard my words Thats why you miss what I say What do you mean Remember what I said I said that Extinguir was created for the sole purpose of sealing away Ryujinjakkas flames That means he prevented you from creating any new flames, by sealing it within his sword But were those the only flames you created Wasnt there more Flames, which you had already released Now then Where do you suppose those flames were sealed into You have a sharp mind, Head Captain of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads Youre well aware of what would happen if all of the power you produced were discharged at once Containing such an explosion is an impressive feat, Head Captain of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads If you didnt use your body to contain it, your flames would have blown away your barrier and this small town and everything around it would have been turned to dust I thank you, Genryusai Yamamoto You have protected my world Damnyou Genryusai Yamamoto, I will not spare your life You are Soul Societys history itself I will finish you off with my sword Dont make me repeat myself, boy Youre foolish! Hado 96 Ittokaso Here I come, Aizen! Wait, Ichigo Kurosaki! What Youre exerting your energy in the wrong place!

Getsugatensho! Im not done yet Whats so funny You failed to kill me, Ichigo Kurosaki What That was my last opening It was good enough I injured you Injured You call this an injury Instant Regeneration! This isnt Instant Regeneration Do you really think that Id undergo a Hollowfication This is just its compulsion to protect its master What do you mean Thats Its the Hogyoku So this is your Spiritual Pressure How wonderful Youve matured splendidly Just the way I wanted you to What! You met Rukia Kuchiki, and following your battle with Uryu Ishida, you awakened your own Soul Reaper powers During your battle with Renji Abarai, you learned about the power of your Zanpakuto During your battle with Kenpachi Zaraki, you got a clue about your Bankai During your battle with Byakuya Kuchiki, you began your Hollowfication During your battle with Grimmjow, you mastered your Hollowfication And during your battle with Ulquiorra, it seems youve gained an even greater power Ichigo Kurosaki All of the battles youve fought were a part of my plan Do you wantto save your family Of course! Is there a way! Theres just one way You must become a Soul Reaper! Give me that sword, Soul Reaper! My name is not Soul Reaper I am Rukia Kuchiki Im Ichigo Kurosaki Damn it Theres no end to them Whats the meaning of this Theres far more of them than the bait I used would draw Its as if theyre being drawn in by some other giant power Sensei Ishida! Its easier to fight against a large number of opponents when youre doing it back to back! Bring it on! Kurosaki! The sky The sky What What is this extraordinary Spiritual Pressure Kurosakis power is increasing Victory! Hey, Hiyosu The Stealth Force has turned in their report What does it say Its exactly as you suspected Its the missing criminal I knew it Lets catch her and retrieve the gigai shes using That aside, Im surprised you found her I dont know why, but I felt like watching some broadcasts in the World of the Living When I turned on the switch, I saw this playing Im so lucky! Jeez I guess your hobby can come in handy once in a while Shut up So when are they sending us her gigai Well, about that Its going to be a while There are formal procedures to go through, so they sent a retrieval team Really Whos on the retrieval team Well Roar, Zabimaru! Look in front of you! What stands before you is your prey! Its over, you damn kid! This is where youll die, defeated by me, Renji Abarai! I wont make it! What! What is this Youre slow Brother Byakuya! Yes, Ill keep pushing you until you can remember that attack! When you dodge an attack, you dont let them cut you If you protect someone, you dont let them die When you attack, you kill! You see my sword It reflects my determination to kill you Damn! When you dodge an attack, you dont let them cut you Damn you! If you protect someone, you dont let them die When you attack, you kill! Hang on, Chad! Ill beat this guy, and come save you! I swear! Sorry Im not ready to die just yet Because if I die, Ill lose everything Ive been fighting for! What do you know So you can fight Ichigo Do you believe in me Of course I do Im entrusting you with all my powers Do whatever you want with it And lend me power! Yes Bankai! Tensa Zangetsu No Bankai could be that small A mere Ryoka could never reach Bankai Ive got him! Impossible! Every single one was deflected! Senkei Senbonzakura Kageyoshi Only those I have sworn to kill can see this form Byakurai Youre at your limit, arent you, Ichigo Kurosaki What My body It wont move! Youre only human No matter how much you endure, there are limits This is your limit Its over, Ichigo Kurosaki! If I dont win, nothing will change! I want to win Iwant to win! I thought I told you Its a big problem for me if you get yourself killed Impossible Who are you! Who am I I have no name! Youre no good after all, Ichigo! Damn! Damn! Whats this You fool! Has he already undergone a Hollowfication Gin Oh Is it all over now Theres no need to worry Everything is going according to plan It all begins now So why did you go over the past battles today We wouldnt want our viewers to forget what happened up until now, would we And I assure you, its not because I had forgotten There were parts I forgot about as well I havent forgotten Really You so did, didnt you Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! Wow, I sure went through a lot of battles in just six months or so I wonder what my high school life would have been if I hadnt fought Well, isnt that obvious Huh Challenge to a Fight Hold it! Why am I ending up fighting here too! Because youre a delinquent No, Im not!"
" Thats because youre a human and So this is your Spiritual Pressure How wonderful Youve matured splendidly Just the way I wanted you to What! Ichigo Kurosaki All of the battles youve fought were a part of my plan Hirako Who are you! Take a good look What is this A Hollow mask! Thats right A Zanpakuto and a Hollow mask Now do you understand Im a Visored Youre the same as me Come with us, Ichigo You shouldnt be on that side Lord Aizen It appears that the Visored have made contact with Ichigo Kurosaki I see What will you do Lets see Call Ulquiorra Lets have him go to the World of the Living Yes, sir! Captain Hirako Still a prudent man, arent you Bankai! Tensa Zangetsu Orange hair and a black Bankai No doubt about it Hes our target, Yammy I saved us the trouble of searching, huh Suerte! Damnyou brat! You need to resort to your Zanpakuto for a foe like him I said, shut up! Zanpakuto! So that sword at his waist is a Zanpakuto! The cracked Hollow mask The hole in his chest A Zanpakuto As I was heading over here, I thought the Spiritual Pressure felt odd Who are these two! Are they like us! Like Hirako and me Damn it! I cant move my body! I deny you So now youll get in my way Damn it! Break apart and disappear! Hello there Im sorry Im late, Kurosaki! Our mission is done for now I shall inform Lord Aizen that the wannabe Soul Reaper he had his eyes on was trash that wasnt even worth killing Im surprised you knew where we were Ichigo That face looks like youve finally decided to become one of us Impossible He finally mastered Hollowfication The speed of his development is wonderful I guess its to be expected Lord Aizen Is that you, Kaname Yes I have made all preparations I see So this is it Excuse me Its nothing important Lets leave the rest to Ulquiorra Get up Get up Get up I I willprotect you! Thats impossible With his bare hands! All of the battlesIve fought were accordingto your plan! What What do you mean by that Im asking you what you mean by that! Your voice Dont raise your voice, Ichigo Kurosaki There is nothing to be surprised about I simply believed that you would be a great research subject, so I assisted your development Thats all Im saying You never thought it was strange You had never seen a Hollow in your life before you met Rukia Kuchiki, but shortly after doing so, you were attacked by one How a Menos Grande was drawn to bait that Quincies use to attract and exterminate minor Hollows When you began to get used to fighting as a Soul Reaper, Rukia Kuchikis previously undetected Spiritual Pressure was suddenly detected and reported to Soul Society You fought Renji Abarai, Kenpachi Zaraki, Byakuya Kuchiki when your power was comparable to theirs You never once thought it was strange Did you think that you met by fate Hold on Did you think that attack happened by chance Wait Did you think your victories were the result of your hard work Dont disappoint me Your power should be much greater than this Dont you believe what I said Of course not! But its the truth Youre lying! All of my battles were your doing! You planned all of it! Whod believe that! You said before that you discovered Rukia after she had gone missing in the World of the Living! And yet you say that you knew about me since the time I met her! That doesnt make any sense! What an interesting thing to say You just called me a liar and said that you would never believe me You claim that Im lying right now So why do you think I was telling the truth back then I suppose it cant be helped I sympathize with you This world was never about truth or lies There are only hard facts Despite that, everyone who exists in this world mistakenly believes that only facts that are favorable to them are truths They know no other way to live But for the powerless who make up most of the world, facts that act against them are the only truths Do you know all of the facts Who stationed Rukia Kuchiki in the World of the Living Who gave Renji Abarais equipment the ability to detect Spiritual Pressure Who added information on your whereabouts in the report sent to the Lieutenants Was I really unable to figure out where the Hogyoku was for over a hundred years Theres one thing I want to ask you You said that you believed that I would be a great research subject Why What did you base that belief on If you saw me when I met Rukia Tell me When did you believe that! Since the beginning Quit talking nonsense Dont you understand Im telling you it was from the beginning I knew about you since you were born What! You were special from the moment you were born Thats because youre a human and You talk too much Aizen Thats because youre a human and Human and what His last word was drowned out by the noise I thought I lost my chance to hear it But I was mistaken I never needed to hear it The answer soon appeared before my eyes D-Dad Hey, say something Dad Ow! That was close! You bastard! Keeping his distance, I see A wise decision I suppose its in their blood Shut up! I know what you want to ask! Be quiet for now I know I have to be quiet! I was telling you I couldnt breathe! Oh S-Sorry No matter how long you stare, youre not imaging things So it seems Ill talk about it later There are probably tons of things you want to ask me, but all of it- No, theres not There isnt anything I want to ask you You probably had your reasons for not telling me about it Thats your problem I dont know how to ask you about that I dont know a good way of asking you about that without trampling on your feelings So Ill wait Until you feel like telling me Until you feel the time is right Until then, you dont need to tell me It seems youve learned some tact I picked it up from someone else Someone told me something similar It helped make me feel a lot better Thanks for hitting me, Dad I feel like Ive come home Ichigo I didnt hit you, I headbutted you Does it really matter You ruined a good mood He hid his Spiritual Pressure He placed a pretty powerful barrier Youve been watching for quite a long time, Gin I havent just been watching I just couldnt find an opportunity or a need to help you I see Its been a while since Ive fought you This time, I wont be holding back Say, Ichigo You sure you dont want to ask Yeah You sure Yeah Really You dont want to know what happened in your dads past I said Im fine! What, really Come on, are you sure You wanted me to ask Quincy Encyclopedia Kurosaki, if you have time to be lazing about, then help me with my work Hey! Are you listening! Ive got some business to attend to Sorry! From Isshin Ive got some business to attend to Sorry! From Isshin"
" Ive reached my limit My limit as a Soul Reaper, that is I knew about you since you were born What! You were special from the moment you were born Thats because youre a human and You talk too much Aizen D-Dad Hey, say something Dad Ow! That was close! You bastard! Keeping his distance, I see A wise decision Youve been watching for quite a long time Gin I havent just been watching I just couldnt find an opportunity or a need to help you I see Its been a while This time, I wont be holding back Raikoho Its been a while since Ive fought you Do you remember the last time we fought Oh, this isnt good Unacceptable A guardian of the gate isnt supposed to open the gates A gatekeeper who lost isnt opening any gates When a gatekeeper loses, it means death When I slashed Jidanbos arm, you got all mad and attacked me What the hell are you doing! Impale him, Shinso! I remember thinking of you as an interesting kid I dont remember Liar Are you trying to taunt me Thats not it Im not saying that I dont remember your sword I dont remember your heart Whenever I face an opponent, I can slightly tell what my opponent is thinking I cant read their minds, but I can tell why theyre fighting, what they want from me, or whether theyre looking down on me During battle, Im desperate, so I usually notice it after its over, but the stronger my opponents are, the stronger their hearts are conveyed Youre quite the poet Shut up You have none of that Even when you were fighting me, you werent looking at me I dont know what you were looking at, though You know I thought you were an interesting kid, but youre actually kind of creepy Youre one to talk I can understand why Captain Aizen is interested in you Do you know how far my Shinso can extend No, I dont The length of a hundred swords When I was little, people used to say I carried a set of hundred swords Im not interested Then do you know how far it can extend in Bankai I didnt come here to be quizzed What, you give up How boring Oh well Ill tell you in measurements that you can understand Thirteen kilometers Must be hard to imagine just from hearing the numbers, huh So let me demonstrate Here I go This time, Im not holding back Bankai Kamishininoyari Why do you look surprised Theres no way a Bankai couldnt stop another Bankai! You know You really are a creepy kid Gin How scary I better deal with you while I can Otherwise, things may get troublesome When did his sword shrink Did I get distracted and miss it No, I never took my attention away from his sword Theres no way that I couldnt have seen a sword that long shrink Now then What should I do You easily stopped my Bankai I guess I have no choice but to fight Thats an impressive sword I feel like mine will break just from attacking it Yeah right Then why dont you break already! If my hunch is correct, he only shrunk his sword He hasnt ended his Bankai If my hunch is correct Once he points that tip at me, its over! At this distance Just as I thought The scariest thing about your Bankais ability is not its length or its destructive force But its contraction I was thinking Telling me about its length serves no purpose In fact, not telling me about it would be to your advantage Swinging your sword and slicing up the town serves no purpose In fact, attacking me head on would be to your advantage You showed me those things to distract me from its contraction Am I wrong! Wow He noticed that in my first attack and dodged my second attack How scary He still has room for improvement But hes not good enough, yet Since youve figured it out, I guess I have no choice Ill tell you how fast Kamishininoyari can extend Did you hear that Its 500 times that speed Kamishininoyari isnt the longest Zanpakuto Its the fastest Zanpakuto Even if you know that, you have no chance of winning Whats wrong Youre getting slower Are you already at your limit Yes, it seems like it Ive reached my limit My limit as a Soul Reaper, that is What My soul is going to be restructured What are you talking about The Hogyokus will is finally beginning to understand my thoughts Concentrate Ignore his swinging attacks Pay attention to when he makes a thrust Dont let him point it at me! Just kidding Youre too jumpy You bastard I swear Ill break your sword! Fine Try it if you can Ive reached my limit My limit as a Soul Reaper, that is What are you talking about The Hogyokus will is finally beginning to understand my thoughts What kind of nonsense is that Cant you tell Im saying that the Hogyoku has a will of its own That sounds like nonsense to me I cant blame you for being unable to sense it Even I didnt know the Hogyoku had its own will until becoming its master What do you think the Hogyokus power is Is it the power to dominate two opposing forces-the boundary between Hollows and Soul Reapers No The Hogyokus true power is the ability to manifest the desires of those around it What! Cant you tell Im saying that the miracles that happened around Ichigo Kurosaki, Rukia Kuchiki, and Kisuke Urahara were all manifested by the Hogyokus will What are you saying The reason why Kisuke Urahara mistakenly believed that the Hogyokus power was the power to control the boundary between Hollows and Soul Reapers is because, as its creator, that is what he desired Rukia Kuchiki passed all of her spiritual powers to Ichigo Kurosaki and lost her Soul Reaper powers because she was still suffering from the pain of killing Kaien Shiba Yasutora Sado and Orihime Inoue developed special powers because deep in their hearts, they hated being considered helpless I knew about the Hogyokus true power No, I suppose its incorrect to say that I knew about it More correctly, I knew that its power was not the power to control the boundary between Hollows and Soul Reapers like Kisuke Urahara thought it was Because if that was really its power, Shinji Hirako and the other Visoreds would never have become complete Visoreds The Hollowfication of Shinji Hirako and the other Visoreds was a Hollowfication experiment as well as a confirmation of the Hogyokus powers The experiment was a success Kisuke Uraharas activation of the Hogyokus power evolved Shinji Hirako and the other Visoreds into complete Visoreds And I had a hypothesis on the Hogyokus power I had Rukia Kuchiki go to Ichigo Kurosaki Naturally, there are limits to the Hogyokus power The Hogyoku has the power to manifest the desires of those around it But if the target does not have the power to achieve it, nothing would happen In that sense, it has the power to guide you to your desires Living creatures are odd things Theyre able to achieve their petty wishes You bastard You stopped that well Thats pretty good for sheer luck Who are you calling lucky, stupid! I-Ichigo What is it! Dont bother me! Ill be able to handle him soon! Dont interfere! Sorry, Captain Aizen Did I interrupt your conversation Its all right I just finished talking Dad! What is that! Whats going on! How should I know! I had no idea what was going on when you came flying in! And I still dont know whats going on! What do you mean you dont know! Youre the one whos been fighting him! Stop complaining! If you want to know, ask Aizen yourself, you pain in the ass! Honestly The Hogyoku is very aptly named! It has the power to destroy the wall that separates those who are gods from those who arent! So youve come Kisuke Urahara! You and your father are so alike What Im nothing like this guy! No way! My son is nowhere near as good as me! See Thats what Im talking about Yeah, right! The Arrancar Encyclopedia Today Im going to talk about my Bankai, Kamishininoyari It can extend its blade up to 13 kilometers Thirteen kilometers is difficult to comprehend Its the size of about 39 Tokyo Towers For Yammy Id say about 260 Yammys Plus Whoa! If I ever forget anything, I can retrieve it as long as its within 13 kilometers of myself H-How convenient"

What What did you say youre going to do Its almost New Years movie season! Although the great Heisei recession, the so-called lost decade of the 90s, had come and gone, various financial crises occurred just as people thought that things were finally starting to look up As people tightened their wallets from spending, people sought low-cost entertainment and began flocking to movie theaters on their long vacations and spent their money there! It behooves us not to get left behind by that trend! Are the Thirteen Court Guard Squads that short on funds From what I heard, there apparently were considerable expenditures to repair the damage to Seireitei caused by repeated emergencies Thats because nobody thinks about the damage to their surroundings when they fight And so we have decided to hold a Seireitei International Film Festival, celebrating the release of Bleach Movie 4!

Are we pulling off the Produced with full cooperation from the famous tactic Yeah So what do you think, Ichigo Doesnt it make you excited! Whats the matter, Ichigo Theres something wrong about this whole film What do you mean I mean, why am I the only one whos getting beaten up! The explosions are too powerful, the attacks are precise, and I get shoved down from crazy places without warning! You did some great acting in every one of those scenes! I wasnt acting! And besides, I dont have a clue as to what the story of this film is to begin with! Who cares Were going to cut and paste during the editing stage anyway! When it comes down to it, we can just erase the sound and dub over it, and we can do anything we want with CG and music I knew it! Youre not putting any thought into this! I think thats fine Focusing too much on the script could cause problems Take Shuheis group for example They still havent finished the script yet, and now they are way behind schedule Hinamori is so pissed off You dont want to end up like them Wow, that sounds rough When the script is late, its the crew on the scene that suffers Muh! Thats not my concern! Byakuya! Your aim is too accurate! Do you have a grudge against me, or something Not at all Its just that I decided it was necessary in the pursuit of reality How noble of you, Brother! Were letting our names be credited in this film By the Kuchiki Clans honor, I cannot allow any mistakes to be made Aargh! Forget it! Im quitting! What But Kurosaki, weve come this far into the filming Sorry Inoue, I cant do this anymore Whatd you do that for! Whatre you afraid of! So you got beat up during filming Youre letting yourself get discouraged by something so trivial Youre not confident about looking good on camera Or are you afraid of getting beaten up in the pursuit of reality If you dont have confidence in your acting, make up for it with passion If youre not confident about making it look real, think up some way to fake it If youre afraid of the schedule pressing down on you, do all your scenes in one take Even if no one else believes in you, hold your head up high and shout out your lines! Thats the man I know you as, Ichigo! You talk too much! Okay! Lets start filming again! Is everyone ready Yeah! What are you people doing here Crap! They found us! Huh What do you mean, Renji Never mind Pack it up everybody! Hey, you didnt get a permit to film here! Of course not! What! I thought it would be easier to just do a guerrilla filming than go through the hassle of getting permission Intruders! Get them! Were surrounded! No! Roar! Zabimaru! This way! Hurry! Hey! Wait, Renji! Kurosaki! Hurry! Hurry! Dont let them get away! What is this place How would I know! Hey, its a dead end! No choice Bankai! Hihio Zabimaru! All right! Just as I planned it! Thats going too far Damn! They headed us off How is this just as you planned it! Theyre coming from behind too! Captain By the Kuchiki Clans honor, I wont allow myself to be captured here Your honor disappeared the moment you got involved with this film Wait, Byakuya! Whatre you going to do! Bankai Senbonzakura Kageyoshi Run! He did it! And so peace returns to the Soul Society thanks to the Written by: Renji Abarai efforts of young Ichigo Kurosaki, who blew himself up Maid Cop: Rukia Kuchiki   Lovely Criminal: Rangiku Matsumoto  Finally, wed like to add that this story is a work of fiction and is not associated with any actual location Special Effects: Byakuya Kuchiki Camera: Uryu Ishida  Gofer: Yasutora Sado Thank you for your support everyone Directed by: Renji Abarai Okay! It looks great! Im calling it Close Call for the Soul Society! The Film Festival Grand Prix is as good as mine! I knew I shouldnt have done this! Theres a grand prix for this film festival, right Its been cancelled Why! The Seireitei was destroyed during filming Therefore, the grand prix money was used for the repairs instead But that was all your fault The Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! Were making a movie too! How stupid! Count me out! Oh And here I was going to make you the star, Hiyori If thats the case, then I might consider it What the hell is this! Im calling it Great Monster Hiyora! You damn baldy!"
" No! Calm down! Im a Soul Reaper Are you all right What happened With all these missing Soul Reaper incidents going on Are you sure you want to do this, Kuchiki Going out without a gigai If something happens to you, dont say I didnt warn you Then dont make me transport your merchandise for you! Boy, youve been such a huge help Thanks to these recent incidents, I cant use my usual route anymore That put me in a real bind That explains why theres so much here Right now, Im willing to give you some good deals! No thanks! Boss! Were all ready to go, sir! Okay Im done here as well Ready to go Were about to leave on our Uraharas Shop employee vacation! Well, you see, we had nothing to do because we were sold out of merchandise, so I planned a vacation But now that we have all this merchandise We should get right to work! I guess well go on that vacation, after all R-Right Now if youll excuse us, well be on our way Kuchiki I went around to several of the places where the incidents occurred There was evidence that the Soul Reapers were attacked and probably eaten I see Then they were attacked by Hollows No, they werent At the sites, there was absolutely no residual Spiritual Pressure from Hollows However Had enough, Soul Reaper Tsk! Youre pathetic I dont even feel like eating a Soul Reaper like you Dance Sodenoshirayuki! Somenomai Tsukishiro! So it was targeting Soul Reapers, after all Phew Im saved I know you You remember me! Indeed! I am the one, the only, Soul Reaper in charge of Karakura Town! Zennosuke Kurumadani! This is the guy who took over for me Thishas no effect on me! What is this Spiritual Pressure Its just as Urahara said Its different in some way from that of a Hollow Youre Ive found you! Hado Number 33: Sokatsui! That technique Im sure of it! I knew if I went on a rampage in this town, youd appear And I was right! You know me! What You dont remember Its me! Me! See Y-Youre Shrieker! Correct You cant be! Thats not possible I thought you fell into the depths of Hell! A Zanpakuto can only wash away sins committed after ones death But for Hollows who committed major sins when they were still humans, Hell will open its gates! You! How did you get out of Hell How Im not going to tell you that! Get her! I wont fall for the same trick twice! Oh Nice moves Though I dont recall you being that good Dont underestimate me! I had simply lost my powers back then! I will assist you! Fool! Dont! What! Ill start with you! No way! Stay here! Ive been waiting for you! Here! Im going to make it a painful death! This cant be His power and speed are at an entirely different level! What! Now Ive got you! A chain This chain cant be cut by the likes of you! Die! Too slow! Somenomai Tsukishiro! That takes care of his clones What! How is that possible I didnt sense the presence of any of his clones Where did those bombs come from Whats the matter Arent you going to run away Good morning, Tsuchinamazu! What! This is Nows our chance to get away! Th-That was an escape technique What! Kurumadani! He has leech bombs in his body, as well! My entire body is like a bomb! Damn! Hurry Get away Hey! Im different from the way I was back then! Whatare you! You dont know what this chain is This chain is from Hell And I am a Sinner of Hell! Sinner! That cant be! Theres no way a Sinner could escape from Hell But I did! To get my revenge on you! What just happened! What are you doing Shut up! Renji! Are you all right, Rukia Why are you here We got a report from the Department of Research and Development about some weird Spiritual Pressure being detected in the World of the Living What the hell is this guy Hes a Sinner of Hell A Sinner Youre kidding Bastard! Dont interfere when things were just getting good! Dont get so carried away! One Soul Reaper down! Bankai! Hihio Zabimaru! Hikotsu Taiho! That wont be enough to kill me! Ill keep returning from the depths of Hell! What the hell just happened I dont know But We will now begin the emergency Captains Meeting! Captains Zaraki and Kurotsuchi dont seem to be here yet Never mind them I summoned you all here on short notice Fill in the absent captains with the details later Now then, we received word a short while ago that a Sinner of Hell appeared in the World of the Living Sinner of Hell Sinner Thats a reference to a resident of Hell, right The souls of people who die are sent to the Soul Society, the home of souls However, souls of people who committed heinous acts during their lifetimes are unable to enter the Soul Society and are instead plunged into Hell Then As Sinners, they are tied in chains and condemned for all eternity for their sins This is the first time in the history of the Soul Society that a Sinner, a resident of Hell, has found his way back into the World of the Living Does it mean something is amiss in Hell How could that be Theres the gatekeeper in Hell called Kushanaada, whose control is absolute Yes However, Ive heard that there are powerful beings with mysterious powers who make their home deep in the bowels of Hell If they are able to freely find their way into the World of the Living, weve got a bit of a problem The situation is grave We will start by dispatching Renji Abarai and Rukia Kuchiki, who first encountered the Sinner, as advance troops to the World of the Living! In the event the need arises, I will provide them with procedures to infiltrate Hell and to make an emergency return Shall we request the assistance of Substitute Soul Reaper Ichigo Kurosaki, as well No, we mustnt Give strict orders to both Abarai and Kuchiki that they are not to involve the Substitute Soul Reaper under any circumstances! Szayelaporro Oh, its you, Aaroniero I noticed there was another person falling along side of me But it was you I have to say thats one tough cylinder Were you hoping it would break No Im saying that if it had cracked, I could open it up and investigate the liquid inside You bastard! I dont know what this place is, but its convenient that Lord Aizen isnt here! You can live on inside me after my Glotoneria eats you! Wait! You just said it I dont know what this place is Right now, shouldnt we investigate where we are, rather than kill each other I dont really care either way I can investigate that after I kill you You dont seem to comprehend the difference in our powers I am Espada Number 8, and you are 9 Youll lose What! You two are funny What is this place If you want to know, Ill tell you This is Hell Who are you Why dont you come down and talk You guys are hilarious I told you This is Hell The two of you are already dead What kind of nonsense is that! I see Thank you for jogging my memory It appears I did die Because of that damned despicable Soul Reaper While Im at it, let me ask you Is there a way to get out of this place you call Hell and return to Hueco Mundo Of course not Really If there is a way, its better if you didnt keep it from us I am Shuren Do you know The only way to survive here in Hell is to do as I say What! Taikon Gunjo Garogai Our guests appear dissatisfied with Hell Please teach them to appreciate it Aaroniero! A Gran Rey Cero, eh This is the power of an Espadas Cero How disappointing I have no more use for you Dont get so cocky, Sinner! Their level of power was nowhere near enough to open it Gunjo, what about the man we sent to the World of the Living Yes, sir! He returned safely He was no longer of use, so I silenced him The experiment was a success I see Our dark days are about to come to an end As I suspected, it looks like it has to be you I will bring you down, Ichigo Kurosaki Im glad youre safe, Rukia Thank you for your help, Renji Now let us return to the Soul Society Right Im glad no one else got hurt besides us Yes Lets just hope nothing else happens Kurumadani Ze- The Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! Lets have fun in Hawaii! Lets have a blast using the money we put away and saved! Yes Well enjoy the beach and shopping This is everything Huh What is this cat Whered it come from Hey, Kisuke! Whats going on! And here I thought we could save on Yoruichis airfare"
" Hado Number 91: Senjukotentaiho! Wh-What the hellis that! Here I go This time, Im not holding back Bankai Kamishininoyari Whats wrong Youre getting slower Are you already at your limit Yes, it seems like it Ive reached my limit My limit as a Soul Reaper, that is You stopped that well Thats pretty good for sheer luck Who are you calling lucky, stupid! Sorry, Captain Aizen Did I interrupt your conversation Its all right I just finished talking Honestly The Hogyoku is very aptly named! It has the power to destroy the wall that separates those who are gods from those who arent! So youve come Kisuke Urahara! Urahara Its been a while, Aizen Yes, around a hundred years In the time I havent seen you Youve taken up some interesting fashion Everything in the process of evolving looks ugly Who said anything about ugly You fused yourself with the Hogyoku, havent you Not fused Id rather you said subjugated The Hogyoku you could not control Youre right, I couldnt control it At that time At that time That is some excuse you have Though whether youre trying to make an excuse or not means nothing to me Because Urahara! You have already lost your chance to control the Hogyoku Rikujokoro! Come to think of it, Yammys battle records did list such an item Ill tell you! That was called a Bala! We solidify our Spiritual Pressure and hit the enemy with it! Its not as strong as a Cero But its twenty times faster! Lord Aizens going to be furious! You bastard! Why Why am I still alive The answer isthis Wha-- Its a portable gigai! I let my guard down, figuring youd never resort to such trickery So, what do you plan to do now after tying me up with such a weak Bakudo Such a weak Bakudo Then lets see how many you can take Bakudo Number 63 Sajosabaku! Bakudo Number 79 Kuyoshibari! Beyond the end of a thousand hands The hand of darkness out of reach The archer in heaven that goes unseen Road that lights the way Wind that ignites the embers Gather without hesitation Look where I point Bullets of light, bodies of eight, rays of nine, paths of heaven, treasures of speed, wheels of immensity, and cannons of grey From a distance, the bow is drawn and fades in light Do you think Id let you use such a Kido I can easily break free of Too late! Hado Number 91: Senjukotentaiho! Incredible Aizen It would appear you really did lower your guard when you embedded the Hogyoku Exactly Too slow I did lower my guard There is no longer any need to be on guard I can feel it Even when I was in the Soul Society, no one could compare to my powers But now that I have subjugated the Hogyoku, my body has surpassed even that There is no longer any need to dodge a Kido at the nineties level Youve got it wrong Not dodging my Kido isnt what I meant when I said you let your guard down The old you would never have attempted to attack me twice without thinking This is Its a seal Ive sealed the outlets for Spiritual Pressure that are on the wrists of every Soul Reaper You will be incinerated from the inside by your own Spiritual Pressure Urahara! Its not over yet Huh It would be childs play if that were all it took to finish him We could laugh him off as a mere monster Hell be coming out in no time Wh-What the hellis that! You used a nineties-level Kido as a decoy to lure me into attacking, and you used a spell you developed to incinerate me from the inside If I hadnt been your opponent No, if it hadnt been me who subjugated the Hogyoku, the battle would probably have been over But unfortunately, the Hogyoku you created exceeds your ability to understand it Even this technique you created in anticipation of battling me, has no effect on me Your spell didnt work, so now youre coming at me with your sword As you wish What nonsense is this Do you really think Youre Yoruichi! Well Did that work Yoruichi, get out of the way! Tsk! Whats the matter Youre not done already, are you Youd better make your next move quickly I will crush them one at a time, down to your last remaining one The number of methods you contrived to defeat me is proof of your effort and strength At the same time, it represents the number of hopes you hold If that is so, then what I must do is to crush each one of them Now, come at me with your next attack Kisuke Urahara Yoruichi Shihoin And Isshin Kurosaki Well, this is a problem That was specially made iron armor for use against Hierro I didnt think itd be destroyed so easily Huh What You make it sound like it was my fault No, I didnt mean it that way Oh yes you did! Youre trying to say its my fault for letting my guard down! Arent you! Well listen up You didnt put in enough effort when you made these! Which means its all your fault for being lazy during their construction! Okay, okay, I get it! I see The fact that your leg still remains intact after being hit by me proves they are special You mean my legs Whats with that look! My nose hurts! Theres no need to make a scene Its meaningless to argue what is special If a single swing makes one disappear, then three more swings will make that specialness disappear Here he comes I know Are you good to go Who do you think youre talking to All I have to do is hit him with something other than my left leg Yoruichi! Pay attention Your back is wide open Psych! Just messing with you How about we take a break for a second W-Whatre you talking about Oh, come on Lets watch the show Its useless Im telling you, its useless Its useless now Ive been with Captain Aizen a long time, but Ive never seen anything like this Well, he fused with the Hogyoku without my knowing, so maybe thats to be expected Dont you get it Theres nothing you can do Hes going to kill all of you Its all over Im not letting that happen Yeah, thats what I thought youd say And theres no telling what Aizen would do to you, now that hes like that! Oh my, now I wasnt expecting you to say that The way you said it Sounds like you said it assuming youd die Maybe somewhere inside of you, youve already given up on this fight Thats not My, my How pathetic I was hoping youd be better than that, but I guess you really are just a kid Youre weak inside I couldnt possibly let Captain Aizen fight a coward like you What is that stance! Kamishininoyari Buto Its already back in place! Kamishininoyari Butorenjin CaptainIchimaru Matsumoto Gin Way too soft Ill be the one wholl stop you! Well have to resort to our final plan! You still had one left Off with all the armors! Huh And last goes the clothes I call it, Operation: Sex Appeal! Put your clothes back on! Whats this Looks like it had an effect on my ally instead Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers What is this old album Memory Album It was left in the captains meeting room earlier Lets have a look This is Hey, this brings back memories This is about a century ago Everyone was so young Old Man Yama hasnt changed much This ones back when we were in the Academy How many centuries ago was that Sensei was young back then He looks exactly the same! How long has he been like that!"
" Shunko! If you aint gonna run, I will kill you right here, right now Whats the matter Youre not done already, are you Youd better make your next move quickly I will crush them one at a time, down to your last remaining one The number of methods you contrived to defeat me is proof of your effort and strength At the same time, it represents the number of hopes you hold If that is so, then what I must do is to crush each one of them Now, come at me with your next attack Its meaningless to argue what is special If a single swing makes one disappear, then three more swings will make that specialness disappear Yoruichi! Pay attention Your back is wide open Psych! Just messing with you Maybe somewhere inside of you, youve already given up on this fight Thats not My, my How pathetic I was hoping youd be better than that, but I guess you really are just a kid Youre weak inside I couldnt possibly let Captain Aizen fight a coward like you What is that stance! Kamishininoyari Buto Its already back in place! Kamishininoyari Butorenjin You leave me no choice Its that range That Zanpakutos greatest strength is that it can attack with any timing, regardless of the distance between itself and its opponent And it also acts as a defense, preventing the opponent from attacking If I could only get inside his space, I should be able to break through! You seem to be thinking something up, but I think its useless Hey Not bad So close I guess thats all youve got You probably thought you might be able to do something by unleashing a Hollowfied Getsugatensho after getting inside my Shinsos range, but you dont seem to understand yet That cant be You were able to stop my attack with your Zanpakuto, so why didnt you consider that I could do the same thing against your attack What wishful thinking You saw no need to even move You seriously underestimate us Is this a good idea Too bad You failed to strike a decisive blow That is, of course, assuming your decisive attacks are enough to critically wound me Captain Ichimaru Matsumoto! Matsumoto! Thats reckless I could only heal you to the point of barely keeping you alive Im not done healing you yet Matsumoto How pathetic Were you this weak Even your mask is so fragile Is that the best a Hollowfication could do At least back then You were more frightening Oh well You, get out of here What! Are you all right Like I said, who do you think youre speaking to! I was wearing your half-assed protective gear, so I tried to block him If hadnt been wearing it, I wouldve dodged normally and been uninjured! Well, excuse me Whatre you looking at You Im watching you, thinking that your feigned sense of concern is part of your strategy I thought you decided not to be on guard Im not Im observing In the Soul Society, you were the only one with a mind that exceeded my own Even if our strengths are no longer equal, I find you interesting You overestimate me Nowadays, Im just a mere small-time candy shop owner Hado Number 32: Oukasen! You should know that Kido at the thirties level have no meaning at all The fact that you used it means As expected You appear to enjoy using the same tactic Dont you get it You cant defeat me with your blows, no matter how many thousands you hit me with Shunko! I said, you cant defeat me Shibari Benihime! Did you really think you could bind me with this Hiasobi Benihime Juzutsunagi! Dont make me laugh Is this the best you can do Do you think this will Getsuga Tensho! Hows it look I dont know After taking that form, his Spiritual Pressure has become completely unreadable I know hes frighteningly powerful, but when we fight him or slash at him, it feels like theres nothing there Its creepy Its likely only those who are at the same level as Aizen can feel his current power That was a fine sword attack I now understand that attack, as well What is that in there Whats going on I think its time you understood my powers Is it all right to turn around when Im right in front of you Looks like Getsuga Tensho has reached its limit It didnt work on me, and neither did it work on Captain Aizen, who was hit directly He doesnt even look damaged at all Theres nothing more you can do Hollowfication and Getsuga Tensho Neither of them worked, so its hopeless Things might be different, though, if you still have something up your sleeve, but You dont, do you And besides, youre no longer a warrior Youre not a Soul Reaper Nor are you a Hollow, or a human being Here, in your ambiguous condition, do you think you can win against an opponent to whom those three lost For your own good Get out of here You dont want to die yet, do you Im not interested in you anymore Captain Aizen would probably be disappointed in you the way you are now Youre afraid of Captain Aizen, arent you Youre able to understand how strong Captain Aizen is, arent you That was your last warning If you still wont get out of here I will kill you right here, right now Dad Urahara Yoruichi! Dad Urahara Yoruichi! Gin What were you about to do to him Just a small test of his strength I see Open the Senkaimon We will head to Karakura Town in the Soul Society There wont be any need to destroy the Tenkaiketchu If we are to take down the palace, it would be to our advantage to create the Ouken in the Soul Society Yes W-Wait! Captain Aizen Oh It seems Im at the end of the Chrysalis Stage Thank goodness I will be able to witness the end of the Soul Society with my own eyes Unlock I will leave you here You shall be devoured when everything has ended Whats happening Whats Ichigo! Whatre you just standing there for Open the Senkaimon! Dad! The Precipice World It feels so nostalgic It truly does The Cleaner This isnt good Lets go, Captain Aizen Captain Aizen, we should go quickly That thing exists on the side of reason, rather than Spiritual Pressure Its not something you can deal with using Spiritual Pressure Captain Aizen What are you afraid of, Gin Reason exists for those who must rely on reason to survive Well, shall we get going Towards the end of all reason Dad Lets go Were going to protect Karakura Town Huh Didnt you hear me! I said were going to protect Karakura Town! Theres no way Theres just no way We dont know if its impossible! I know! And you know too, Dad! Theres no way we can beat a monster with that kind of Spiritual Pressure! I see Just as I thought, you do understand that guys Spiritual Pressure Huh Lets go Arent you coming If youre not coming, whatre you going to do Are you going to cry Are you going to sit there and cry because you couldnt protect something again! Think hard about what it means for Aizen to be heading to Soul Society Unless you go, it means that everyone, the people you want to protect, and the others who are in Karakura Town is all going to die at Aizens hands Dad Open the Senkaimon Karakura Town is that way You were a bit off Mind not making it sound like its my fault It was your childs play that threw us off from our original destination, Captain Aizen Yes, youre right Sorry about that Shall we take a little walk Wait! Ichigo! What! Werent we in a hurry! Somethings odd Theres no sign of the Cleaner Cleaner You mean that Spiritual Pressure train-like thing Yeah Ordinarily, a Soul Reaper cant do anything about the Cleaner From the traces of Spiritual Pressure, it appears Aizen did something Is it bad if that thing is gone If we leave things like this, its not good But Right now, its to our advantage What This Precipice World, as the name suggests, is a place isolated temporally and spatially from both the World of the Living and the Soul Society The Cleaner existed to keep those who entered here from staying a long time But right now, its gone Ill be able to teach you in this place Teach me What The Final Getsugatensho! The Final Getsugatensho Why was I sleeping here What do you mean by the Final Getsugatensho Hey, answer me! Hold on a second I got a little carried away while saying it Im trying to come up with what it is right now! Dad, you bastard! Wait! I lied! Dont worry, Ill teach you! There you go again with your ranting Dont hit your dad! Stop, youll kill me! Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! The title is Cell Phones Hello Its me I told you not to do it Shut up"
" Zangetsu! Are you Zangetsu! No, I am Wh-What the hell is this! Wait! Ichigo! What! Werent we in a hurry! Somethings odd Theres no sign of the Cleaner Cleaner You mean that Spiritual Pressure train-like thing Yeah Ordinarily, a Soul Reaper cant do anything about the Cleaner From the traces of Spiritual Pressure, it appears Aizen did something What are you afraid of, Gin Reason exists for those who must rely on it to survive Well, shall we get going Towards the end of all reason Is it bad if that thing is gone If we leave things like this, its not good But Right now, its to our advantage What This Precipice World, as the name suggests, is a place isolated temporally and spatially from both the World of the Living and the Soul Society The Cleaner existed to keep those who entered here from staying a long time But right now, its gone Ill be able to teach you in this place Teach me What The Final Getsugatensho! The Final Getsugatensho Why was I sleeping here The FinalGetsugatensho Thats correct And this is where you could teach me Whys that The Precipice World is a rupture in space surrounded by multiple layers of temporal torrents I see You dont have to know what it means Put simply, time flows at a much faster rate than in the outside world Expressed in numbers, its 2000 times as fast In the time that a year passes on the outside, 2000 years will have passed here in the Precipice World What! Long ago, besides being the pathway to the World of the Living, this Precipice World was also used as an exile for criminals Thats why the Restrictive Current and the Cleaner exist If the Restrictive Current captures you, then you would be unable to escape the Precipice World and die If the Cleaner pursues you,  then you would be hurled to a time greatly different  than the temporal coordinates at which you entered the Precipice World That is why there was a variance of several days when you first entered the Soul Society after being pursued by the Cleaner Anyway, you have Uraharas technical skills to thank for getting off with only a few days variance after the Cleaner pursued you Ordinarily, you wouldve been hurled about a century and died from your body being unable to keep up with the sudden passage of time But right now, that Cleaner is not here This is a good opportunity to gain some time The flow of time within the Precipice World is  2000 times that of the outside In other words, even if you trained 2000 hours here,  only one hour will have gone by on the outside There is no means of sealing the Cleaner in the Soul Society, but there is a way to stop the Restrictive Current We call it Realm Fixation Normally, its done by having a group of low-ranking Soul Reapers pool their Spiritual Pressure to fixate the Restrictive Current But I can perform it by myself I will hold down the Restrictive Current until my Spiritual Pressure is exhausted By my rough estimate, thatll be 2000 hours Or about 3 months Use that time to get an answer Answer Thats right You need to find out Get your sword, Zangetsu, to tell you about the Final Getsugatensho! WhatWhat happened Whats going on Everybodys asleep on the streets All the cars and traffic lights have stopped This is not cool! Why does it look like the world has come to an end! This isnt a dream And it isnt a movie, either Come on! Isnt anybody awake! Hey! Everybody! Mizuiro! Ichigo! Sis! Dont leave me here alone! That hurt! Whats the big Huh Arisawa! Oh, thank goodness! Im so glad to see someone, even if its you! I mean Did you take a look around Everyones all sound asleep! I was getting lonely, thinking maybe I was the only one still awake in the world! I mean, no ones waking up It feels so real and creepy, you know I wouldve been able to handle all this if it was just me here, but this is way too freaky But I sure am glad youre alive! Not that I was worried about you! In fact, Id rather you worried about me! By the way, have you seen Mizuiro I havent yet! Hey, come to think of it Whyd you lariat me, huh! Shut up Right Sorry Whyd you dodge Are you crazy! If I dont dodge, its gonna hurt! The fact that you dodged my fist means you arent putting your soul into your sword! Concentrate! Dont you even know how to talk with your own Zanpakuto! I get it, ok But Ive never turned to Old Man Zangetsu outside of battle like this Place your sword on your lap and meditate! Concentrate your soul on only your sword! Thats all there is to it! I get that, but That form is called Jinzen It is a form for carrying on a dialogue with ones Zanpakuto that was devised over the course of thousands of years since the beginning of the Soul Society Ichigo, up until now, all your techniques were acquired through brute force Do you understand For you to progress further, you must venture into realms of millennia you never touched on before GoIchigo! Im really sorry How should I put it Im by myself, and everyones asleep, and I was lonely, and it was so quiet, and no ones awake, and And then I got hyper, you know Will you stop with the noisy excuses Enough already! Come over here! No, Im serious Im really sorry Honsho! Ogawa! I found them For now, Im taking them to the school Can you carry Chizuru Right! Up you go! You better not touch her butt! I know that! Say, Arisawa What Honshos got bigger boobs than I thought Heres what I know so far I went to take a look around earlier, but the town was cut off right at the outskirts There were only mountains past that Its hard to believe, but the entire town has been moved Do you think Ichigo has something to do with this Isnt it obvious Who else is there! But If it was Ichigos fault, then Ichigo is going to fix it Thats the kind of guy he is Indeed A sight unfitting for the Soul Society This is the last well see of it Calm down How unsightly of you You should be able to breathe Well Who are you Old Man Zangetsu is the only one who should be here Is that any way to talk to the person who taught you how to breathe Tensa Zangetsu! I cant blame you for not recognizing me This is the first time youve come here in a Bankai state What! Zangetsu! Are you Zangetsu! Wrong What do you call your Bankai I am Tensa Zangetsu Youve entered Be careful, now This time, Zangetsu will not go easy on you It was the same with my Engetsu Our Zanpakutos dont want to teach us this technique Youll learn why soon enough W-Wait, Old Man I mean, youre not old right now, but Wait, Zangetsu! This time Im not here to fight! I just need an answer! Answer You mean about the Final Getsugatensho Thats Wait a second So you can hear whats said outside What are you doing! I cant teach you such a thing Oh, is that so Unfortunately, I need you to teach me So what The fate of what you want to protect is none of my concern What Dont misunderstand, Ichigo What you want to protect is not what I want to protect My head hurts What is going on The trains arent running I cant get to the office, or even go home Hey, you there! Im glad someone is awake Do you have any idea of what is going on here Dont come near me A human with no awareness of Spiritual Pressure is unable to sense my power But their body cant withstand it Oh Those kids over there seem to be awake Yes I recall seeing them through Ulquiorras eyes They are Ichigo Kurosakis friends What do you mean About what You said earlier The fate of what you want to protect is none of my concern Im asking what you meant by that! I thought you lent me your power to help me Was I wrong Then why did you lend me your power all this time What were you planning Answer me, Zangetsu! Its exactly as I said What! Look at this world! This world of yours used to be filled with skyscrapers, full of hope! Now it has sunken low to look like the small town thats dear to you! The rain that continued to fall on this world has subsided, but in its place, everything has sunk into this ocean! This all happened, Ichigo, because you lost hope and stopped moving forward! Ichigo I cannot leave you like this I will drag out the root of your despair right here and now! Whats up Its been a long time, Ichigo Whats with that look Dont you recognize me Come to think of it Huh Arent you going to look for Kojima Well I did try looking for him But ever since Ichigo disappeared, hes been going to school on his own And he hasnt answered his cell phone either So hes probably still asleep somewhere You two have been hanging out since middle school, so I thought you were best friends I guess its not like that, huh We have our personal spaces People need that, right You think so Ichigo was the first person Mizuiro ever opened up to He tends to put up a wall very quickly, so it makes me happy just to see him walk up to people on his own Lets stop this What am I saying, anyway You were telling cheesy stories Why you Anyway, after we drop off Chizuru and Michiru at the school, go and find Kojima What about Kunieda and Natsui Those two can manage by themselves Ill go look for Yuzu and Karin Isnt their Dad with them That guys probably unconscious with the rest of them W-What the hell is this! A-Arisawa Are you all right! Shut up I dont need you to worry about me Who are those guys Arisawa! Impressive Youre this close to me, yet you are still able to maintain your existence Whoare you Ichigo Kurosaki will show up here for sure With new powers, no doubt I want to bring those powers closer to perfection Your deaths will help that cause Run, Asano! Huh Get going! Or is there something you can do here! Dont bother chasing after him Ill start with this one first Whatll I do Whatll I do My body wont move Whatll I do What should I do!  Arisawa, ever heard of a misattribution of arousal What are you babbling about at a time like this When youre in an agitating situation with someone for some reason, your brain misattributes it as love Oh really So youre in love with that freak in white Sorry I told you to run How did you come to that conclusion! Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! Hey! Hurry up and return this place to the way it used to be! It doesnt appear all that inconvenient Why not leave it like this No, it is! Everything mechanical has become unusable Once you fall asleep, theres no telling where youll end up Ive tried equipping myself with all sorts of things, but its really a hassle! You look like youre having fun! He sure looks like hes having fun"

Now see here, Renji! Sea bream holds a special place in the New Years feast Long ago, they talked of staring at the sea bream, where no one touched the sea bream for the first three days of the New Year There is literature that describes how, even today, the custom of not eating sea bream on New Years day still remains Okay, okay, I hear you Renji!

" Success! We did it, Karin! My name is Franken Ichigo I was on the brink of death after battling Hollows, but I have been brought back to life as an android I wandered aimlessly about, and as I emerged from the dark forest, there was a castle Where…is this place What the heck is this Not again Ichigo! Oh, Rukiruki! Huh One night, I had a dream I awoke in a desert to find I had become an Arabian thief and… Ah, forget it The point is that this whole thing is a dream Are you daydreaming or something What’re you talking about What difference does it make when I’m already inside a dream Ouch! Hey, that hurt! You’re not dreaming! It was time for our meeting, but you never showed up, so I came to get you! Meeting You fool! Ouch! Have you forgotten about that too, you moron! Ow ow ow! Hey, cut that out! Come on, we’re going back to the castle! Okay! I get it, so stop that! Rukiruki! It’s not Rukiruki! I’m Rukia! Stop… Ow! We’re back! Rangiku, Toshiro, Ishida, Inoue and… Who are you Wait… Relax, relax This is a dream A dream What’re you mumbling to yourself about Hurry up and take your seat! Oh Right, right Ishida, what’s that you’re drinking Can’t you tell It’s milk Why aren’t you drinking blood! Aren’t you Dracula! What’re you talking about Blood is the same color as a Soul Reaper’s Spirit Ribbon I would never drink that But, why milk As both Dracula and a Quincy, it is only natural that I take pride in the color white! Hey, what’s wrong, Ishida! The truth is, I’m a bit anemic because I can’t drink blood Mind not getting me so worked up Is this guy okay He’s fine It happens all the time, right Right Rangiku is a witch, and Inoue is a… Is that a pumpkin A pumpkin ghost Kurosaki, you’re all patched together! So weird! You’re the weird one, Inoue Sorry about that, Inoue He’s been acting strange since I brought him here I’m fine! By the way, what kind of monster are you supposed to be dressed up as What Can’t you tell I’m a succubus Huh What’s a succubus Allow me to explain! Succubi are generally known as “dream demons” They are a kind of demon that ruin men, appearing as lovely women with bat wings on their backs They attack men in their sleep, seduce them, and suck them of their life energy Hey Rukia You’ve been jabbing at me with that fork this whole time Don’t tell me you’re… Fool! Why would I seduce you! I display my skills as a seductress only to those who are noble and beautiful For example… Someone like my older brother Jeez… Enough with all of this! Uh… That voice… Is that you, Renji I couldn’t tell who you were with that mummy outfit Wrong Huh I’m not a mummy I’m a pirate What I was once a pirate who sailed the seven seas Back then, I was afraid of nothing I believed the world was my oyster But my arch enemy, Team Seaweed, stood before me Get them! Pine! Go, seaweeds! Seaweed, seaweed! A fierce cannon fight ensued between our two pirate ships And finally… Shall I tell you the difference between you and I It’s class The wounds from that day made me end up like this Wait So you’re not a monster And Team Seaweed What the hell Hey, you guys! Weren’t we here to have a meeting! Meeting What are you talking about, Toshiro I’m not Toshiro! I’m Wolfman Hitsugaya! We couldn’t start the meeting because you didn’t come! Oh, that’s all right, Captain We haven’t all introduced ourselves yet, and the meeting is only about the hunters anyway, right Hunters All we have to do is get rid of the hunters quickly Don’t get so stressed out Your fur will start falling out again, Captain Matsumoto! Don’t get angry! Here, use this to ease your stress! Fetch! Wow, Captain! Good boy, good boy! I’m not a dog! Shake! Good job! I said I’m not a dog! Here, one more time! Fetch! So what’s the deal with this meeting and the “hunters” If you insist… I guess I’ll have to explain So we’re back to you again We received information that recently, mysterious monster hunters have been showing up in this area For reasons unknown, the two of them are not killing monsters but they are looking for a certain secret treasure Secret treasure That’s right The secret treasure they are searching for is a legendary jewel that will force us monsters to turn back into human beings, the Snow Crystal! Wait just a minute… I recognize that shape! Yes They plan to use the Snow Crystal to cleanse the world of every last monster That is their objective Question! Where is that whatever-you-called-it crystal It is kept under lock and key here in the top floor of this castle So by using that, we all turn back into human beings That is correct That is why we absolutely must protect the Snow Crystal from them Stop! Where are you going, Kurosaki Where To the top floor Hey, Kurosaki! Surely you’re not planning to… Damn right! I’m using that jewel to return to being a human being! Then I should be able to wake up from this dream! What kind of nonsense is that! Come to your senses! Blood…not enough blood Once you wake up from this dream, your anemia will be gone too! See you! - Everyone! We have a situation! - Ouch! Look! The sky is… That’s… - Dad - Ryuken! Ah! Dad! Ryuken! Kurosaki, you first No, you go ahead first Fine, then Ahem Ryuken! Calling your father by his first name… You haven’t changed at all Why do you have the powers of a monster hunter You are such a fool Ryuken Ishida… Whether I like it or not, I am the only man who is allowed to call himself the last monster hunter Um… There’s also me, you know Just shut up and get going! Now then! Prepare yourself, Uryu! You leave me no choice but to fight you Kuchiki, Inoue, Hinamori, return to the castle and protect the crystal! Right! The rest of us will stop the hunters here! Huh Where’s Kurosaki Oh, crap! Like I would waste my time fighting hunters! I’m going to get the Snow Crystal and wake up from this dream! Dad… So you’ve come, Son I’m not letting you go a step further! Huh Hey, wait! Didn’t you guys come to steal the Snow Crystal from us! Never mind the details! What is this! You’re not making any sense! I’ll defeat you and return to reality! It’s useless to resist, Uryu I know you don’t have the energy to shoot a volley of arrows D-Damn it! If only I had drunk blood like I should have And also, you probably think that the maximum number of Spirit Arrows I can shoot in a volley is 1200, but… Actually, it’s twelve hundred…and one! What! Extend, Zabiobi! Hey! Let me help you out, Ishida! Damn! All I want is to wake up from this dream! Why do I have to fight you, Dad! Sour grapes You’re being a poor sport, Ichigo! As the saying goes, “The lion, the King of Beasts, shoves its cubs off the highest cliff to test their worthiness” Now, Ichigo! Crawl back up and prove that you’ve surpassed me! Like I said, stop talking nonsense! That’s no reason to fight, is it! Found you, Kurosaki! Bastard! How dare you betray us! You deceived us and planned to snatch the crystal, didn’t you! What No, wait, you don’t understand! I mean, look! I’m fighting a hunter right now! Huh Oh, so you’re having a family squabble Abarai! Ishida! My, my… You guys are all talk and no substance Damn! We can’t do a thing against him! If you absolutely refuse to tell me where the crystal is, then you leave me no choice I’ll get rid of you first, then take my time looking for it Hey, Ishida! Isn’t there anything we can do Now! Huh Huh What! Wh-What is this Hikotsu Houtai! Hey, what’s the big idea Stop it! Panpuru, Pinpuru, Hainekkon! Ban… kai! Daiurufu Hyorinmaru! I placed Sprenger inside the courtyard for such a situation Guess it paid off It’s over, monster hunters And as for you, Kurosaki… Your noble sacrifice allowed us to earn a victory Rest in peace Kurosaki! Ichigo! Are you all right, Kurosaki! Man, that was close If I didn’t have this mask, I’d have been a goner along with the hunters Hey, Ishida! What was up with that land mine! What’re you talking about I told everyone about it earlier today It’s your fault for not being there on time What Is that so That’s right! You’re so forgetful, Ichigo! Oh, I see! Sorry! Jokes over! Wh-What! Now you’ve done it Brats! You won’t get away with this! Pumpkin Pumpkin Pumpkin Will this do, Inoue Yes The barrier appears to have become much stronger now What’re we going to do There’s nowhere else to run! Damn! Guess we’ll have to fight them again Fight But we didn’t stand a chance! We have no choice It’s not worth everyone’s lives It’s regrettable, but we’ll have to hand the crystal over to them Inoue! Where is the crystal It’s right over there! Okay! Huh Hey, Ichigo! It’s no use I can’t hold them back any longer! This is as far as you go, you pathetic monsters Where’d you hide the crystal It would seem there’s a petty thief among you Which one of you is it It wasn’t me! I wouldn’t do such a thing! Kurosaki! It wasn’t me, either! Or me! Looks like you have your answer Nobody knows! Maybe such a thing never existed to begin with! What! These guys might be monsters, but it doesn’t change the fact that they’re my precious friends! I will protect them! Fool! Do you think you can beat us I’m not going to fight you just thinking I can win But I can’t have you hurt my friends any further! I have to win! Jeez… Reckless as always, aren’t you Ishida! Don’t get the wrong idea I’m not helping you This is my fight too, you know That’s good enough reason to join forces Let’s do it! Wh-What is this! Beating scum like you isn’t going to amount to much money That’s how it is Huh What’s that supposed to mean See you Hey you guys! Hurray! We won! Hurray! Hey! Friends, he said How impudent Aren’t you glad You got to see how much your precious son matured Whatever! You just won’t admit it, will you Hey, wait up! What the hell was that all about But where is the Snow Crystal That’s right! Without that, I can’t go back! Go back to what I’m out! Hey! Rukia! You hid it! What’re you talking about A succubus is a demon that shows you dreams In other words, I am the Snow Crystal! I don’t get it And besides, this isn’t your dream Then whose is it Ouch! What was that for! Kurosaki! What’s this Fur! Farewell, Ichigo Beast! A dream That was scary Oh, wait! It was my face! What a good episode to celebrate the series’ 10-year anniversary We got to see our son’s mature No it wasn’t Look at this outfit I wore it thinking it was my son’s design, but he hasn’t improved at all! Oh, I designed that I’m going to go change Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers We’re not done yet It’s to celebrate the 10-year anniversary We have to go all the way Whoa! Why the surprise You’re a monster, right Ishida, you bastard! Wait, that’s… Nothing happened Actually, it looks like we’re falling yet again Ah! There’s more of this!"
" I think I’ll go for a dip in the outdoor bath! Rangiku… I’m coming to be killed Drive it that way! We’ll drive it away from the town! Lieutenant! Were any of the townspeople injured No!

And why are you making lunch for the Women’s Soul Reaper Association, anyway That’s…because they depended on me What was I to do It’s not easy being a talented man I’ll bet you did it to get Matsumoto’s attention, didn’t you W-What are you talking about! Work isn’t something you do for its pros and cons Besides, if you do your best, there’ll always be someone who will take notice of you Is that how it works You sure it’s not just them taking advantage of you Oh, shut up Excuse me! Can we get another bottle Coming up! And therefore, in order to solve the disappearances that have been occurring in the Rukon District, it’s been decided that you three will be sent to investigate Yes, sir! So I get to be the leader of this group, right There is no need for one Huh But no matter how you look at it, I’m the leader here! How did you come to such conclusions Hisagi, keep an eye on Matsumoto to make sure she doesn’t do something crazy on her own I’m counting on you Yes, sir! Captain, that’s mean! When do I ever do crazy things on my own Always! Now, now, Rangiku Calm down Captain Hitsugaya put his trust in me  People do take notice of one’s hard work I knew it  Boy, the captain can be so rude! The skies are looking like rain, so we’d better hurry What But I’m a bit tired Let’s rest a bit You rested just a while ago We’re almost at our destination, and it’ll be difficult to move once the sun sets Man, I wish I could’ve come later with Isane and the others Lieutenant Kotetsu is leading the rescue party, so she has a lot of material and people with her That’s why we’re going on ahead I know that Cold! Let’s hurry! Oh! I hate this! If we’re in the field shown on this map, then our destination is somewhere around here There’s no need to rush It’ll take time for Isane and her group to catch up with us anyway, so let’s take our time to look around and investigate along the way Hey! I think the rain has stopped! Lovely, isn’t it Shuhei, stop looking so serious over there and take a look around you Uh… Sure Wait a second  We’re in the boonies of the Rukon District with no one around  Is it possible that Rangiku is enjoying her time alone with me  And that smile…  Is something wrong, Shuhei Uh, no… Nothing wrong, ma’am! Stop thinking silly thoughts, Shuhei Hisagi!  W-Wow… Sure is a soothing sight for the soul, isn’t it Do you like it Huh Uh…Y-Yes I mean, it’s a lovely landscape Yes, it is We’ve kept this landscape this way for a long time Uh… I see Shuhei!

Are you all right Does it hurt Um… No… Proprietress, could you get us some water Yes! Right away! Uh… Rangiku, your…hand, it’s… Shuhei, you mustn’t let your guard down with that proprietress Huh Just do as I say, okay Okay Just as I thought, Rangiku is conscious of the proprietress  Which means, she thinks of me as…   Whew! Im so full! Huh What’s the matter You weren’t hungry No, that’s not it Drat I was so conscious of her my food wouldn’t go down   You need to eat Or else, you won’t be of use when trouble occurs I don’t want that to happen You won’t be of use when trouble occurs I don’t want that to happen I don’t want that to happen I don’t want that to happen R-Right! Excuse me I’ve come to take away your trays Thank you I’ll be finished shortly Shuhei, you don’t need to try to be so nice to her We’re the guests here I know, but… That’s all right Please take your time Say, there’s an outdoor bath outside this room Is it usable Yes, it is You’re welcome to use it Yes! Please enjoy The bath’s just right I knew it Rangiku is jealous of the proprietress  It proves how interested she is in me  No, no, no!  Wait! Calm down, Shuhei Hisagi!  We’re here on a mission  Don’t think of such perverse thoughts  Work comes first!  Get your act straight, Shuhei Hisagi!  I need to confirm the agenda of this mission!  I think I’ll go for a dip in the outdoor bath! I’ll go for a dip In the outdoor bath In the outdoor bath In the outdoor bath In the… Here they are What’s a hot spa inn without yukata I’m going in first, Shuhei Right… Shuhei, I think you already know this, but… If you peek, I’ll kill you R-Right! Calm down, Shuhei Hisagi Let’s sort out the situation  The weather worsened, and the sun set  By perfect coincidence, there was an inn  So, we decide to stay the night  Okay, so it’s simple logic  I get it, I get it  It was totally out of my control  Rangiku, too, had no choice but to stay the night with me  That has to be it  And as for the proprietress, it was nothing more than Rangiku showing concern for me as a colleague  By the way, Rangiku! Where is my room Surely we’re not going to stay in the same room, are we We’ll be together I asked earlier to have the bedding set out together What! What You don’t want to share a room with me N-N-No, that’s not it at all! Then there’s no problem The water feels so good What’s the matter Why are you sighing Uh, um… How’s the weather There’s a lovely moon out I-I see The breeze feels nice, too Nothing beats an outdoor bath Th-That’s nice Why don’t you come in too You must be tired, right What You haven’t taken any days off recently Working is fine, too, but you need to rest sometimes, or you’ll wear yourself out Rangiku is worried about me  Just as I thought, people do watch!  It isn’t just Captain Hitsugaya!  Rangiku understands how I feel as well!  I’m so glad I did my best  WHY DON’T YOU COME IN TOO She just said, “Why don’t you come in too”  Does that mean…she wants me to join her!  Wait, just a moment ago, she said she’d kill me for that  If you peek, I’ll kill you Or should I not take it literally  If you peek, I’ll kill you I think I get it Could that “I’ll kill you” have meant she was inviting me  I’ll…kill…you No, no, it couldn’t be…but…but…  What should I do!  Rangiku! Rangiku, I’m coming to be “killed” Growl! Haineko! Shuhei! Come here quickly! What’s going on! A Hollow! This was the culprit in the string of disappearances! What Growl…Haineko! ReapKazeshini! You did it, Shuhei! I don’t get it What’s going on The proprietress of this inn was the culprit responsible for the disappearances What! At first, I wasn’t certain, so I came here to investigate, only to have her suddenly appear before us I didn’t see that coming And what’s more, she was definitely sending you some strange Spiritual Pressure Strange Spiritual Pressure Didn’t you feel it Not at all I knew it You see, only men have been attacked Handsome ones at that That’s why I had you come with me as a lure It turned out to be the right decision What! Nobody told me anything about that! They say to deceive your enemy, you have to deceive your friend first I wanted to do this after Isane and the others arrived and we were set up, but the enemy snapped at the bait Huh What’s the matter That’s cruel, Rangiku Sorry, sorry But you were the only one who could pull off this role There aren’t any other good-looking guys with great skills And you just forgave her! When Rangiku said that, I didn’t feel bad about it Do you think she meant that Maybe she’s still pulling the wool over your eyes Kira, it’s not good to be so cynical You sure Kusajishi Hey, listen Kenny busted the wall, can you help us repair it Why me Because I heard that if we ever need help, we should ask you, Hisa-hisa! That’s probably Matsumoto who’s spreading that around Yup! And also… Shuhei is the only person I can count on That’s what she said! I see So Rangiku’s counting on me It’s not easy being a talented man What Hisagi! Okay! Where’s the site! Let’s go! He is hopeless Hisa-hisa sure does prove his title as the Best Male Soul Reaper! Wow, that’s impressive Guess I have a lot to learn from Hisagi Yup, he is! In our last ladies night out, he got our unanimous vote as the most useful errand boy That’s his title! Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers Shuhei! Yes, Rangiku Can you carry these to the Squad Barracks Gladly! Shuhei! Yes Stamp these for approval, will you Gladly Shuhei! Y-Yes Can you wash these for me He seems to be losing his health lately I’m worried It’s your fault!"
" Don’t think you can stop me with your current power! What do you mean Look at this world! This world of yours used to be filled with skyscrapers, full of hope! Now it has sunken low to look like the small town that’s dear to you! The rain that continued to fall on this world has subsided, but in its place, everything has sunk into this ocean! This all happened, Ichigo, because you lost hope and stopped moving forward! I will drag out the root of your despair right here and now! It’s been a long time, Ichigo What’s with that look Don’t you recognize me Y-You Why! You were supposed to be gone after our last encounter! Did you forget I warned you: If you really want to control my power, then be sure not to die before the next time I appear! Damn it I thought I crushed you for good back then Well, too bad for you It’s even pitiful Why do you look like that, wearing that weird mask That’s right… This is your first time seeing this form This is how you looked when you defeated Ulquiorra Shifar I looked…like that That’s right This is the form you feared You feared this form wherein your destructive impulses crushed your soul It made you unable to complete a full Hollowfication So… So what do you want me to do then! Am I supposed to fight that guy now and defeat him! Wrong He is not the opponent you will fight It’s both of us As one What What’s…going on! We were one… to begin with Both of us… are your power Here I come, Ichigo! Arisawa! Impressive You’re this close to me, yet you are still able to maintain your existence Who…are you Run, Asano!

How cruel can you be, girl So cruel! For your own good, go on home There’s nothing you can do here I believe youre at the limit of withstanding my Spiritual Pressure Or rather…I should compliment you for withstanding it this long Listen to me! Run away right now! There’s nothing you can do! Run Is that something to say to this hero Ignorant girl I’ll have you know that children do not call a hero that runs away a “hero”! Cannon Ball! Super Spirit Cane… Kanonji Buster! Stop it If a mere human like you touches me, you will cease to exist Kanonji! I made it in time Don’t think you can stop me with your current power! If you don’t take this seriously, you’ll die He’s not bluffing! Is he really trying to kill me! Are you done Not so fast Done Hardly No matter how many times I get knocked down, I’ll keep getting up until you tell me what the Final Getsugatensho is! Interesting Do you really think I’ll teach you with such half-hearted resolve! If you don’t want to teach me, then I’ll just have to force it out of you! Looks like you’ve finally decided to fight seriously But you won’t even be able to land a single blow against me Take this! I made it in time Aizen… Gin… Rangiku Who… Who are you, girl! It’s dangerous! This is no place for a girl like you to be! Civilians should stay back! Run I’ll stop them, so you guys get out of here this instant! Wh-What are you talking about, girl I, Don… Shut up already! Stop jabbering and carry those kids on your back and run!

If you find yourself in danger, call a hero! Call out, “Save me! Don…” Ouch! No! That didn’t hurt!! Farewell! Who could she be Is she a friend of Ichigo’s Their kimonos look similar She’s beautiful That Ichigo He never told me he had such a beautiful friend By “made it in time,” were you referring to saving those humans Or were you referring to me destroying Karakura Town and creating the Ouken Well, either way, you were wrong What’s the matter Do you find it hard to talk to me Captain Aizen Please forgive my former acquaintance I’ll take her away I don’t mind I have time You’re welcome to talk at length with her there But we would be in your way Not at all My, my… As always, he is such an amusing child You arched your body at the last second A useless effort He’s strong His speed is incredible! I had no time to block it with my Zanpakuto So now you realize the difference in our strength “Force it out of me” Don’t make me laugh! You’re only running away! Shut up! I have to get it out of you no matter what it takes! How pathetic! What! Ichigo! Be gone from this world of yours! Let go of me! You’re staggering Why’d you come I lost track of your Spiritual Pressure, so I took the Senkaimon to get the jump on you After all, I had a better grasp of where the real Karakura Town was transported! I didn’t ask how you got here I want to know why you came here in your shaky condition Isn’t it obvious Because you’re here Finally, I can ask you directly Why did you decide to work under Aizen Why Why did you betray Kira, who trusted you! Are you seriously asking me that You say I betrayed him in spite of his trust Are you really talking about Izuru here Man, why did you have to come here, anyway You know, Rangiku… You’re a nuisance Damn… Is he trying to kick me out of this world! I don’t have the time for this! Getsugatensho! So you’ve come back Sorry But you know I don’t give up easily You’ll have to deal with me a little longer! A little longer, you say Yeah!

Kanonji, Im fine I can walk No You mustn’t overexert yourself, girl I said I’m fine! Ouch! Why won’t you listen the first time I tell you! Oh… Strong hit Arisawa! Asano! I told you to get away Where did you get that sword Mr Afro was lying collapsed over that way, so I borrowed his sword! I’ve never done kendo or anything of the sort, but I figure it’s better than having nothing! Who’s Mr Afro I’ll explain later Anyway, let’s get going! Where’s Chizuru And Kojima! Didn’t you go looking for them! I found Mizuiro! He’s over there! Honsho’s with him too! Now’s not the time for questions! We have to get away from here! I can feel that guy’s presence He’s closing in on us! They’re waiting for you However, that’s none of my concern Yeah, that may be so You did say… The fate of what you want to protect is none of my concern What you want to protect is not what I want to protect But the thing is… What I want to protect hasn’t changed It may be different from yours, but that’s not the issue! I… I will protect what I want to protect! And that’s what Getsugatensho is for That’s right What! His sword… Something’s different One question, Ichigo You said earlier that no matter how many times you get knocked down, you’ll keep getting up I did What of it All right Then let me test you! Test what! Not yet Ichigo! Arisawa! We have to run, quickly! But where can we run He’ll catch us right away! No… You have a plan To escape without a plan… That is where love leads to As the two continue their escape, they soon fall in love with each… Die Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers I am Don Kanonji!

So, have you heard the situation I got the gist from Keigo Whats most important is that some dangerous guy is coming for our lives So, I got these A stun gun for each of us Whered you get those Theyre no good It wont work against him He can immobilize us just by approaching He even turned Kanonjis stick into ash just by coming in contact with it Not a stick!

Huh What I have returned, Captain Aizen Whats going on! Do you think that guy is here to save us, or something No matter how you look at it, it doesnt seem that way Im afraid its the exact opposite This is really bad Youre back What about the woman I killed her Indeed Her Spiritual Pressure has disappeared Im surprised I thought you had a little more affection for her Affection I dont have any such thing I told you the first time I met you Im a snake My skin is cold I have no heart I use the tip of my tongue to find my prey as I slither on the ground and engulf what I like whole Thats the sort of creature I am Isnt that what I told you Wh-Whatre you just standing there for, boys and girls! This is no time to be gawking! Th-Thats right! Lets get away! Quickly! My, my Ive grown tired of catching mice What will you do with them after you kill them Ill string their corpses up somewhere on the outskirts of town where theyll be easy to see, then get to work on creating the Ouken Sounds good to me In that case Ill handle killing those kids Gin Sounds good to me In that case Ill handle killing those kids Gin The only way to escape the power of Kyokasuigetsu is to touch its blade, before it puts you under Complete Hypnosis It took me decades just to get that single fact out of you Not a single person among the Thirteen Court Guard Squads knew that but they all thought they could kill you, Captain Aizen Watching them made me very nervous The only one who can kill you is me, Captain Aizen I knew that I brought you with me, knowing what your objective was, because I was interested in how you would try to kill me But Im disappointed, Gin Did you really think you could kill me with something like this No, I didnt Can you see this Theres a chip here Just now, I left that chip inside your body, Captain Aizen What! My Bankais power I told you about it before, didnt I Sorry, I lied It doesnt extend as long as I said It doesnt extend as fast as I said However, when it extends and contracts, it turns to dust for just an instant Also Inside the blade, there is a powerful poison that dissolves and destroys cells Looks like you understand When I withdrew my sword from your chest, A single chip of my blade didnt turn to dust and was left inside of your heart Gin! If youre going to say something, youd better do it fast Well, even if you try, youre going to die anyway Killem, Kamishininoyari Gin Damn you! Youll die with a hole through your heart Isnt that what you wanted Gin Gin Its over Its over now W-What is that! How would I know! Its hopeless! Were all going to die! Chizuru, pull yourself together! What could that be I dont know! But I get the feeling its something seriously bad! I winGin Even without being inside of me, that Hogyoku you took belongs to me Whatthe hell! Hes the one  Hes the boss  Ill   kill him  If you were to turn into a snake tomorrow, and began devouring humans, and from the same mouth that you devoured humans, you cried out to me I love you! Would I still be able to say I love you, in the same way I do today Arrancar Encyclopedia I have sad news for all of you With no more Arrancars left to talk about, this will be our final segment of the Arrancar Encyclopedia They put me through so much crap, but that is also finally over So it wouldnt hurt to have things done my way for this last Huh Wait! Im not finished yet! Huh Why is it ending like this"
" Where were you, Gin! Im going to become a Soul Reaper In that case Ill handle killing those kids Gin Killem, Kamishininoyari Gin Damn you! Gin Its over Its over now W-What is that! How would I know! I win, Gin Even without being inside of me, that Hogyoku you took belongs to me Whatthe hell! If you were to turn into a snake tomorrow,  and began devouring humans,  and from the same mouth you devoured humans,  you cried out to me, I love you!  Would I still be able to say I love you,  the same way I do today  This sensationis Hakufuku Gin!  Yes  I had already come across the answer known as the Hogyoku Even before Kisuke Urahara did However, it failed  In order to complete the Hogyoku, I gouged out the souls of hundreds of Soul Reapers and hundreds of residents of the Rukon District  who possessed latent Soul Reaper powers and gave them to the Hogyoku Yet even that did not satisfy the Hogyoku But judging from the results of his experiments,  Kisuke Uraharas Hogyoku was not complete either That being so, I decide to steal his Hogyoku and give it to mine  By doing so  Evolution requires fear The fear that, in your current state, you could die and disappear at any moment Thank you, Gin Thanks to you, I have finally become a being that transcends both Soul Reapers and Hollows W-What happened Maybe they had a falling out and took each other down or something W-What is that! A-Arisawa Kanonji! Gin! Gin! Where were you, Gin! Is that a Soul Reaper uniform Where did you get that Ive made up my mind Im going to become a Soul Reaper Im going to become a Soul Reaper and change things Ill fix it so you wont have to cry anymore, Rangiku Gin! But I failed  In the end  I couldnt retrieve what was taken from you, Rangiku  Im glad  Goodbye, Rangiku  Im sorry  Im glad I apologized  Thanks Dad I-Is thatIchigo Its Ichigo, right Why is his hair long Maybe its because of the hair Butdoes he look a bit taller than before Good Yuzu and Karin seem to be okay Tatsuki Keigo Mizuiro Honsho Kanonji Imoyama Who! Im Kurumadani! Zennosuke Kurumadani! If you cant remember, at least be honest about it! Dont name people based on your perceptions! Everyone, stay where you are Stay still, right where you are W-What do you mean Ichigo I dont feel anything  This isnt right  I can feel his overwhelming power from the other guy  But from IchigoI dont feel anything  Ichigo Kurosaki Are you really Ichigo Kurosaki What do you mean If you really are Ichigo Kurosaki then youre a disappointment I dont feel any Spiritual Pressure from you now Even if youre suppressing your Spiritual Pressure, theres no way that I wouldnt notice it at all You failed to evolve You let the final chance that I gave you slip away For your own good Get out of here  You dont want to die yet, do you  Ah  Your eyes have more power in them  Thats good  You are at a level now  where I can die and leave the rest to you   Its unfortunate, Kurosaki Aizen Lets do this elsewhere I dont want to fight here A meaningless suggestion Those are words only someone who has the power to give me a challenge has the right to say Theres no need to worry There will be no need to destroy Karakura Town You will What! Impossible Theres no way he could force me like this Lets do this, Aizen Ill end all of this in an instant Lets do this, Aizen Ill end all of this in an instant End it in an instant I see I understand now, Ichigo Kurosaki Why you lost your Spiritual Pressure You didnt lose your Spiritual Pressure You discarded it I dont know how you did it, but you converted all of your Spiritual Pressure into your bodys physical strength Arm strength, leg strength, grip, throwing, running In exchange for drastically improving every one of your physical abilities, you have discarded your Spiritual Pressure All because you gave up fighting me, Spiritual Pressure versus Spiritual Pressure Butdo despair I will teach you that the physical strength you were counting on is incomparable to my own power Whats that You parried that well How shocked you must be though The landscape changes with a single swing of my sword That is how powerful I am now To be honest, I didnt think my abilities had improved to this extent Im happy, Ichigo Kurosaki Thanks to you, I can test these powers that transcend those of Hollows and Soul Reapers to my hearts content Im not done yet, Ichigo Kurosaki! Did you really think I couldnt follow your moves By some odd coincidence, we seem to have arrived at a similar evolved form where our right arms are combined with our Zanpakuto Perhaps this is the true form of the Zanpakuto Whats so funny I realized it during our clash just now As I suspected, your evolution and mine are on different levels If I so wish I can shatter your Zanpakuto with a single swing! Impossible!  He caught it!  Dodging it, I could understand  Though he shouldnt even be able to dodge at that speed to begin with  Even so, dodging it, I could understand  Buthe caught it!  He caught my blow  Why so surprised Is it so unbelievable that I caught your sword What Does it scare you That something you cant comprehend happened right  before your eyes Interesting, Ichigo Kurosaki Something I cant comprehend, you say Dont talk as though youve won It was simply a case of your physical strength momentarily exceeding mine Miracles like that happen from time to time But I am a being who surpasses even that In that case, I will see to it that miracles like that never happen again by crushing you to pieces with Kido! The oozing crest of corruption! The arrogant vessel of madness! Deny the seething urge Stun and flicker Disrupt the sleep! The crawling queen of iron! The eternally self-destructing doll of mud! Unite! Repulse! Fill the earth, and know your own powerlessness! Hado Number 90: Kurohitsugi! Now that I transcend both Hollows and Soul Reapers, this is Kurohitsugi with a full incantation! It unleashes enough gravity to warp time and space! The likes of you could never comprehend it, Ichigo Kurosaki! You dont seem to realize, do you My power is greater than the power you have right now The force that erased that mountain was my sword Here I come, Aizen All Humans are an imitation of apes All Gods are an imitation of Humans Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! Whats up! Its me, the Great Kon! Youre wondering why a super star like me is lying on the ground like this When I woke up, I realized something strange happening to the town Not sure if it was safe to get up, I decided to stay down and see how things go Huh Looks like someones coming I hope its a cute girl Oh, with big What is this! His eyeball is way too close Its freaky! Whats going on! Someone help!"
" Yes This is inexcusable, isnt it, Hogyoku This is the Final Getsugatensho Impossible!  He caught it!  Why so surprised Does it scare you That something you cant comprehend happened right before your eyes Hado Number 90: Kurohitsugi! Now that I transcend both  Hollows and Soul Reapers, this is Kurohitsugi with a full incantation! You dont seem to realize, do you My power is greater than the  power you have right now What an odd feeling When I backed away from  you in our last battle, you asked me why But now youre doing the exact same thing So let me ask you the same question Why did you back away just now I see Youre pleased that you stopped my sword Are you pleased that you overcame my Kido Are you pleased that you  put a scar on my body Dont be so full of yourself, human! Yes This is inexcusable, isnt it, Hogyoku That I let a human get the better of me Ichigo I see You took my attack with so little damage However, that left arm of  yours is no longer usable Can you hear me, Ichigo Kurosaki Indeed, for a moment, you broke the boundary between Hollows and Soul Reapers to become a transcendent being But that power is no more! Not a trace of it remains! Youre not even worth trying  to understand any more I, a true transcendent being, will kill you By killing you, I will completely break free from both insignificant Soul Reapers and Hollows alike Its over! Ichigo Kurosaki! Over, you say Is this all youve got Lets end this already, Aizen Ive grown sickof your arguments Ill show you This is the Final Getsugatensho! What is that form! You still refuse to stay down, Ichigo I told you I wouldnt go down Not until you tell me what  the Final Getsugatensho is I said I have no intention of telling you! What is this  If he were serious about defeating me,  he couldve done it at the very start There was that great a difference  between our powers  If he had no serious  intention of telling me,  he should stop fighting and keep himself hidden  It would have been easy  for him to just do that  What is this  Why is it that I only sense sadness  flowing from his blade Youve realized it The only way to acquire the Final Getsugatensho is to accept my blade Theres no pain Of course not I, Tensa Zangetsu, am originally you If you accept me, there can be no pain when I run you through Whyare you crying Ichigo Do you recall what I said  when we started this fight Dont misunderstand, Ichigo What you want to protect is not what I want to protect I do What I wanted to protect was you, Ichigo What do you mean The answer will be conveyed directly through this blade, along with the techniques secret Ichigo If you use this technique, you will The Final Getsugatensho is me becoming Getsuga itself The Final Getsugatensho If I use this technique, I will lose all of my Soul Reaper powers Thats what final means I still cant sense his power  I have evolved into a being far  beyond that of a Soul Reaper Just as two-dimensional beings  can never interact with  three-dimensional beings, no Soul Reaper or human could  detect my Spiritual Pressure unless I deliberately brought down my  powers to their level of awareness Could itpossibly be that he  is at an even higher level than myself  Absurd! That couldnt possibly be! A mere human cannot surpass me! That cant be! Mugetsu If you use this technique,  you will lose all of your Soul Reaper powers Farewell, Ichigo  He is still able to regenerate Crap My Soul Reaper powers are disappearing Ichigo Kurosaki You lose Observe My Zanpakuto is fading away You should know what that means The Hogyoku has determined that I have no need for a Zanpakuto! Like you, I have become one with the Zanpakuto and its powers In fact, you no longer have that power, while I will reach a level  far beyond that of yours! Its over! Ichigo Kurosaki! What is this! Kido! But when was I attacked! Seems its finally taking effect Mr Urahara! Kisuke Urahara, is this your doing! Yes Before you were able to  completely transformed, when you were most vulnerable, I planted that Kido into another Kido and shot it into your body Its a seal I figured that once you  fused with the Hogyoku, killing you would be nearly impossible So I invented a new Kido to seal you off Is that so I hate to disappoint you See! At this moment, I am about  to evolve even further You cant seal me off with this level of Kido! What! Whats happening It is the Hogyokus will The reason the seal that I shot into your body is only taking effect now is because your powers have weakened It was thanks to Kurosaki It was able to take effect  because he fought this hard and pushed you to your limit The Hogyoku is saying that it does  not recognize you as its master Thats absurd That cant be Theres no way! Kisuke Urahara! I despise you! With your great intellect,  why wont you take action! Why do you subjugate yourself to that thing! That thing You mean the Soul King I understand now You saw, didnt you Without the existence of the Soul King, Soul Society would split apart The Soul King is the keystone Without the keystone in place,  it would fall apart easily Thats how the world is Thats an argument a loser would make! A victor must always speak of how the world should be rather than how the world is! I Ichigo Its over, isnt it, Ichigo Say, Mr Urahara The training in the Precipice World has made me a little bit older than my friends, right I suppose you could say that Yeah Its not a bad feeling  being older than the others To put it another way, it also means youre an old  man compared to the others What Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers You there Wake up Youll catch a cold  sleeping in such a place We work for a heavenly place called the Department of Research and Development Im up!

How did the battle go Captain Yeah Whyre you following me Dumb dog It was a lousy battle Kurosaki Mr Urahara Where is everyone I sent them all home They all seemed to want  to talk to you, Kurosaki, but they seemed just as  hesitant to approach you You didnt erase their memories, did you No Not this time I see Thats good I was tired of hiding things from them When I get back, Ill  personally explain it to them Aizens Cross Seal was  taken to the Seireitei Central 46 will soon make a decision on how to handle him I see Why the solemn look I dont know I dont really know myself You saved everyones life  and this world because you risked your life to  battle Aizen and defeat him I know that You did the right thing Theres no reason at  all to look so solemn Kurosaki Say, Mr Urahara Was Aizen Was Aizen really rejected by the Hogyoku My old man told me that the Hogyokus power is to take in the heart surrounding itself, and manifesting its desires If thats the case, could it be that Aizen lost his powers of his own will After I attained enough power to battle Aizen on even terms, I was finally able to feel his sword There was nothing but  loneliness in his sword If his powers were superior from the time he was born, perhaps he was searching all this time for someone he could regard as his equal Then, ever since the moment he gave up thinking hed  ever find such a rival, hes been wishing somewhere in his heart that he could become a mere Soul Reaper K-Kurosaki InoueIshidaRukiaChadRenji Whats up with you guys Is it okay for you to be up already! Dont put me in the same league as you Yeah Its not an issue What about you What is that It It is you, after all Your hair is long, so I thought maybe it wasnt you Im gladIm so glad Whats with that look, Inoue Well I guess my hair is a mess -Ichigo! -Ichigo! Kurosaki! Ichigo! Hey, Ichigo! K-Kurosaki We will now pass judgment! Former Squad 5 Captain, Sosuke Aizen We sentence you to the lowest level of the  Underground Prison 8: Muken, where you will remain for 18,800 years! I see The likes of you, passing judgment on me It strikes me as a bit comical Traitor! Pushing your luck just  because youre immortal! Restrain his eye and mouth  as well immediately! Increase his sentence to 20,000 years! Yes, yes! Idiots! You lost your Captains Coat! Tearing it is one thing, but losing it! How can you look so nonchalant about it! Head Captain Do not worry It was just a cheap coat,  so I will pay for it Thats not what Im concerned about! And it wasnt cheap, you idiot! Listen! Battles arent just about winning! What do you people think the Captains Coat is anyway! A nuisance Cheap Fashion Youre all idiots! The Head Captain seems  to be in good spirits Yeah Listen carefully now! Its been ten days since the battle A Captains Coat is a symbol of He lost his left arm, the Thirteen Court Guard Squads but his strength seems to  be back, so Im relieved And of all the things, you lose it! Theres still no Soul  Reaper in the Soul Society who can take his place Captain! Captain Kurotsuchi, where are you! If youre looking for the  captain, hes not here He went to Hueco Mundo to  do research or something What! Again! Whatll I do Lieutenant Hinamoris been left in our care to heal her internal organs, right Lieutenant Matsumoto is here  to pay her a visit, and Lieutenant Hinamori is not  allowed any visitors Besides, we cannot allow outsiders into the research facility when  Captain Kurotsuchi isnt here Im sorry, Lieutenant Matsumoto I dont see her Huh! This isnt good enough  At this rate  At this rate, Ill never become able to protect Hinamori! I have to become more adept at using  Hyorinmarus Bankai Youve gone away, but you didnt leave behind even a keepsake to remember you by Thats what I didnt like about you  Theyre moving on  Neither Shuhei nor Renji  were at the barracks  They must be somewhere brushing up on their skills and strength I need to as well  Youre right  If you had left behind a keepsake,  it would have probably kept  me from moving forward You must have certainly  seen that weakness in me  Thank you, Gin  Thats what I  loved about you  Kurosaki! Where am I My home Huh You guys! What happened to your injuries! We healed up a long time ago A long time ago Ten days have already passed, you know Ten days My powers Dont worry They havent disappeared yet You know Yes, I heard from Urahara I see Kurosaki Ten days ago, you collapsed the moment we were reunited -Ichigo! -Ichigo!  Kurosaki!  Kurosaki! Kurosaki!  Ichigo! Hey, pull yourself together!  Mr Urahara What happened to Kurosaki  Tell us, Urahara  What happened  According to Urahara, there are several stages in the course of losing your Spiritual Pressure Stages Yes First, you lose consciousness and the time that your body spent inside the Precipice World flows in reverse See how your hair is shorter Your height has returned  to what it used to be, and your Spiritual Pressure is stable now And of course, you still retain  your Soul Reaper powers Eventually, however, it will move to the next stage When that happens, he  will black out once more, accompanied by intense pain When he regains consciousness the next time, he will lose all Soul Reaper powers It could occur tomorrow, the day after that, or maybe even a year later Even I dont know how  long his current state of unstable Spiritual Pressure will continue Well, when that time comes, it comes Kurosaki Dont worry, Inoue More importantly, Im  glad all of you are okay But Whatre you talking about! All okay, you say! You know youre going to  lose your Spirit Energy! Ishida I did what I did knowing  all of the consequences I have no regrets I see Anyway, now that were all healed up, theres no need for us to stay here, right Lets hurry and get back to Karakura Town Everyones waiting for us Head Captain What is it As apology, I prepared you a new coat You still dont get it, do you!

Youre welcome to use this Oh Seizo! Get over here! Coming! Thanks Whats the matter That fellow Huh You mean Seizo He alone seems different from the rest I was wondering why hes in Squad 11 Now that you mention it, hes quiet and doesnt really stand out But he was like that since the time I was a member of Squad 11 Whatre you guys jabbering about! Hey, Ikkaku Seizo has always been the quiet type, right Huh Wouldnt know Excuse me Thanks for this earlier Here Sure Thanks for bringing it back Um Do you need any help Thats okay No one in Squad 11 can do this sort of work as fast as I can Oh, I see Besides, wouldnt you have more fun training with the others Fun Yes I can tell When you were in there training with them, you looked truly happy No, that was just me getting  caught in the flow of things But I have one word of advice They use wooden swords, not  Zapakuto, in their training Sword skills are whats important, not just your Spirit Energy Sword skills A tree with weak roots  is easy to topple over Even more so when it has thin branches Roots, you say A sword is, after all, nothing  but the tip of a branch What Im saying is that  putting your strength into the sword is meaningless if your roots, your lower body, arent  firmly planted in the ground I see Youre totally overdoing it Sorry about that My true skill showed Whered you pick up how to do that Its skills That so Thank you Thanks Hey, Seizo! Coming! TEA HOUSE Seizo Oh, you mean Seizo Harugasaki Thats his family name, huh So, what about him Well, how shall I say this Squad 11s members are  rough, vulgar and crude Thats all there is, you know I find it difficult to  ignore what you just said At the very least, Im  different, arent I Lets put that aside for now, okay No, its not okay! But that man is very mild-mannered The people around him treat him terribly Thats because hes physically weak Squad 11 is a combat squad Even the younger members treat someone who is weak badly Its true that he doesnt have much Spiritual Pressure, but somehow he doesnt feel like an ordinary fellow to me He joined us the same time as Ikkaku Ikkaku Back then, he was regarded  as a promising Soul Reaper His sword skills were a sight to behold His sword skill was dynamic, yet steady He was a straightforward Soul Reaper who never resorted to tricks Away you go! Their skills compared favorably, but his straightforward fighting style didnt match up well He lost to Ikkaku repeatedly You dont get it, do you You cant take me on and hope to win without using some sort of ploy! I know that its impossible! But I wont give up, no  matter how many times I fail! I had no idea Why is someone with such skill now being treated like some lackey It happened when the two were part of a team to take down a Hollow Our scout hasnt come back Madarame, Ill go Cover me Dont be ridiculous! I should be the one to go! How many times have you lost when we went head-to-head! I didnt lose Those were draws Ive heard of sore losers,  but youre something else The Hollow! Takashige! Damn it! Wait, Madarame! The weak follow the strong! Thats the Squad 11 rule! That was easy What the heck I cant pull it out! Your Spirit Energyis mine! That Hollow possessed the ability  to suck away Spirit Energy Seizo lost most of his Spirit  Energy to that Hollow Since then, his Spirit  Energy has never returned So thats what happened Once he lost his Spirit Energy, he could not fulfill his  duties as a Soul Reaper, especially as a combatant Yet he refused to transfer to another squad I heard what happened Yourepretty awesome  with the sword, I hear Nope You talked about roots,  and how happy I looked You sounded pretty patronizing,  so I began to wonder Isnt it you whos unhappy having to do work like this! Oops, sorry Its okay You want to wield a sword  and fight too, right Why are you just smiling and  doing odd jobs for everybody And whats with Ikkaku Its his fault that you  lost your Spirit energy Wouldnt know  So whats with that attitude! Third Seat Madarame is too far above me And I have no strength to fight I am no longer a concern  to Third Seat Madarame He is not even interested in what I do But even so The truth is, in three days, I will be discharged from the  Thirteen Court Guard Squads What! All I can do is leave quietly If you have only three days left, then its all the more reason! Enough already! You want me to have a match with that bastard Harugasaki Yeah Youve gotta be kidding Im not interested in a weak bastard Maybe so, but wasnt he strong once That was a long time ago And first of all, theres no  way hed have a match with me Shouldnt you be trying to  convince him instead of me For crying out loud No, as I told you, I have no such intention Why not! If you decide to fight, I know Ikkaku will be willing as well! Even if I did, Id only disappoint him I want him to remember me as I was back then, when I  had confidence in my skills Please understand Youve done enough, Ichigo Renji SeizoIm sorry Lieutenant Abarai, please! Dont let it bother you I understand Then lets have a match! If I lose, Ill back off But if I win, youll do as I ask! You dont understand a thing, do you! You ask for a match, but Ive told you I have  no strength to fight I know The match isnt going  to be one of strength! Huh Doing the laundry, putting  bandages away and cleaning The one who finishes first wins! But I would definitely have the advantage We wont know until we try! Here goes! Seizo wins Damn it! It wasnt even close Im sorry Please give up No! Were doing it again tomorrow! Huh Ichigo, you I never said Id give up after one try! You dont get it, do you Its no use, no matter  how many times you try I know that its impossible! But I wont give up, no  matter how many times I fail! You dont get it, do you You cant take me on and hope to win without using some sort of ploy! I know that its impossible! But I wont give up, no  matter how many times I fail! Yumichika Were heading out The Hollows have reappeared Come with us as logistical support Yes, sir! Sorry, looks like a match  is out of the question! Ichigo! Right! Damn you! Theyre getting away, Ikkaku! Like Im going to let them! Okay! The logistical support team  will attend to casualties! Those of you who can move, were  going after the Hollows! Lets go, Ichigo! Right! Go! Well handle things here! Sorry! Are you all right This wound is nothing! Im not a weakling like you! Fools! They never realized we had split up What! We run away very fast, you see Once we lost them, we  came back for our meal Relax Well take our time to chew you well before swallowing you Hollows Five of them Itd be impossible for me to fight them I know that its impossible! But I wont give up, no  matter how many times I fail! Is that your weapon! Theres no way you can fight the five of us with that sword! I know that its impossible! But I wont give up, no  matter how many times I fail! I never expected you to give us so much trouble with your  meager Spirit Energy! But this is the end of the line! Prepare to die! So this is where I die But thats okay Thank you, Ichigo Kurosaki You have made me regain my honor as a Soul Reaper in my final moments Here I come! Madarame! Youve returned! No Its you who has returned! Now cover my back! You came to see me off Yeah Thank you very much Take care, you two You too Well then To Squad Member Seizo Harugasaki Bow! Say, Ikkaku Where did Kenpachi go, anyway Now that you mention it I havent seen either the Captain or the Lieutenant around lately What! Are you sure thats okay Its probably that time  of year where I need to have Captain Unohana make an announcement for a lost person They have seasons for that Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! Squad 11 is a bit filthy,  wouldnt you say Its like loincloths are  a must-wear fashion item! So true Ikkaku and his  kind are so stifling Oh, Fifth Seat Ayasegawa! So are you! Im positive that inside,  youre as stifling as the rest! You dont get it, do you Isnt that gap exactly what beauty is Tell me, Ikkaku Am I filthy Am I stifling "

Isnt that mean Well yes, but I dont think before or after he eats really matters You know Im going to kill myself! What! I cant go on living after breaking up with Ken Goodbye, Blond-boy Thank you for rescuing me Hey, wait! Theres nothing to gain by dying! If you die, the Hollows will come after you, and going to the Soul Society isnt all that great either Look out! Man, I dont see a Hollow anywhere Huh Rukia! Oh, Ichigo Is something up Yeah Look there! Did a Hollow do that No An ordinary Hollow would only go after human souls So its not a Hollow Wait Lets not be hasty, Ichigo Recently There have been five identical incidents such as this one Five! Yes The Soul Society has been on special alert for cases like this one The Spiritual Pressure of the Hollow believed to be responsible for the incidents appears and disappears with each event, making it extremely difficult to track it down But this body died very recently The victims attacker couldnt have gone very far Right now, our priority is to stop the next attack before it happens I want you to go on ahead and chase after the attacker! What about you Ill follow you after I turn over this crime scene to the others Now get going! Got it! Stupid Ken After all I did for you Im home  Welcome home, Ken!  Enjoy your dinner!  All right!

This Spiritual Pressure Could it be a Hollow No! Now open your mouth wider! I will leech on to you and then suck out your nutrients! Just like I did to that dead man there! The Great Kon Shoot!

Huh If you hadnt saved me, I could have died right there! Why couldnt you just leave me alone! Come on You cant be serious How can you say something like that! Dont talk about wanting to die so easily! That guy who was killed back there I guarantee he didnt want to die that way!

" Captain! Huh That’s odd Where did Captain go If you’re looking for  Captain Hitsugaya, he’s supposed to be  on leave starting today Oh! That’s right I forgot That means I’ll have to take  care of all these documents Captain, why’d you  have to take leave Yours, Kurosaki! Got it! Toshiro! You sure saved us, Toshiro When Ryohei got hurt, we didn’t know who we  could get to replace him Sure How long will you be around None of your business What kind of answer is that! Anyway, how long are you going  to keep following me around I’m done helping your team I have some business to… Toshiro I knew it It is you, Toshiro Grandma Haru… I got to know Grandma Haru when I was stationed in  the World of the Living Stationed I don’t really get it, but… You were doing things like that  even though you’re a kid I keep telling you, I’m not a kid! Grandma Haru can see spirits  the way you and Kurosaki can I see No wonder so many of them are gathering in this place Go away! Here, Toshiro It’s your  favorite candied beans You like candied beans You’re like an old man! Shut up Mmm… These are great! Toshiro Thank you for coming such a long way Sure So that’s it, Toshiro You came here to visit Granny It’s none of your business Fine Huh Oh, Yosuke Were you there all this time Granny, who is that boy He’s been staying  here for a while now A Whole  Yosuke, can you say  hello to our guests Hi! I’m sorry Yosuke is very shy However, he’s the most visible wandering spirit since Toshiro I’m not a spirit Yes, yes You’re a Soul Reaper Anyway, thanks to Yosuke, I’m enjoying my life right now I see Do you have a family, Granny I’ve lived alone all these years Oh…I’m sorry Don’t be Nowadays, I have Yosuke  and many other spirits And sometimes Toshiro comes to visit, so I’m not lonely That’s great! The wandering spirits that come around me are all annoying ones But Yosuke… What is keeping you  from resting in peace Yosuke wants to see snow  Isn’t that right Snow Yosuke got into an accident  while he and his family were on their way to go skiing It was a terrible accident Many people lost their lives His parents seem to have  passed over in peace, but this child was looking forward to  seeing snow for the first time That desire remained so strong that he was unable to rest in peace and I found him wandering about Is that so But according to the weather forecast, it should snow soon Isn’t that great Yes! Say, Toshiro… Is it okay…to leave  that child like that What’re you talking about Don’t play dumb Aren’t spirits that haven’t  passed over at risk If left alone…I don’t  really understand this… but don’t they turn  into like, monsters You’re right If he stays here, Yosuke will probably  turn into a Hollow A Hollow What you call a “monster” Then won’t Grandma  Haru be in danger too Toshiro… It happened right about when  I first became a Soul Reaper I was dispatched before I knew what to expect from  the World of the Living in order to gain experience While I was stationed here,  I simply followed orders and spent every day  getting rid of Hollows Back then, all I thought about was getting rid of the  Hollows in front of me That’s a fine sword you have there My, you’re such a tiny Soul Reaper Grandma Haru had spiritual power and knew about Soul Reapers She looked after me I can see you very clearly today I’m in a gigai A gigai It’s a body for eating candied beans Is that so Then be sure to eat  lots before you leave Grandma lost her family a long time ago and lived alone for all those years And, because she could see spirits, everyone thought she was creepy  and kept their distance from her Spirits were the only thing  that eased her loneliness Grandma Haru thinks of  Yosuke like a grandson Tell me, Toshiro… Did you come to do  something for Yosuke Ordinarily, I’d perform a Konso as soon as I found  a spirit like that But since I left him alone, I can’t allow this to  cause problems for anyone I have no choice but to watch over him You know, for a kid,  you’re awfully caring Who’re you calling a kid! So, you’ll be staying  here a while, right Do you have someplace to stay Well… Then come to my place Huh Karin brought home a boyfriend! -You’re wrong!  -You’re wrong! You two are perfect for each other! Aw jeez! Of all the times for  Dad not to be here! It’s not what you think! Oh, never mind! Anyhow, Toshiro will be staying  with us a while, okay Huh! Oh my! Karin is becoming an adult! Brother, say something! Why aren’t you talking, Brother Aren’t you friends with Toshiro! Toshiro… What the hell do you  think you’re doing What’re you talking about! What’s with your family! They won’t listen, no matter  how much we try to correct them! That’s okay Yuzu’s always like that,  so don’t let it bother you I was just kidding you You and Karin took it so seriously  that I couldn’t help myself But Toshiro… Don’t put Karin in danger, you hear So… How long are you going  to keep following me Why not You’re going to  Granny’s place, right I have nothing else to do Suit yourself My, my, you’ve come again today I told you, I took some time off I see, I see Oh, you came with your  girlfriend again Hi She’s not my girlfriend! Not you too, Grandma Yosuke Toshiro’s here Hi there! You are such a shy child Hey Here You can keep it T-Thank you Tell me, Toshiro… Where did you get that My Zanpakuto is an ice-snow type Huh! If I want to, I can  manipulate ice and snow So, did you make that yourself If you have that ability, wouldn’t things be faster  if you made it snow My powers are not meant  to show off so easily Jeez, that sounds complicated Besides, it’ll snow soon, even  without me doing anything Really Yosuke! It’ll be snowing pretty soon! When it does, let’s  make an even bigger one! Okay! Thank you, Toshiro Grandma Haru…when it snows… Yes, I know That is your job, isn’t it, Toshiro That’s what’s best for Yosuke’s  happiness too, isn’t it Yeah It’s been quite a while now, but it hasn’t snowed even  though it looks like it might Yeah Is something the matter It’s Yosuke Considering when he became a spirit and the strength  of his obsession, it wouldn’t be odd at all if  he turned into a Hollow by now Isn’t it a good thing if he doesn’t turn into a monster Come to think of it, Granny’s late… I’ll go and take a look Yeah I don’t like the idea, but maybe it’s best if I used my Zanpakuto to make it snow, after all What’s the matter, Yosuke Granny! What! Granny! Come on, Granny! Granny! This is… Her Spiritual Pressure is weakening! What What’s going on Grand…ma… Could it be Was Grandma Haru using her  own Spiritual Pressure to prevent Yosuke from transforming… into a Hollow! What is it! What’s the matter! Yosuke! Damn it! Yosuke… Toshiro! Take care of Grandma Haru! R-Right! Damn it… Where’d he go Stay back! Damn it! Stop it, Toshiro! Toshiro! Isn’t that Yosuke! Isn’t there anything you can do! Once he’s become a Hollow… there’s nothing I can do Yosuke! Come to your senses! You’ll be able to see snow soon! Hang on just a little while longer! Yosuke! You idiot! Get back here! What’s going on Grandma…Haru… Toshiro… Yes, I know   That is your job, isn’t it, Toshiro  That’s what’s best for Yosuke’s  happiness too, isn’t it  Yosuke… I’m sorry This all happened because  I wasn’t strong enough Yosuke… I’m sorry Grandma Haru… It’s snowing! Yosuke saw the snow, didn’t he Yes, he sure did Right, Toshiro Yeah Toshiro… I’m sorry for  causing you so much trouble It’s not your fault, Grandma Haru Is that so Say, Granny Would it be okay if I started  coming over to visit too There’s a small soccer field nearby, so I’ll bring my friends too! My, that’ll make things very lively You know, Toshiro… Do you think Yosuke stopped  because of Granny I think Yosuke was  battling within himself even after he turned into a monster That’s why he stopped, I think Who knows I’m done with my business  here, so I’ll be going back I see! Drop by again, okay I’ll keep your name on  our team’s game roster! See you! Yeah Now then, I still have leave days left, so maybe I’ll drop by my Grandma’s  place in the Rukon District Karin’s out on a date again! Yuzu, it’s not like that  between Karin and Toshiro But I see them going somewhere  together every day That never happened before What! You think they’ll get married  when they’re older Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! Brother! Dinner time! Coming! What the—! What’re you all doing here! I invited them to celebrate  the new story arc! Huh! I didn’t hear anything! Knowing you, Brother, you probably weren’t paying  attention when you heard about it That couldn’t be! Whatever But I don’t  have anywhere to sit! Let me sit! And so, we’ll be starting a new  story arc beginning next episode! Keep watching! "

I got a report from Nanao Damn that Matsumoto That was our squad’s  responsibility That slacker! Sorry Would you mind reporting that He seems pretty upset It’s a good thing Being able get angry or  laugh about ordinary things is a sign that peaceful  times have returned True Nanao, I’m done here That completes our share  of the cleansing I’m beat Never thought we’d end up having to erect barriers  over such a wide area Can’t do anything about it It was to be expected after  something as extraordinary as swapping part of the Soul  Society with Karakura Town But I didn’t expect  to be doing this sort of tedious work for an entire month One month, huh Rangiku… Are you all right Of course Now then, Nanao Since our work here is done, what do you say the two  of us reward ourselves What Nothing Just thinking you’re  back to your old self Really I’ve been— Been really depressed! Matsumoto here Matsumoto, you idiot! Do you have any idea how many  times I tried to call you! What’s the big idea with not  making a regular report! I’m sorry, Sir! I was working the entire time We’ve finished the assignment, so Nanao and I were about  to go out for some— Get back here immediately! Oh, come on, Sir! There’s nothing wrong  with having a little fun! We can’t spare the time! It’s always like this! Let’s not fight it Why do you do this to  me every single time! Everyone is waiting for us Jeez… What’s up  with this passageway It’s giving me the creeps I agree But this is the designated path Nanao… What is it Did you sense anything  strange just now Strange You don’t mean a… What’s going on! We’re back Sis! I told you not to leave the room, Kon! Bug off! You’re not stopping me from  giving Sis her daily hug! Hug! Damn right! The feeling of Sis’s kick  squeezing my cotton stuffing… is a moment of ecstasy! You could never under… No, I wouldn’t! Hollow Hollow Man, they keep popping  up day after day Let it go Hey! Sis and I aren’t done— We’ll be gone a bit Behave yourself, Kon You too, Chappy Aye-aye, Sir! Just a minute, Ichigo! What am I to you anyway Why bring that up now You’re always using me when  its convenient for you! I’m not your substitute, you know! What’re you talking about! Ichigo! We have to hurry! Right! Anyway, watch the place  while we’re gone! Hey! Tsk! Hey, don’t you feel like  saying something to… Pyon! Jeez… Ichigo! A Senkaimon opened nearby Does it have something  to do with Hollows No Then that comes later! Kurosaki! Kuchiki! Need help We’ll manage! Looks like Kurosaki hasn’t experienced any changes  since that one time Yeah Kuchiki remained here to assist him, so Ichigo hasn’t had to use more  Spirit Energy than necessary Lieutenants Matsumoto and Ise, you say Yes I haven’t been able to contact  them since their last message yesterday evening saying  they were returning I would like to check and  see if there are any records of them passing through  the Precipice World No problem Give me a minute Hey, Inaba! Bring me the record of traffic  through the Precipice World Yes, Sir But it does seem strange that you  haven’t heard from both of them Excuse me Well Lieutenants Matsumoto and Ise, correct At the moment, we have no confirmation that they returned from  the World of the Living Perhaps they haven’t passed  through the Precipice World What This is becoming very strange It was around here…that  I sensed something odd There’s nothing here Oh well, rather than waste  my free time doing this, I should find me a beautiful babe What the—! Huh What’s a girl doing  here all…n-n-naked No, never mind that Is she alive Hey you! Huh What do you think you’re doing! No, I was just…nothing! Lecher! Pervert! Somebody! Police! You’re making a mistake! You’ve got it all wrong! Arrest him, quickly! Come on, lady! I understand the situation What do you think, Captain Kurotsuchi Well, if it isn’t in the record, they must still be in  the World of the Living It’s hard for me to believe  that those two would remain in the World of the Living  without contacting us Then could they have been involved in some sort of  accident in the Precipice World The Department of  Research and Development monitors the Precipice  World 24 hours a day Are you suggesting we missed them Yes What! You’re going to blame your  subordinates’ lack of training on me Now, now… Responsibility aside, I’d like to confirm that  the two of them are safe I have news to report Lieutenants Rangiku Matsumoto and  Nanao Ise have just returned What! Matsumoto, what the hell  were you doing until now! Huh What are you talking about My, my… This sure turned  out to be quite a farce Where did you two go off  to on your way back Umm… We came straight back  after completing our mission That’s right! You gave me an earful just  a short while ago, Captain! A short while ago Yes… About three hours ago Which means the time  axis is out of sync It does seem something has gone  wrong in the Precipice World I’m calling an immediate  Captains’ Meeting Captain Kurotsuchi, report After a detailed study of the data from within the Precipice World, I discovered a time gap  has formed between the World of the Living  and the Soul Society And this gap is continuing to expand At this rate, we will no  longer be able to intervene in the World of the Living  within the next day or so Captain Kurotsuchi, is  there any way to stop it Of course there is! An adjustment can be made immediately, but I’m more worried about the cause I’d like to do a detailed survey  of the Precipice World first Very well With regard to this matter, I put Squad 12 Captain, Mayuri  Kurotsuchi, in charge of the survey Also, I order Squad 11  Captain, Kenpachi Zaraki, to provide security within  the Precipice World What Tsk! Why do I have to do such  a troublesome task You should talk! Can a barbarian like  you provide security You might trigger a  catastrophe instead What! Shall I start with you! Enough! That’s an order! I also order Squad 6 Captain, Byakuya Kuchiki, and  Lieutenant Renji Abarai as well as Squad 10 Captain, Toshiro Hitsugaya, to  assist Captain Kurotsuchi Dismissed! So… Who is this I don’t know, and it’s a problem If it’s a problem, then  why is she sleeping here! How should I put it It just happened that way Things never “just happen”! Not the blanket! What’ve you done! Nothing, nothing, nothing! I haven’t done anything! She was lying unconscious  looking just like that! Ichigo… What is it I don’t sense anything  from this girl Huh Ordinarily, even if she  lacks Spirit Energy, I would sense something  if she’s human But this girl… I don’t even sense her existence Kon! Where did you find this girl! In the parking lot at third street Just as I suspected That’s where the Senkaimon  opened earlier Then is she a gigai I don’t know Anyway, I’ll report this  to the Soul Society Hmm Hey, Akon We got an inquiry from  Rukia Kuchiki of Squad 13 Ignore it! No time for that right now But take a look at it Huh What is this Excuse me Oh, Inaba Captain Kuchiki and  the others are about to enter the Precipice  World to conduct a survey Would you mind showing them the way Understood, Sir I have communications  with Captain Kurotsuchi What took you so long! I apologize I had  trouble adjusting it How does it look Did you learn anything As I suspected, the cause was man-made Kenny! This is fun! Huh More importantly, are Byakuya Kuchiki  and the others not ready yet See Yes, sir They’re about to enter now Move out the way Go! Go! Stop it! Even with this area being fixated, the Restrictive Current would  still reacts to Spirit Bodies I don’t care if you fool’s  turn into space-time dust, but I won’t allow you to  interfere with my survey Won’t allow us, eh Try me! It appears youre too stupid  to understand words Master Mayuri! Something’s coming! You’re safe! What’s wrong We suddenly lost communications  with the Precipice World, and a state of emergency was declared! What about Kurotsuchi and Zaraki We…still haven’t… Where are you going To Squad 1 We found something important  in the Precipice World You’re saying you haven’t met up with Captain  Kurotsuchi and the others That’s right What is the important item We found it near the area where we were supposed to rendezvous with  Captain Kurotsuchi’s group I don’t know what connection  it might have to the incident This is! But I believe it warrants  investigation With Kurosaki Yes I received orders from the Department  of Research and Development to appear before them with  the Substitute Soul Reaper I’ve never received an  order like that before, so I tried to confirm it Then communication failed It does seem strange, doesn’t it By the way, how’s that girl doing She’s still asleep I was hoping to ask her  some questions, but… I don’t know At any rate, I’m thinking  of going to the Soul Society I wouldn’t recommend it You see, Yoruichi went  there a few days ago She was supposed to return immediately, but we haven’t heard from her It’s not wise to go there  in your current condition Then all the more reason, right I have to go I suppose I have no choice Kurosaki… At the moment, your Spiritual  Pressure is stable, but it will gradually decrease Yeah And the more you overexert yourself, the sooner the day will come when  you lose your Spirit Energy Please keep that firmly in mind Yeah, I know Be careful, both of you What’s the matter Something’s not right Not right You haven’t noticed There’s no trace of  Spiritual Pressure Trace Many Soul Reapers come and  go through here every day Yet… That’s because, you know, that  Cleaner thingie comes and cleans it up That’s impossible Aizen destroyed it a month ago Oh…that’s right At any rate, let’s get  out of here quickly Right Hey, Rukia What It’s coming What’s coming! What’s with that! I thought you said it was gone! I never thought it would  regenerate so quickly How quickly does it  regenerate normally! That I don’t know What! Why you… My Combat Pass! Never mind that! Hurry! Bankai! Ichigo! Are you all right! Yeah…this is nothing… Ichigo! What’s wrong! Ichigo! And the more you overexert yourself,  the sooner the day will come when  you lose your Spirit Energy Crap… Damn it! Hey! Toshiro! Have you seen Rukia She should be around— Don’t move! Throw down your sword, Kurosaki! What Why do I… I’m arresting you as  a material witness! Don’t resist! Material witness! What’re you talking about! Byakuya! Nothing personal We’re not doing this  because we want to either Ichigo Kurosaki… We’re placing you in confinement Thank you for waiting Shall we go then Hold on! We start a new story arc, and the first thing we do is confine  the lead character What gives! No need to worry, Ichigo Kurosaki Byakuya! We will fill the void  while you’re gone So rest assured This is all wrong! No problem Chad, you too! The Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! Hey! Kon here! Let’s get started here with a look back at my legendary origins! I am a Mod Soul originally created to battle Hollows as part  of “Project Spearhead” But the project itself was cancelled, Some scenes may vary from actual events and I was about to be discarded when Sis rescued me Sis…"
" It’s cold Oh that’s right… I fell asleep yesterday after that Ichigo’s not here, so maybe I’ll  go back to sleep in his bed She’s gone! Gone! Gone! Gone! Gone! Gone! Gone! Gone! Gone! Gone! Gone! Gone! Gone! She’s gone! Where’d she go! The typical winter pressure  system will make way  for mostly sunny forecasts  today in the Pacific region Temperatures will be at  average highs in most areas  What the hell are you doing! What’re you doing up! No one saw you, I hope! Listen… I brought you here without  telling any of the people here! Don’t take one step  outside this room, okay Think what would happen  if they found out I brought a young girl here! They’ll think I’m a  pervert and kick me out! They’d do that to me! Is something wrong, Brother  PERVERT My name’s Kon You probably don’t remember but I helped you yesterday What’s your name Where are you from I won’t tell you Huh I said I won’t tell you! Go away! Pervert! Who’re you calling a pervert! Don’t come near me, pervert! Keep your hands off me, pervert! What’s the matter with everyone  Were they brainwashed by someone  No, it didn’t seem that way  Ichigo… Ichigo… Rukia… Hey, would you like something to eat Is there something you’d like Can’t you hear me, stupid! Oww…!! Where… Where is this place, stupid What’s with the “stupid” You’re at my place in Karakura Town Well, it’s sorta my place Karakura Town… So, where are you from How many times do I need  to say to make it clear You don’t need to know Are you not only a pervert,  but an idiot as well Shut up! I’m not stupid, or a pervert! I not only helped you, I even  looked after you, yet… Brother  You’ve been making  way too much noise  Is something the matter I’m coming in… Wait…Wait just a second!  What’s the matter N-Nothing! Doing my vocal exercises I’m leaving for school You’d better hurry too,  or you’ll be late R-Right! She almost found out Perverted freak Perverted freak I didn’t…mean to… Perverted freak! I told you, I didn’t  mean to do anything! First of all, I’m not interested  in little kids like you! If you’re not interested,  why’d you help me I don’t recall asking for your help Stupid perverted freak! What an unlikable brat I can’t imagine Ichigo  could possibly be involved in this incident Yes, me neither But then how do you  explain that evidence What is the important item We found it near the area where we were supposed to rendezvous with  Captain Kurotsuchi’s group I don’t know what connection  it might have to the incident This is… But I believe it warrants  investigation A Substitute Soul Reaper Combat Pass That is definitely the one I gave him It’s unthinkable that anyone  other than Ichigo would have it You’re right But I believe… What’s happening Reporting! Substitute Soul Reaper Ichigo Kurosaki, who was detained as a material  witness in the case involving the disappearance of Soul  Reapers in the Precipice World, has disappeared from jail! Why do I have to run! We’re heading to Hakuto Gate to get us out of the Seireitei! If I give them a good explanation,  they’ll understand Is doing something like  this a good idea It’s not…normally But don’t you think  something’s wrong What did I do, anyway I don’t know, either I did some checking It appears a time gap  has formed between the Soul Society and the  World of the Living Renji! Ikkaku! Damn! Sorry, Ichigo You’ll have to return  to jail quietly You guys too I apologize Our person in charge of the Precipice  World is out doing a survey That can’t be helped We’ve been in a constant  state of emergency Oh, here it is We did indeed record  Spiritual Pressure in the Precipice World during the morning Would you like me to compare it to  Ichigo Kurosaki’s Spiritual Pressure No, that won’t be necessary I’ve no doubt that the  Spiritual Pressure was his Did you find out anything Oh, Captain Kuchiki Thank  you for all your hard work What do you think you’re doing in the  middle of an emergency deployment As you can see… How about you, Captain Kuchiki They‘ll do fine without me That’s nice to hear Forgive me if I offended you Well, guess I’ll go  deploy my men too Wait, Isane It’s this way, Captain Unohana The Senkaimon When we came through, there was a slight variance  in the Spiritual Pressure Wait! Are you sensing something No I believe I need more time Let’s go back Yes, ma’am We have no intention of killing you as long as you quietly  turn yourselves in Though, I don’t think  that’ll happen Tell us one thing, Renji Why is Ichigo a suspect Your Combat Pass My Combat Pass Yeah It was presented as evidence Now that you mention it… My Combat Pass!  I lost it when the Cleaner attacked  us in the Precipice World We found that your Combat Pass was there in the Precipice World several days ago at about the very same time that Captain Kurotsuchi and  the others disappeared What do you mean “several  days ago”! We passed through the  Precipice World yesterday, shortly after noon And are you accusing me of eliminating Captain  Kurotsuchi and the others I’m no magician, you know Wait, Ichigo I’m beginning to understand Understand what The question of why your Combat Pass was presented as evidence even before we left the  World of the Living is definitely a mystery But one thing is clear Whoever is responsible  for trying to frame you is the mastermind behind this incident So you’re saying that guy  is manipulating everyone I don’t really understand  what’s going on, but we’re not doing  this because we want to But if your resistance  means we can fight again, that’s just fine with me! You haven’t lost your  Spirit Energy yet, right Before your Spirit Energy is gone, Let’s have one last fierce fight! Extend, Hozukimaru! Roar, Zabimaru! Why’re you doing this, Renji! Do you really believe Ichigo  could cause this incident! I don’t! Then why! I can’t help myself! I’m not doing this because I want to! When…did he become this powerful If you’re going to stop us,  you’ll have to fight us! Rukia! Stop it, Renji! Ikkaku! I have no reason to fight you! The same goes for me, but I don’t need a reason  to fight a strong opponent! Ichigo! Whats the matter If you don’t fight back, I can’t  guarantee you’ll keep your life Even if you’re the opponent He’s not bluffing! Renji! Why! What happened to you! Are you guys really under  someone’s control! You leave me no choice! Bankai! You’re finally going to fight Damn it Bakudo 73: Tozansho! What! Yoruichi! Ichigo… Kuchiki… Lets go You saved us, Yoruichi We can’t stay here long Yeah But something’s wrong with them I agree The look in Renji’s eyes was  dead serious about killing us Well, that can’t be helped That wasn’t the real Abarai  or the real Madarame I see What! Not real What do you mean! What Were you fighting without  having realized that But…their Spiritual Pressure was  the same as it always was, and… He’s right But they seemed to be much  more powerful than I recall Is that so Well, they are very  well made, after all Well made Soul Reapers require a  vessel for their Konpaku in order to function in  the World of the Living In other words, a gigai At the same time, bodies that serve as vessels for a Konpaku exist  in the Soul Society, as well In other words, the Soul Society  versions of a gigai, so to speak Is that easier to understand A Reigai REIGAI Rei…gai The Abarai and Madarame you saw earlier are fakes created by placing  a near-perfect Konpaku inside near-perfect Reigai Although fakes, they’ve been created so that their  memories, personalities, and thoughts, nearly everything, are almost  perfect copies of the real thing What’s more, I have absolutely  no idea how many Reigai  have currently infiltrated the  Thirteen Court Guard Squads But, I don’t get it Wouldn’t those so-called Reigai  be unnecessary in the Soul Society, where the Konpaku itself  becomes the body That’s probably true for  ordinary Soul Reapers However, there are those for  whom they are a necessity And they are! Reigai are indispensable for  development of, and experiments on, the Soul Candies in the Soul Society Then… The Department of Research  and Development… It’s probably certain that someone  in Squad 12 is secretly involved Ichigo Ichigo! Where did he go! Probably to Squad 12 I’ll do something to  throw off security Rukia, you rendezvous with  Ichigo to gather information Ichigo! Where are you going! I’m storming into Squad 12! Fool! You’re not going to  succeed by storming into the main compound without a plan! We’ll secretly sneak into Squad 12 and gather as much  information as possible! All right North! They’re headed for Kokuryo Gate! Department of Research and Development Sure is boring At least it’s better than getting  some weird additional assignment! Shut up What do you want Who is it Sorry about that What happened to secretly sneaking in Is it okay to use such  an obvious Bakudo This is no time to debate that! So what now Checking the records of past movement  through the Precipice World There should be someone in here that  holds a clue to what’s happening Hold on a second What is it Can you go back a few windows That’s… So it’s that girl Gone missing in the  World of the Living; later found in Karakura Town If she refuses capture, elimination… is authorized! Will you get that, Brother  Okay  You… Who are you people You are Ichigo Kurosaki’s  Soul Candy, are you not You’re very well-informed Huh Aren’t you… We are from the Seireitei We understand that a Soul Reaper  named Nozomi Kujo is here We’ve come to take her with us Nozomi Kujo Take her with you Oh, you mean that kid! You mean she’s a Soul Reaper Hadn’t you heard from either Substitute Soul Reaper Ichigo  Kurosaki or Rukia Kuchiki N-No…I hadn’t heard That’s odd We were under the  impression that you had No, no! I’ll gift-wrap her and give her to  you if you’ll take her with you! So… Where is she now Up…stairs… I’ll bring her down! It’ll be a relief! Hold on a bit! Hey! There’re some people here from  the Soul Society to pick you up! What’re you doing! Huh! H-Hey! Wait! She’s making a run for it! This is bad! Bad! Bad! Bad! Bad! Bad! Bad! Bad! Bad! Bad! Bad! Bad! Bad! What’s with those guys This is really bad, isn’t it! Hado 58: Tenran! Damn! Hey, are you all right You struggled for nothing Don’t think you can escape us Forgive us It’s all right Get rid of him He is, after all,  a  mere Modified Konpaku… a Mod Soul I’ll be going back first Hold on a minute Forcing down a girl against her will I wouldn’t call that a nice habit How do you plan to throw  them off, Yoruichi Are you curious to know Well, yeah I hope it’s  not a risky plan I suppose you could  call it a risky game You don’t mean… One piece of clothing off! And another one comes off! Please, not that! Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! Hey! Kon here! In this installment, I’ll  be interviewing Nozomi! Hey, Nozomi! What do you want, pervert Who’re you calling a pervert! I’m not a pervert! I’ll show you proof! Pervert! No, I was just… All I did was help you  after you had collapsed I’m not a pervert! KON’S PERSONAL COLLECTION!  SEXY DYNAMITE! It must be in a guy’s  nature, you know "
" Forcing down a girl against her wishes I wouldn’t call that a nice habit Oh Ishida… Are you sure about this Won’t your master scold you for doing too much on your own It’s not like Ichigo’s my master! Hado 4: Byakurai A Hirenkyaku… You must be a Quincy You seem quite interested in us I have no interest in you, but I don’t want you bringing trouble to this town Leave Then I won’t have to take action I don’t want this turning into  an incident either, Quincy But if you get in our way, I will be forced to consider eliminating you as an enemy I have no intention of  getting in your way Of course… From my perspective, I’ve already determined  you to be an enemy That’s fine I will take responsibility What now, Ichigo! Isn’t it obvious Return to the World of the Living Be serious! This isn’t the Seireitei  as we know it! As far as we’re concerned, this is the enemy’s den Do you really think you can slip right through the Senkaimon It’s a safe bet that the Reigai have blockaded the Senkaimon Then what do you suggest I do Well… Don’t worry Yoruichi! What happened to the pursuers Do you think their kind could keep up with me About now, they’re in a fluster because  they lost track of me Great work, Yoruichi But… I don’t think the enemy will cease guarding the Senkaimon Neither do I Which is why we’ll  break through head on Head on! They may be fakes, but didn’t you say they possess powers equal to or above the captains! Breaking through will  be extremely difficult! We’re going to break through  because they’re fakes -Huh -Huh I see Quincy, am I to surmise that this attack of yours relaxes the bonds of Reishi and converts  the energy to your own You’re very knowledgeable And I see that your appearance… is similar to that of a  scientist that I despise Are you referring to Captain Kurotsuchi He is my superior officer I knew it So that’s why you knew  about my Seeleschneider No, this is the first  time I’ve seen it The first time It may have been the first time, but I am able to analyze that much on the spot Unlike that person, I  am a composed scientist Regrettably… That technique tremendously lacks enough speed to catch me I am well aware of that It’s elementary There was no question that  Ginreikojaku’s speed could not catch you In that case,  all I needed to do was increase the speed of my Hirenkyaku It seems you’re not very  fond of that scientist What a shame If we weren’t enemies, I think we could’ve gotten along Heavens, no! What! Where’d you go! I’m not fond of Captain  Kurotsuchi, you say Heaven forbid Your wound… He is a wonderful superior He has a few personality  issues, but I respect him However, I was superior in all respects That’s all there is to it W-What do you mean Go mad… Raiku That won’t be necessary I have no intention of giving  you time to figure it out No way… That distance… I never even…saw you coming We’re here So they’ve come… Hey! There are more of them now So they were on to us after all! They can only hold off  the boundary wall of the Precipice World for a short time! We don’t need to attack We’ll bust through them and make it through the Precipice World! Let’s go! They’re charging in All we need to do is keep them from going through the Senkaimon First, we need to slow them down! What’s up, Rukia Rukia! Stop looking around! Damn it! Hyoryusenbi! What happened! I didn’t do anything! What just happened Getsugatensho! Moron! I ended up bursting mine before it got hit because you screwed up on the timing! I can’t help it! That thing was difficult to operate! Damn that Kisuke I told him to develop something that anyone could handle We’re going to keep going  right through the Senkaimon! Yoruichi! Brother! Did you think I’d be oblivious to what you were thinking Did you think I’d be oblivious to what you were thinking Are you sacrificing yourself! If I said I was… What of it Yoruichi! What’re you thinking! Go! I’m not going to get killed  by the likes of them! But… Go, Ichigo! Protect the people in  the World of the Living! Thank you Don’t let them go! I’m not letting you pursue them! Shunko! Looks like the situation  is reversed, eh You are Reigai originally created for the purpose of doing battle Your personalities and strengths might be near-perfect copies, but compared to the originals, you appear a bit aggressive That being the case, you won’t hesitate to attack  Ichigo, Rukia, or myself That is why a single blinding  blow was effective If you had hesitated in your attacks as the originals would have, it probably wouldn’t  have been as effective Now then I’m not letting you get beyond here Is that so Then we’ll just have to eliminate you I see You may be Reigai, but your powers are quite impressive I apologize for taking so long, Lieutenant Kira, Lieutenant Ise I will handle eliminating the Mod Soul I’ll put you out of  your misery quickly So you were still alive, huh His movements… It’s not a simple  issue of him being fast It was as though the moment he moved was somehow cut out I deeply apologize if it seems like I’m toying with your life I’ll end it now Hado 4: Byakurai Ishida! Inoue, heal Ishida’s injuries But… I’ll do what I can to give you time Give her time, you say You speak as if you own time Sado! Now then, shall we put an end to this Let’s end this I’ve taken a bit too long Kurosaki! Are you all right, Inoue Kuchiki! Yes But Ishida and Sado are… Ichigo Kurosaki… You may be Reigai, but you are still captains Is that really the best you  can do against me How pathetic Do you understand the  situation you’re in If you don’t, then let me show you Scatter, Senbonzakura Your denial to admit defeat  is exactly like the real one! So you made it back That was unexpected Who are you I see Was it Yoruichi Shihoin Hey! Didn’t you hear me Yes If you had her help, I can understand how you could escape That is, if she sacrifices her life I said, who the hell are you! Come now, calm down I am Kageroza Inaba I study the Precipice World in the Department of Research  and Development You study the Precipice World! Then are you the cause of this incident And are you in control  of those Reigai there! You even know about the Reigai Wonderful! Wonderful, you say After all, I am a person who has done nothing but research work, so I haven’t paid much  attention to others’ affairs It appears you have  reached an understanding that is much further along  than I had expected Never mind all the explanation! Huh I don’t know what dumb reason you’re doing all this for, but when you hurt my friends… I’ll crush you! That’ll make things quicker If you do not need an explanation, that would suit me just fine What’s with his Spiritual Pressure! As a show of respect for the strength that allowed  you to defeat Aizen, I will not use any petty tricks But is this all the power  you possess right now What! Bring it forth You still have a last  resort, don’t you Substitute Soul Reaper… Now you’re suddenly sounding almighty I was going to use it  even without you asking! Wait, Ichigo! Here goes! Damn it My Spiritual Pressure’s unstable I’ve got to settle this in one shot! Getsuga… tensho! What! Is this your best Ichigo is definitely holding back his strength because he’s afraid of losing his Spiritual Power, but… Even so, to be able to snuff out a Getsugatensho so easily… They may be Reigai, but the fact that he can command those proud  captains and lieutenants shows that his powers are greater Substitute Soul Reaper, it would seem I overestimated you Or is it that your Spiritual Power has diminished more than I predicted Shut up! Unfortunately, in your present state, as a scientist, I no longer have any interest in you! Ichigo! This is perfect You two could become a  hindrance to my objective Allow me to eliminate you right here Hey, Ichigo! You seem to be having trouble there! Renji! What! Let the woman go Let her go! One after the other… Brother! Byakuya! Looks like he beat you up  pretty good, Ichigo Kurosaki Shut up! Are you guys the real deal! Damn right! But…how It’s not just us G-Guys… The originals For a petty underling, this was some stunt you pulled Why Captain Kurotsuchi… I wasn’t expecting  you to arrive so soon Weren’t you tardy  in your report to me Because of that, I ended up helping all these  people I didn’t want to help It’s a thankless job I’m making you pay for this a million times over! Surely you jest You seem to think you’ve  won, but you’re mistaken But I will retreat for now Damn you! Wait! Ichigo, don’t Huh The Precipice World  is his territory now You have no hope of winning if you go after him without a plan But if you wish to die by  committing such foolishness, I won’t stop you It would be a fitting death for you Shut up When I have retrieved Nozomi, I will be able to show  you my true power True power Then, not only the Soul Society, but the World of the Living  will also be under my control Well then originals, and you,  Substitute Soul Reaper… We will meet again someday We won’t let you take control! That was interference  we weren’t expecting It can’t be helped Not everything goes as you  expect That’s science Besides, I knew from the start that it was impossible to  confine Captain Kurotsuchi in the Precipice World  for an extended period Everyone is here We will get Nozomi back… with our invading army! Captain Kuchiki, is  there anything you need during our stay in the  World of the Living I will need a place to live Yes, sir! A garden, a lake, and seven rooms will be the minimal requirement C-Captain And about five or so servants That won’t be possible, sir! Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! Huh I’m saved Is everyone okay! Are you okay, Sado! Hang on, Ishida! Can you get up Yes Grab on tight Thank you Me too, Sis! We should head back for now Got it! Wounded guy over here! Right, let’s hurry I can’t move anymore! Let’s go! -Right! -Yeah Hey, wait! Carry me back too! Give me a piggyback! Don’t leave me behind! "
" Oh! Nozomi Where am I A candy store called Urahara’s Shop There’s nothing to worry about It’s safe here Don’t strain yourself Hey! You looked like you were  having a nightmare Are you okay Hey! Are you listening! What…is this Oh, that’s right You’ve never seen me like this It’s me, Kon! Hey, why were those guys after you Is it because of something you did Oh yeah, before we get to that… You are a Soul Reaper, aren’t you You should’ve said so Not to brag, but I’m pretty  knowledgeable in that area Lame That’s right, lame Say what! I’m not in this form by choice! I’m a Mod Soul, so when I can’t use Ichigo’s body, there’s nothing I can do about it! A Mod Soul T-That’s right Wh-What’re you staring at! Anyway, answer my questions! My loyal servants might  be able to help you out Perverted freak You jerk! What was that for! That’s enough But why! All I did was ask her questions If she doesn’t want to talk, there’s no use trying  to force it out of her But… Ichigo… How long are you going to keep Brother and the others waiting Come quickly! All right I’ll be right there All right then! Off we go to the strategy meeting! You stay by her with the others What! She is being targeted We need to take precautions But… It’s an important assignment I’m counting on you Well, if you say so, Sis Lets go, Ichigo Yeah Be careful! Nozomi Everyone, thank you for taking time from your busy schedules to come here Never mind the formalities What’re we going to do from here on I’ve already sealed  off the Precipice World and rendered communications impossible We must unite before they can form a strategy and return here There are still a few captains who have not been replaced with a Reigai What’ll we do about the Head Captain I have a plan in mind for him Of course, I will need  everyone’s help I don’t care about that I’ll listen to anything you say So how about it Hurry up and let me fight him! Oh, how revolting Barbarians are so eager to use violence What Not that I care whom a barbarian  chooses to fight, of course Don’t go carving them up too much They’re my important test subjects What are your thoughts, Captain Kuchiki There is only one head  of the Kuchiki Clan There is no need for two I see All your wishes will soon be realized Once we have captured that girl With these hands, we will transform the world  into what it should be So much trouble for just one girl Soul Reaper Imposter Crisis Committee Headquarters All right, we will now begin our Soul Reaper  imposter crisis meeting With your permission,  I will be your host Hey! Huh What’s the matter, Ichigo Do you even need to ask! Why’re we in my room! Now, now… Too many interruptions! Get on with it The mastermind is Kageroza Inaba, Seventh Seat in Squad 12 and a section chief in the Department of Research and Development He controlled and studied  the Precipice World In other words, he’s a  Precipice World specialist This Precipice World incident was planned entirely by Kageroza He manipulated time  in the Precipice World so that we would be met by the Cleaner He confined us there, and sent back Reigai versions of the captains to the Soul Society If left unchecked, the entire Thirteen Court Guard Squads will be under his control How aggravating! Kageroza… He lured me to the Soul Society by manipulating the Thirteen  Court Guard Squads During that time, he  tried to capture Nozomi What is he planning to use Nozomi for In all likelihood, that girl holds some huge secret For example, he may have hidden something  inside that girl’s body I won’t allow it I’ll never let something  like that happen again! URAHARA’S SHOP Mr Urahara… Thank you very much for providing us this barbeque  set and the food too Not at all Don’t mention it Let’s enjoy it together later A barbeque Why It appears you’re even  dumber than Kurosaki Watch it! This is Inoue’s way of  trying to cheer her up a bit That girl’s been though a lot I understand Inoue’s intentions, but should we be doing something  like this during a crisis Actually, this activity could  help her open up to us Oh, I see Come on, everybody! Let’s get started! Ishida, would you mind  cutting the vegetables Sado, you get the fire started, okay Gotcha! I get it now Hey! What Goofing off already Sorry… This is your welcome party Anyway, if no one else, I want  you to tell me the truth I’ll help you any way I can Even if it’s something you don’t want to tell the others, you can tell me, right After all, I did save your life! Huh! What’s that That thing you’re holding there Oh, it’s just chili powder Why’re you holding chili powder Oh, I see You don’t know what  chili powder is, do you I’m right, aren’t I Okay! Then I’ll teach you! Chili powder is awfully  spicy if you eat it as-is, and when you put it directly into the mouth like that, it’s… hot! My mouth is on fire! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! H-Huh What’s this all about Don’t you get it You’ve defiled the proud Quincy Cross! But that’s a shiitake mushroom It’s a specially prepared shiitake Eat it with the appreciation  it deserves! Yes, sir Trouble! Nozomi’s gone! What! Nozomi! Nozomi! Found her No Hey! Nozomi! Where the heck could Nozomi have gone Huh Nozomi! Found you Hey! We’ve been looking for you, Nozomi! Wait, Nozomi Where are you going Come back and let’s  have some barbeque It’s delicious! I don’t want any Don’t be like that Let’s go back Everyone’s preparing it just for you C’mon, Nozomi Let’s go back Everyone’s worried Not my concern What’s with you! We’re trying to cheer you up because we thought you’d be scared  after being targeted! And you say that’s not your concern! Is that how you respond  to people’s kindness! Not my concern Hey, what are you doing What do you want! Oh! Rangiku! W-What’s the matter Hear me out, Rangiku! That chick is cocky, violent, goes off on her own and doesn’t  listen to people We’re trying to look after her, but she doesn’t appreciate it one bit! Even I’ve had it with her! Oh I don’t know what’s going on, but you seem to be having a hard time All right Let me handle this Huh Girls her age are difficult, you know Let me handle this woman-to-woman, okay Really! That’d be a great help! Oh, but everyone is looking for Nozomi Which means if I go back without her, they’ll get on my case again It’ll be fine I’ll convince her to go back But, I’m a man A man must keep his promise Come on Huh Let me handle this Please She’s all yours! Come on, Nozomi Let’s talk over there Come with me That’s such a relief If that chick were a little more open, she might even be cute But Rangiku, now she’s… Let me handle this  Please  Rangiku… What about me What! R-Rangiku… Why’re you— Where’s Nozomi Huh What are you talking about I haven’t seen her What Kon, what’re you doing here What’s with him Damn it!  It’s my fault  I let her out of my sight  It’s an important assignment  I’m counting on you  Let me go Let me go! Let me go! Now then… Let’s talk on the other side Now you’ve done it! You… Sorry it took so long, Nozomi! I saw through your guise  from the very start! Don’t interfere! Stop, you imposter! Damn you! Nozomi, run! Imposter Who’re you calling an imposter! From here on, we’re the real ones! H-Hey! Nozomi… Hurry and get away Don’t worry, I’ll  defeat that imposter You fool! You can’t… Nozomi… I’m sorry… I left you alone like that You… Too bad Did you really think you  could stop me with this You sure underestimated me Now then… Shall we go, Nozomi Stop! But before that… You need to be punished  for being a bad girl! Ichigo! It ends here Give it up, you imposter! So this is my imposter, huh She’s quite a fine woman But no match for the original, though Growl, Haineko! She got away Hey! I’m glad you’re okay Of course, it’s all thanks  to my awesome feats Show some appreciation! What What are you talking about This all started because you  took your eyes off of her Why did you leave her by  herself in the first place! Didn’t Rukia make  it very clear to you! Umm…I…umm… Perverted freak No, I… Kurosaki, Nozomi… The meat is ready! Okay! I’ll bring it for you! Jeez… Don’t worry, Nozomi From here on, we’ll protect you Are you people stupid Who knows Nozomi Have some barbeque! It’s delicious! Try it! This sure turned out to be quite a mess Not entirely Having two Marechiyo Omaedas would equate to twice the consumption  of fried rice crackers Having two Rangiku Matsumoto would equate to having two Soul  Reapers who won’t do work, while having two Kenpachi  Zaraki would equate to double the destruction  being done That’s all I’ve heard enough Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers Hear me out, Captain! My Reigai had a wrinkle right here! Can you believe they would  go through the trouble just to add something like  that for a sick joke! That’s not true! I hate to admit it, but  the Reigai he developed are perfect copies of ourselves! M-M-Must replenish my  collagen supply with… meat! Meat, meat, meat, meat My meat! "
" You there, Ukitake Yeah What’s going on that made you ask me to meet you here Something’s been bothering me So I thought it’d be better to meet where there was no one around Is it about Ichigo Yeah Something about this incident doesn’t sit right with me Agreed How should I put it Everything seems too perfect Yeah…it does So, what do we do Yeah… We may need to take another look at this incident from the beginning Both Kurotsuchi and Zaraki, who disappeared in the  Precipice World earlier, returned safely Captain Kurotsuchi, report on what happened  in the Precipice World! Just thinking about it  makes my skin crawl! I will never forget that impudent face! Substitute Soul Reaper,  Ichigo Kurosaki! He interfered with us inside  the Precipice World! He trapped us there! Not even capturing and rebuilding him would be enough for me! Captain Zaraki, did you see him as well You think I’d make a mistake about Ichigo’s presence! There’s the Combat Pass  Captain Kuchiki obtained Circumstantial evidence of Kurosaki’s crimes continues to increase, and he shows no intention of turning himself in  and explaining himself Now just a minute! Isn’t it premature to  draw such conclusions I don’t believe Ichigo  would do such things! Captain Ukitake… I find it hard to believe that Kurosaki is responsible as well That is precisely why we need to hear his side of the story! What naïve nonsense is that! That man is, without  a doubt, the culprit! Even during his battle with Aizen, he was secretly doing something in the Precipice World! We must quickly capture and interrogate him by whatever means necessary! Okay, okay, calm down The Soul Society owes Ichigo Kurosaki a debt of gratitude, but we cannot clear him of  suspicion because of that! Send a team to the World of the Living to capture Ichigo Kurosaki immediately! I don’t think they can afford such a large-scale effort  just for Ichigo alone Kyoraku! Yeah… It looks like they’re  about to move out Open the gate! Nozomi! Everyone else went to bed You should also… What is that! Kon! Whats wrong That stupid Nozomi! Damn! She tied me up all of a sudden! What’s she up to! Nozomi! Nozomi! Miss Kujo! Kujo! Found her No She couldn’t have gone too far We can’t follow her  Spiritual Pressure Is she really a Soul Reaper Ichigo! Rukia! Did you find her No, not yet The lieutenants are also  looking for her, but… Kon says she appeared to be looking for something  yesterday as well Damn! The captains are preparing  their next course of action We can’t afford to be  running around like this! What just happened Looks like a Senkaimon opened I sensed the Spiritual Pressure  of several captains What bad timing! Anyway, we need to hurry  and find Miss Kujo! Yeah! Kon! Of all the times for him not to be here! And I don’t have my Combat Pass Rukia, I’m counting on you! Leave it to me! Ready Okay! Let’s go! You can run all you want,  but it’s futile You idiot What are you doing in  a place like this! How did you know I was here Huh Beats me! I just knew! Don’t underestimate my intuition! But man, why are you so  intent on being alone Do you hate us that much Or what Do you have some objective Well! It’s none of your business! They’re coming! Damn it! Wait! Hey! Come back here, you! Nozomi Kujo should be with  Kurosaki and his allies If we check every strong Spiritual Pressure in this town, we should run into them I already knew that But are you sure about this Our perceived duty is to  capture Ichigo Kurosaki Ignoring orders from  the start for the sake of Kageroza’s personal  request is not a good idea Not an issue Whichever we give priority to, the distance to our goal is the same Neither suits me But since we’re already here, wouldn’t it be fun to  fight with the originals Yes, it would I’m interested in my original as well I’m not interested in you! You! You’re… The originals! Let’s get rid of these guys! We have the advantage in numbers What was that, Hisagi! We always fight one-on-one! This is not the time for… There’s no disadvantage in numbers! Including me, it’s four against four This is the record of recent traffic through the Precipice World Showing it to you is  actually prohibited Please make sure no one sees you and look at it here Sorry about this Ukitake didn’t keep a copy of the records of his  subordinates’ passage through the Precipice World I’ve got to put together a report, but without his squad’s records, we could get in trouble Huh! Just a minute! No, never mind Th-That’s right! Anyway, if anyone sees us here, I’m the one who gets reprimanded Sorry, sorry I’ll treat you to  something next time I’ll be waiting, but not hopeful Well, if you’ll excuse me Bye bye Hey, Kyoraku! Now, let’s get started Here they come! Who are you! Who cares Now it’s four against four! Now we can fight face-to-face  without holding back! Then let’s each fight  our own imposter Huh But I don’t have an imposter, so now I have to fight this guy! Man! What is that Shihakusho And…that weird scarf… Huh What’s the matter That scarf… I’ve seen it before Yeah, you probably have What! I’ll tell you where  you’ve seen it before! Smash’em, Gegetsuburi! Gegetsuburi! That means you’re… That’s right! I am… Marechiyo Omaeda! Huh You’re…me! He’s totally different than you! What the hell happened How would I know! More importantly… Hey, you! What’s with the outfit! Are you making fun of me! You’re so darned ugly that I refused taking on your body! What! They allowed that! They did! And now, as the new Omaeda, I’m going to eliminate  you from this world! What’s with that! That’s priceless! Why not You are ugly, so why not  have him take your place He can be the real one and  you can be the imposter! How dare an imposter take me for a fool! Smash em, Gegetsuburi! Hey! You cant lead the charge without me! Im coming too! Me too! Hey guys, take this seriously Huh! Hey! What the hell His Gegetsuburi is way bigger than mine Naturally! Because everything about me… is superior to you! That’s cheating! Beautiful I’m able to see my form, which I had never seen outside of a mirror, in three-dimensions Indeed, seeing myself  like this is not bad Extend, Hozukimaru! Just as I expected of me! You’re good! So are you! Say, Ikkaku Would you mind doing me a favor What, Yumichika Can it wait No, it can’t It’s very important Never mind Concentrate on the fight! I can’t do that! Huh! Because I can’t damage  such a beautiful me! So please, Ikkaku, swap with me! Not my problem! What kind of movement is that! With your body, it’d be faster if you rolled! Shut up! I didn’t tumble! That  was a martial arts move! Whatever! Hisagi! I want to say you did well blocking that  last attack, but… Why won’t you do your Shikai You’re not still afraid of  your Zanpakuto, are you That’s naïve In a fight, power is a necessity That is why I have no hesitation  in using this power! You originals suck! The outdated old model needs  to step down right now! Reap… Kazeshini! Too easy! What’s wrong with you, Hisagi! Unlike me, your opponent uses the same exact weapon as you do! Shut up! Remember what Captain Kurotsuchi said Reigai possess exactly the same  power as us, the originals, but there is one difference The difference is that they  are more belligerent As the battle progresses and becomes more and more bloody, that characteristic  becomes more pronounced Which means they can go beyond  their limits from the start! Damn! We’ve got to do something Oh…I know just the thing Hey Hisagi, do as I say! What’s the matter Did you decide to give up! Unfortunately no! If you guys apologize now, we’ll spare you! Man, you never learn What! How was that! Why you… What the—! I see Your Gegetsuburi seems to have gotten not only bigger,  but heavier as well When your movements are  that heavy and slow, capturing you is easy! You bastard! I’m your opponent! You guys underestimated us! You relied too much on your power! You call yourself Stealth Force! Bastards! That was a dirty trick! Bakudo 62: Hyapporankan! Damn it! I never thought I’d lose to this pig! What’s up with that stupid  look on your face! Shut up! Hado 63: Raikoho! I can use a technique like that! Run! That Spiritual Pressure just now… Someone is fighting nearby! Why! Did you think that, like you, I wouldn’t be able to attack myself You’re mistaken When I see you, I think you’re beautiful, just the way you do But… Am I the only one who thinks you’d look even more  beautiful covered in blood Just as I thought You look more beautiful  covered in blood I wanted to try it once, but I didn’t want  to damage my own body I’m glad you were available! Looks like they’re about  done over there too Is this all the power  the original’s have Damn…you… What should we do Shall we finish them off It’s a bother, but let’s do that You’re… Are you guys…Reigai Oh, you know of us, do you Don’t move! Shut up! Stop it, Ikkaku There’s no point in fighting  these weaklings anymore We should start looking  for Nozomi Kujo You’re right! Stop! This is definitely odd But who from here would… Oh, it’s you, Inaba What’s with that outfit Hey… What’re you— It would seem this shows signs of having been altered Then someone from Squad 12 must have… Huh What is it! Shunsui Kyoraku! We’re taking you into  custody on suspicion of altering Precipice World records! What! Okay, so that’s how they’re  going to play this The original Omaeda was nothing! I, the Reigai, am definitely  more handsome and stronger! Yeah… Hey, Hisagi! Don’t hesitate to  ask for my help, ok! Yeah… Soon, I’ll even become captain! Yeah… Actually, I don’t really care Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! Now then, about our next operation… Why are you in charge Kageroza is a member of my squad! I’m the one who plans the operation! Operation! -No using petty tricks! -Ouch, that hurts -You guys will just be… -Hey, it hurts in our way! Calm down, everyone Captain Komamura! What’re you howling for! That’s not right! Why can’t you understand this! As I was trying to tell you, that won’t work! You wanna fight right now! "
" C’mon, I said wait! Hey! Where are you trying to go! I’m talking to you! Stop a sec— That hurt! Don’t stop so suddenly! I don’t know Where am I supposed to go What’re you talking about! You mean you were walking around without knowing where to go! Don’t throw rocks! Bug off, pervert I keep telling you, I’m not a pervert! I do have…a place to go Huh But I don’t know where that is Huh H-Hey! Just as I thought You look more beautiful  covered in blood I wanted to try it once, but I didn’t want  to damage my own body I’m glad you were available! Looks like they’re about  done over there too Is this all the power  the originals have Damn…you… What should we do Shall we finish them off It’s a bother, but let’s do that You’re… Are you guys…Reigai Oh, you know of us, do you Don’t move! Shut up! Stop it, Ikkaku There’s no point in fighting  these weaklings anymore We should start looking for Nozomi Kujo You’re right! Stop! What is it, Inoue! The battles seem to have ended Can you tell what happened I’m not sure The only Spiritual Pressures  remaining are the weak ones Ishida is also with them Does that mean the real Ikkaku and the others were beaten Ishida is probably attending  to the wounded Soul Reapers When I have retrieved Nozomi…  Then, not only the Soul Society, but the World of the Living,  will also be under my control Well then, Substitute Soul Reaper…  We will meet again someday  I’ll see to it that he  doesn’t get his way We have to find Nozomi quickly! Right What’s that What is it A different Spiritual Pressure More enemies Who is it this time! So it’s you, Kira Are you here to fight me I don’t really want to,  but given the situation, I have no choice Don’t you remember that you lost once I remember it very well But… Sorry, I’m not the  person I was back then I suggest you don’t take me lightly Just as I expected,  Matsumoto You’re good You don’t seem any  different than before Raise your head… Wabisuke! You are familiar, of course, with  the power of my Zanpakuto, Wabisuke It doubles the weight  of whatever it strikes Correct The opponent, unable  to bear his own weight, grovels on the ground… With his head bowed down  as if in penitence Thus the name, Wabisuke, “the  penitent one,” right But… Aren’t you the one who’s forgotten  the power of my Zanpakuto No matter how heavy it gets, there’s no effect! Growl, Hai— W-What! What did you do! How many times did you block my strikes Three times There’s no way it  could become that heavy! When Kageroza created us,  he improved our powers The original’s Zanpakuto  was capable of doubling the opponent’s weight But my Zanpakuto… increases it tenfold T-Tenfold! In other words, if you  took three strikes, it weighs 1000 times  its original weight Much too heavy to hold If you cannot hold it,  you cannot do Shikai You’re not getting away! Hado 31… For an imposter…you’re strong… An imposter, you say That’s right! We possess the same  memories as the originals, and what’s more, our powers are greater We imposters are superior  to the originals Can you really call us “imposters” Who decides which are real and which are the imposters I wonder I don’t know the answer What I do know is… only the superior will survive This will be a fitting end for you Can an imposter cut this Goodbye, Matsumoto This can’t be! You’re such a dummy What! No! Crap! Growl… Haineko! What! Damn… The Spiritual Pressure  over that way disappeared But there’s another,  separate Spiritual Pressure What! Is she…my Reigai She really does look like me It’s like looking in a mirror It’s creepy Back at you! It’s not a fun feeling You’re right One Rukia Kuchiki is enough I will defeat you You’re the one going down Kyoraku, a material witness! This has to be some mistake! I ask you to release him immediately! Negative Why not! The fact that Squad 8  Captain Shunsui Kyoraku altered Precipice World traffic records is sufficient evidence to warrant regarding him as a suspect By controlling the  Precipice World at will, he can cut off the Soul Society  from the World of the Living If that happens, the consequences would be… But Kyoraku has no motive! Motive That is why we’ve detained him But… Captain Ukitake Decisions of the Central 46 are absolute Once a decision has been made, you should be aware that even captains are not  allowed to dispute it Pig-headed Central 46! You can’t blame them The evidence is there There’s no reason for the Central 46 to listen to you Captain Unohana… I’m positive this incident  is a conspiracy by someone Yes This appears to be a very  well conceived plan Any idea whose work it might be No, not yet It would appear we’re up against someone who won’t give himself away easily But we will definitely find him I understand I’m considering conducting  my own investigation Captain Ukitake, do be careful You must not trust anyone Though it may already be too late She’s not here Where could she have possibly gone Why does Nozomi keep trying to leave Is it because she can’t rely on us Or because she doesn’t  want to cause us trouble Maybe she knows some way  to escape her enemy Huh That’s what I think Why else would she come all the way to the World of the Living When you think in those terms… What would that be Come on, enough is enough What if you get caught by the guys who are after you again! If you stay with Ichigo and the others, they’ll protect you, you know Hey! Why would they protect me Why Why, you ask! Is it for the Soul Society For the World of the Living Not for those reasons! Man, you just don’t get it Gosh, you’re so much trouble! I don’t care what  happens to you anymore! I’m leaving you! Got that I’m not helping you anymore! Oh! Damn it! What’re you doing! We’re going back! Even  if I have to force you! Let go of me! No! I’ll drag you back if I have to What the— I’m being dragged! Let go of me! How long are you going to cling to me, you lousy pervert! Go back to Ichigo! Let him protect you! That won’t be necessary Huh I’ll fix things so he  won’t have to protect me What do you mean That’s why I came to Karakura Town You’re not bad, imposter I’m honored to be  praised by the original But this is just the beginning! She does seem to have greater fighting ability than I do So what do I do  Lieutenant Kurotsuchi! Rukia Kuchiki… You’re a Reigai too! They’re teaming up to attack  Lieutenant Kurotsuchi has speed  I don’t have a chance against  the two of them together  You’re not getting away! I wasn’t planning on running away! She also reacts swiftly  Is there some way I can distract her  Now’s my chance! Dance, Sodenoshirayuki Somenomai, Tsukishiro! Dance, Sodenoshirayuki Somenomai… Too slow! Master…Mayuri… Is this their main body Let that be a lesson, Reigai! Are you all right Lieutenant Kurotsuchi Kuchiki! Lieutenant Matsumoto! Looks like you won Yes Hey, give it up already You’re the one who needs to give up My eye is about to come off! It’s dangling, look! Huh Now what I know now…where I want to go Really Where is that place! That’s really great Okay, let’s hurry and go there! And then let’s hurry  back to Ichigo, okay Hey! Be more gentle! You’ll tear off my ear next! That gate Gate You mean the shrine gate But not here Is there a place in this town where there  are many of these in a row Many shrine gates Many… That would probably be… The mountain I’ve been there before Show me the way Oh, so you’ve finally  decided to depend on me! You should’ve humbly accepted  my help from the start That hurt, you! Hurry up What! Bossing me around like that… It’s this way Good grief, what took you so long We’re going to see Master Genryusai We must report this unusual  incident and seek his judgment Man, this isn’t a very  comfortable place to sleep My butt is sore That was a pain in the butt This is no time for jokes Now quickly All right, all right There are no more enemies  in the vicinity Let’s join the search for Nozomi Kujo Good idea We can’t sense her Spiritual Pressure so I don’t have a clue where to look Yes Your guard is full of openings Kyoraku… Sorry about this You were a Reigai! What’s the matter So easy Too easy Stop it, Kyoraku That’s not our job We have other matters to attend to Kurosaki! I’ve come up with a  plan to get Nozomi’s attention! Really, Inoue! Yup First we get a cat, and then place the cat here, and… Snuggle, snuggle… Snuggle, snuggle… Huh That’s strange, Nozomi’s  not showing up All it did was catch Chad! Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers… You came to Pull yourself together Who’s calling me White garments Could it be Are angels coming for me No, wait a minute! In the World of the Living, I’ve heard there are beautiful women known as angels in white  who care for the ill! That must be it! One of them must be caring for me! A-Are you all right! This…is…bliss… "
" Over by the river, right Yes I’m certain it was the Spiritual Pressure of  Kuchiki and the others Got it! Wait! I’ll go Kurosaki, you look for Nozomi! Please All right Chad, go with Inoue! You can count on me Aren’t we there yet Cool your jets! We should see it soon There Isn’t that it So, what’s over there I brought you here, you know! You could at least tell me! Earlier, you said… I’ll fix things so he  won’t have to protect me  What do you mean  That’s why I came to Karakura Town  Is that what this is about You’re not talking Hey! Wait! Kuchiki! Wait! This Spiritual Pressure… Abarai! No! You’re not him Nozomi Kujo… You know, simply looking for her wouldn’t be much of a work out So don’t take this personally Inoue… Go Sado… I’ll handle this Be careful Hey, Sado! I wasn’t expecting to take you on But if we’re going to fight, I’m not holding back! Brazo Derecho Del Gigante! Relax! It’s me, not some stranger, who’s going to kick your ass! Hang on! Okay then, let’s see how Old Man Yama’s doing Stay sharp He may be old, but nobody can beat Master  Genryusai head on I know that Isn’t that why we’re going together Old Man Yama, it’s  Kyoraku and Ukitake May we come in, Master We have something we’d  like to tell you Enter Excuse us Master, we’d like to tell you about… What brings both of you here You’ve still got a ways to go You allowed your target to  sense your intent to kill You’re good, Master Damn, so you knew all along Now then, young ones… Tell me what you know So the man says Guess we have no choice We have to do it Yeah You’re going to fight me Fine Shigekuni Genryusai Yamamoto isn’t going to lose to  you youngsters just yet! What did you find The Precipice World traffic record here does indicate frequent passage by Substitute Soul Reaper  Kurosaki and Captain Kyoraku Could Captain Kyoraku  have altered the record He wouldn’t do something so obvious I think this is the altered information If that’s true, the only one who could do that is Captain Kurotsuchi No It’s too crude of an MO  for Captain Kurotsuchi Then who I wanted to find out, so I went to the Daireisho  Archive earlier The Daireisho Archive! In the Underground Assembly Hall! Yes Records of all Soul Society  events and information are stored there regardless of whether you want them to be or not I…see… So, did you learn anything I found a Department of  Research & Development member who is obsessed  with the Precipice World This person put together many studies on the Precipice World all by himself And what concerned me the most was that there was no record of  him prior to a certain time What Even in the Daireisho Archive! Yes I don’t know the reason, but it appears he’s no  ordinary squad member Am I wrong Department of Research & Development, head of the Precipice  World Research Section… Seventh Seat, Kageroza Inaba Just as I would have expected Although I thought it’d take you  a little longer to get this far I didn’t count on you entering  the Daireisho Archive Isane! Right! You’re wasting your time It appears you crossed  over both time and space Is that the result of your  Precipice World research You are astute It’s still an incomplete  technology though You used the Precipice World to cut off the Soul Society from  the World of the Living For what purpose You’ll know soon enough El Directo! You’re good, all right! Then I’ll get serious as well! Bankai! Hihio Zabimaru! Hikotsu Taiho! Again! Hikotsu Taiho! Hey, did I make you wait Even though he’s an imposter, you’re all right to be able  to fight this well against me! So this is a Reigai Interesting No matter how high your  Spiritual Pressure is, I’ll blow you away, imposter! Come on… Isn’t it about time you told me What is it that’s here You’re not talking again A Senkaimon Oh… I see A Senkaimon, huh Wait, what do you mean  there’s a Senakimon! Isn’t that something  Soul Reapers open Studying the Precipice World led to the discovery  that many previously unknown Senkaimon exist The one up ahead is one of them Oh And What’re you going to do when  you get to the Senkaimon Lets go Hmm There’s a Senkaimon here I get it now! You’re going to open the Senkaimon and run  away somewhere, right Hey! I’m not running anywhere What Here There’s a wrinkle in space What is this Doesn’t it look different than usual This is a naturally occurring Senkaimon There are countless Precipice  Worlds connecting the Soul Society with the  World of the Living Some are dangerous because  they flow too fast Some are tiny Some are connected to who-knows-where This is one of them If I enter here and close the gateway, no one will find me Oh… That would be perfect for hide-and-seek So, how long do you  intend to hide there Forever I see Wait! Then, are you… It can’t be helped Closing the gateway means I won’t return to the  same time and space Wait, wait, wait! Why do you have to do such a thing! You don’t have to  go that far, do you! Ichigo and others, all of  us, said we’d protect you! Is this what you really want What I want Lots of good things will  happen if you keep on living! Even I was able to  live thanks to Ichigo! When I have retrieved Nozomi…  Then, not only the Soul Society,  but the World of the Living,  will also be under my control But this is the only way to stop him You… Okay, all right! If you’re that determined,  I’ll go with you! What! Don’t get the wrong idea! It’s not because I’m  worried about you! And not because I was worried you’d  be lonely all by yourself either! It’s just a whim! Let’s just say that lately I’ve gotten tired  of this world myself! It might be nice to spend my life leisurely in the Precipice World! Huh! You… What, are you going to kiss me You don’t have to thank me Hey! What’s the big idea! Untie me, you idiot! I’m going alone, stupid! Who’re you calling stupid! Hey! But I do appreciate… your feelings Huh Nozomi! Come on! Don’t do it! Hey! You! Nozomi! Hi there, Nozomi Where were you about to go Reigai! We need you to stop acting on your own Are you going to take on all of us How did you find me How, you ask Fool Did you think you were  the only one who knew of the existence of  this Precipice World What you know, Kageroza knows, as well Let go of me! Now, come with us Hey, you bastards! Keep your hands off of her! I’ll take you on! Come at me! What, are you scared of me! C’mon, let’s go! No! I don’t want to go! Hey! Don’t ignore me! I don’t want to go! Hey, you bastards! No! I won’t go! Oh yeah So that’s your choice Ichigo Kurosaki! You… What the hell took you so long! They were about to take her away! Shut up! And what’s your excuse  for acting on your own! If you were with her, you  could’ve at least let me know! Then give me a cell phone, dummy! Hand over Nozomi Kujo Not happening! There are six of us, and one of you Think you can protect her That’s two of us! I will protect her Why Because it’s what you want! Then you leave us no choice We can’t back down either Let’s get this over with quickly Damn it! Hey, Nozomi! Aren’t you a Soul Reaper too! Don’t you have a  Zanpakuto or something! No Damn it! If you had one, we could at  least take out one of them Are you worried If he were his usual self,  he could probably manage, but right now… I mean, it’s natural to  worry about your friends! Natural… to worry… To fight to protect… your friends… Damn it! What’s the matter Your Spiritual Pressure’s low It’s only a matter of time Guess I have no choice Here goes! I-Ichigo! Your Soul Reaper powers are… Shut up! I’ll just have to make do! Bankai! Don’t think this is the end of it! Brazo Izquierdo Del Diablo! What! Way to go, Sado! Take this! Hikotsu Taiho! We won, but I don’t  feel too good about it Abarai… What’s this Sado, let me have a look at that This is no ordinary Gikongan! Getsuga…tensho! You…win… Ichigo! Your…Spiritual Pressure… What about it N-Nothing! You fought knowing you might  lose your Soul Reaper powers Why Because I made a promise A promise That I’d protect you So don’t even think about  disappearing into the Precipice World Got that Yeah Huh! What! No, I mean… Kon, you’re a mess! Hah! These battle scars  are my badges of honor! Wow… They look awful,  not to mention dirty You can tell the intense  battle I went through, huh It takes courage just to touch you Guess I’ll throw you  in a bucket of water What am I, a towel! Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! Master Genryusai… It’s over Are you okay I’m okay You haven’t been taking your medicine Well you see, he’s a Reigai,  so he hasn’t been taking it Unacceptable! It sucks to be identical to  the originals to this extent "
" I apologize for the wait, everyone I’ll be done with the  adjustments in a minute So we’ll have to pass through  the Precipice World, after all Isn’t the Precipice World completely under Kageroza’s control I wouldn’t say completely What do you mean It appears Kageroza’s control doesn’t extend to the Cleaner You might be wondering, “How did the Cleaner appear so often when it should  only have appeared once every seven days” I came up with a hypothesis Never mind the lengthy explanation What you’re saying is that  he set the time axis of the Cleaner’s appearances  to coincide with when we enter the Precipice World Exactly Astute as always, Squad 6 Captain However, that suggests there are limits to his control of time Otherwise, why waste the time between your entry into the Precipice World and the Cleaner’s appearance So, what do you want us to do I’ve reserved a space behind the Cleaner that is not  controlled by Kageroza It’s a short time axis when you can move inside the Precipice World You will be passing through there I said “reserved,” but it’s  at most thirty seconds or so If your timing is off  and you enter too soon, you’ll become the Cleaner’s prey On the other hand, if you  leave the reserved space, you’ll fall into  Kageroza’s territory You might never be able to leave  the Precipice World again Kurosaki! Are you all right Oh, Inoue! Just barely What about the others We brought them all here We’re treating them now I see That’s good Can you take a look at her too See if she’s hurt or anything Sure What’s the matter, Nozomi Are you okay Pervert! It’s good to know you’re  fine and kicking What are you doing You guys are all alike You’re all lousy perverts Don’t go putting me with him! Back at you! At least I’m not afraid to admit to being a pervert, unlike  like you, Ichigo! Why you… Kurosaki, are you all right Y-Yeah… I’ll treat you right now It’s nothing! Really Huh Kurosaki! Is he dead A tiny kick sends you flying “Nothing,” my ass! You kicked me off guard from behind! Anyone would go flying! Anyway, I thought you went  to the Soul Society! I’m leaving right now Then I’ll go with you Forget it! In your current condition,  you’ll just end up dead Shut up! Try not to get yourself killed, okay He’ll be fine! There’s no way Kenny’s  getting killed! Keep out of this, Yachiru Oh come on! Right, Itchy Relax Until you and I fight again, I don’t plan on dying  even if I get killed! I get it, I get it Hurry up and go! Later, Ichigo Bye bye! You’re late! We were about to leave without you You’re just in time But before you go, I  should warn you that… Don’t need any Let’s get this show on the road Aren’t we running out of time You’re right Okay, watch yourselves Here we go! It appears the captains have entered the Precipice World Doesn’t that mean  that your attempt at invading the World of the  Living ended in failure You’re a smart scientist If they return to the Soul Society, it’s only a matter of time  before they shut down your plans I think you understand that Captain Unohana… You sound almost like a teacher  scolding her student But you’re mistaken about one thing Do you think I’d simply wait for them to come without doing anything What’s the matter Something isn’t right The Restrictive Current! Keeping up behind the Cleaner is not all that difficult by itself The problem is your powerful  Spiritual Pressure The walls of the Precipice  World react to Reishi In other words, the higher  their Spiritual Pressure, the faster the Restrictive  Current becomes Is that what you’re saying Yes, but they probably counted on that But that’s not all it is Very astute I am unable to control  the Restrictive Current But I am able to manipulate  time around it That bastard Kageroza… He set a trap, after all So what We’ll just  force our way through What’re you going to do, Komamura! Leave this to me! Bankai! Kokujo Tengen Myo-oh! You fool! You’ll be swallowed up! Go! Komamura! There! That Komamura… Let it go We can’t go back for him now Besides, he’s not going to let  something like that kill him We can’t waste time by stopping I’ve picked up the Spiritual Pressure of Captains Kuchiki,  Hitsugaya and Zaraki But not Captain Komamura Only a single sacrifice My science is still far from perfect I have much to learn Don’t move! Hado 31: Shakkaho! There’s no hurry, Lieutenant Kotetsu Takaoni! Is that all you’ve got Sogyonokotowari Thanks, Ukitake It’s so funny… What is, Old Man Yama The two of you talk  like the real things, act like the real things, and  fight like the real things But the reality is, you’re Reigai Your intentions are not your own Don’t say that, Old Man Yama Master Genryusai… As you say, everything we are  comes from the originals But that doesn’t mean we’ve  lost what’s important Oh We have our pride Then show it to me That “pride” of yours! A shadow!  Kageoni They’re coming This is going to be good What You’re stopping me No, that would be useless Besides, their purpose is to defeat us We’ll have to fight them regardless But our target is only Kageroza Inaba We’ll split up here and head for Squad 12’s  barracks individually Fine I’ll drop by along the way No objections Kenny, it’s that way! I know that I’m going this way We’ll meet up where Kageroza is The Spiritual Pressure in Zaraki’s  direction…that’s…  Kenny Yeah Hey I’ve been waiting for you Got to hand it to you, it’s as though you could read my mind I can’t Then why are you here I only wanted to find  out how strong I am You can read my mind! Try to get me from the start I don’t mind losing as long as… As long as you’re stronger than me! Yachiru Right Make this fun They’re both like the real Kenny Better go full force Or else… You’ll die! You mean you will! What’s wrong I was told a Reigai is stronger  than the real thing Don’t disappoint me Relax Huh I’m pretty strong, eh Nice try I take back what I said about  not caring if I lose I don’t want to lose  to the likes of you Wait, Isane! Kageroza Inaba… Don’t let this madness  go any further Oh You might think everything  is going according to plan, but killing Head Captain  Yamamoto is impossible No… Not just Head Captain Yamamoto You seem to underestimate our powers What’s so funny This is so much fun I haven’t laughed like this in ages! Reigai, you have the same  memories I do, right It’s just like that other time It’s so much fun, I  can’t help myself! Too bad, Reigai If you really are stronger than me, then I’m the one who  gets to enjoy this fight! Don’t you dare say  it’s over, you hear Not when things are just  starting to get fun Damn right I won’t I’m finally starting  to enjoy myself too! The same thing works  only so many times Iro Oni… White! Not good enough! Kyoraku! Man, this is not easy The objective of these  Reigai is to stop me  But they must realize that even  a draw might be difficult  And yet they’re fighting as though  they’re willing to fall right here  Like they’re on a suicide mission  What does it mean  Kenny! You done I never thought…  I’d be killed by myself  Well, it’s survival of the fittest  I have no regrets  Kenny! What is it, Yachiru  You’re right  I totally forgot about that We’ve been together all this time So I’m not supposed to die What are you talking about I’m also going to take  back what I said earlier About not minding if I lose… Well, all I want to do is win! Even if it’s against  an imposter like you! You make me laugh Kenny You just want to win, you say Now I get…it… Kenny! You’re not dead, are you Of course not I underestimate your powers, you say Don’t you think so I was never interested  in what others did, so it’s hard to say I  understand all of you But, Captain Unohana… Don’t you think the same  could be said of you What do you mean You’ll see Captain Unohana…forgive me I wouldn’t face a  captain of your caliber without a plan now, would I You already know that many lieutenants passed through the Precipice World to the World of the Living to work on cleansing within  the Tenkaiketchu zone During that time, I made a few changes to the Senkaimon leading to the Soul Society I collected a tiny amount of Reishi from the Soul Reapers who passed through that Senkaimon From that, I created Mod Souls  indistinguishable from the originals and placed them inside Reigai That is how I built my invading force The Senkaimon… Do you get it now I’ve already collected your Reishi Thanks to Lieutenant Kotetsu  of my invasion force What will you do now Let’s make sure to take out  the enemy before us, Kuchiki I will be the first one to  arrive at Kageroza’s Slow down First, we must  focus on the enemy before us I will be the first one to arrive Umm… I will be the first one to arrive Fine, already Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! Isane Yes Do you think I’ll lose N-No, I would never… Then come over here If you come here now, I won’t hurt you, even  though you are a Reigai Isane Y-Yes! Isane No!"
" I underestimate your powers, you say Dont you think so I was never interested  in what others did, so its hard to say I  understand all of you But, Captain Unohana Dont you think the same  could be said of you What do you mean Youll see Captain Unohanaforgive me I’ve already collected your Reishi Thanks to Lieutenant Kotetsu of my invasion force What will you do now This really takes a lot of out me Have you reached your limit No, I still have a bit more left Yo, I’ve been waiting for you I won’t beat around the bush I’m here to stop anyone  who tries to pass Of course, if you run away, I won’t chase after you I will eliminate anyone  who gets in my way That makes things easy Bankai! Daiguren Hyorinmaru! Mr Urahara… Everyone seems to have made it to the Soul Society except  for Captain Komamura You can get information  from the Soul Society We’d be at a disadvantage if we couldn’t tell what was  going on over there I put transmitter-like  devices on the captains Mr Urahara! You have to send me to the Soul Society! Kurosaki… What’re you talking about, Ichigo! I can’t afford to rest like this! I want to join the fight! Wait! Let the others handle that side! Look at this! They’re practically dead! They’re Soul Reapers, yet  they’re as close to being dead as you can get! Dead people, Soul Reapers,  and Four-Eyes! Dead people, Soul Reapers, and Four-Eyes! And if your threads start unraveling,  I’m not fixing you  Dead people, Soul Reapers, and Four-Eyes! Four-Eyes! Four-Eyes! I’m not injured like the others  There’s almost no one left  who can put up a decent fight If you leave, you know what’ll happen  if we’re attacked! You’re the one who said  you’d protect Nozomi! How’re you going to  do that if you leave! Besides, Kurosaki, if you  stress yourself now… She’s right! Inoue’s right! Be a good boy and stay right here! Can I ask a question Yes Sure… What is it Why are you people trying to protect me What purpose does it serve Well…because… You know… Who knows Huh I don’t really know myself You don’t know At first, it was less  about protecting you, and more about protecting  my friends in the World of the Living by keeping  Kageroza from attacking you That’s being too blunt In that case, if I stayed in  the Precipice World forever… But… You tried to take everything  on by yourself I can’t let you do that If you don’t want to tell us, you don’t have to I’ve told you that many times before But you knew something  terrible would happen if Kageroza caught you, didn’t you Don’t take it all upon yourself You’re not alone, you know Not alone Hey! Hey! What’s the matter Nothing At any rate, I don’t know  why I want to protect you But I heard it… a voice telling me I  have to protect you Are you an idiot Hey! That’s no way to talk! You don’t call someone  an idiot to his face! I don’t hear a voice That’s not the point You are an idiot, after all I have a name It’s Ichigo This should restore some  of your Spiritual Pressure Oh A form of Kido, eh You’re able to do stuff like this I have a name It’s Nozomi Kujo Right, you do Bakudo 62: Hyapporankan! Bakudo 63: Sajosabaku! Hado 88: Hiryu Gekizoku Shinten Raiho No incantation! Bakudo 81: Danku! Are you all right, Lieutenant Kotetsu Yes What happened to the  original Captain Unohana She is a wise woman She never had any intention  of fighting us So it would appear Huh But why She did not have a good chance of winning against the three of us And, if she had lost, it would mean the end of the original captains’ chances  for reestablishing themselves in the Soul Society Someone who would take that risk and choose to fight us would not be fit to be the captain of Squad 4 Then, from the very start, she… Yes That Kido was apparently  meant to distract us She did a number on us Well then, we need to get moving Sennen Hyoro! Stop it I don’t believe you  would go down so easily I was just going to tell  you the same thing I didn’t think I could capture you with such an obvious tactic One question A question from you How unusual Why Why what Why would someone of your caliber follow that man You mean Kageroza What would you gain  by knowing the answer Well, never mind There is something I want  to protect at all cost I’ll use any means it  takes to protect it! Sennen Hyoro! The same technique again I see now The pillars of ice are to limit my range and stop  me from moving freely Sorry, Kuchiki I will have a showdown with my original What I want to protect, my original wants to protect as well But my original doesn’t  have what it takes Only the power Kageroza gave  me will make it possible Until then, I cannot lose to anyone! Hyoryusenbi! Hyoryusenbi! Bankai… Senbonzakura Kageyoshi Using any means, including  the powers of another… That is how someone  with no pride thinks I won’t lose to someone  who discarded his pride What the—! Are you all right, Ukitake Yeah I’m no match for the  power of those flames Well, young ones Even if I am down to one arm, my powers wouldn’t drop enough for you two to take me down! You are absolutely right However… Yeah! Pathetic! You seem to be near your limits Don’t be like that You’re just too strong, Old Man Yama You did say… something about having pride We have our pride  Is this what you call “pride”! Your noble master… The real versions of  the two of you would follow through on their convictions  regardless of my wishes, but they would never compromise  their true nature I know that very well But what is this foolishness of yours To my eyes, it’s nothing more  than a rebellion by imposters That hurts, Old Man Yama Master Genryusai… Certainly, to the real ones, what we’re doing might seem like a mere rebellion by imposters But we Reigai have our way of following through  with what we believe And what is that We cannot tell you just yet Then… I have no alternative  but to crush you here! This is… My, my, I think she’s here Captain Unohana! You sure seem to have taken your time It struck me as odd that you were fighting for a draw rather  than trying to stop me Why were you so eager  to fight I wondered So this is the reason Yes Sorry about that, Old Man Yama It wasn’t eagerness or anything We knew we could fight to our limit many times over You can understand, right We had no chance of winning against you unless we did that Fine It doesn’t change the fact that  this is a fight to the death Discarded my pride, you say Certainly, it may appear  that way to you After all, we can never  become the originals Even if we defeat the  originals, Reigai are Reigai And that is precisely the reason! That is why I will use any  means to protect my own will! That is the one thing I can  hold with pride as a Reigai! You probably thought I  repeatedly used Sennen Hyoro to restrict your range and take away your freedom of movement But you’re wrong By using Sennen Hyoro to  establish a perimeter, you were forced to destroy it Especially someone like you, Byakuya Kuchiki, who uses  speed as his weapon The ice you destroyed  turned into powder snow that obscured both our visions and created the opportunity I  needed for my next move Hyoten Hyakkaso! You have no way to escape That should have restored some  of your Spiritual Pressure Oh… That was similar to how Unohana treated me once before! Really! Are you all right I’m fine Maybe it taxed your body  because you hadn’t used your Soul Reaper  powers in some time Can you stand up Yeah Worry about me too! Mr Urahara… Yes I can go now Yes…but… If I just wait here, it’s only a matter of time before my Spiritual Pressure is gone In that case, it’d be better if I took  the fight to them right now! Ichigo, you… Try to understand, Kon I don’t! Say something you guys! Stop this fool! We could try, but he won’t listen That’s right He won’t listen! You’re not going to stop him, Four-Eyed Sewing Machine! We’ll manage here somehow And we’ll protect Miss Kujo Man, you guys are hopeless Why are all of you so stupid Go on! Take care of that bastard Kageroza and get right back here! I’ll never forgive you if you don’t! I know Mr Urahara… All right But let me say this Your second entry will be  far riskier than your first Are you sure you want to go Yeah… Damn sure Then let’s get you ready This Spiritual Pressure… What’s going on! What! You’re still not  dead…Byakuya Kuchiki If my Senbonzakura had  been even a moment later, I might’ve been in trouble You are good But as long as moisture  remains in the area, my advantage hasn’t changed There! That felt like a hit Gokei, Senbonzakura Kageyoshi I would have expected nothing less There is one thing I share with you I will use any means to protect my pride What’s the matter, Nozomi You seem very glum! Not really Don’t worry Everyone will protect you! Look after her, Kon! Right! I’ve looked after her all this time! She’s in good hands! Anyway, think of him  as an overgrown amulet Who’re you calling an amulet! Be very careful, Kurosaki I will Get going and put an end to this! I know! Ichigo… Come back You bet I will! Okay, I’m on my way! Rest assured, Nozomi will return without fail It seems like Captain Hitsugaya’s  Reigai has been defeated I know That is troublesome Indeed I was going to give him  the life-size figure of himself and 100 sugar candies  as his rewards if he won I don’t think he would need that You’re right "
" Ichigo Kurosaki… So you’re coming to  the Soul Society, eh Your second entry will be far  riskier than your first  Mr Urahara did warn me  But I have to get to the  Soul Society quickly!  Gokei, Senbonzakura Kageyoshi  There is one thing I share with you  I will use any means   to protect my pride  I knew we would face one another  in battle sooner or later You’re wounded Not an issue I suppose not I would never run,  no matter what my situation I’m going on ahead I cannot allow that - There can only be one Byakuya Kuchiki! - There can only be one Byakuya Kuchiki! Kenny, maybe you should’ve  rested a bit longer You’re tottering Don’t be silly I feel awesome right now Kenny, she’s probably a… I know It doesn’t matter I know what you’re about to do When the leader of the Punishment  Force draws her sword, an execution battle is imminent, right I hope you guys are  going to make this fun! Kill him! Battleshave begun everywhere  Darn children! We must apprehend Kageroza quickly  Huh Shiro… Hinamori Well, Mr Urahara The captains haven’t made it to  Kageroza’s location yet What about Kurosaki He appears to be making good time toward the Soul Society I’m glad No… It’s going too smoothly  Kageroza couldn’t  possibly have missed him  Why’re you giving her the eye! Stop stripping her with  your eyes, you pervert! I’m not you! What Come with me Hey, let go of me! You’re practically kidnapping me! No, he’s taking me away! So, what is it There’s something I want to ask you Nozomi Kujo… Did you notice anything about her during the time you were together What do you mean Kageroza is after her When I have retrieved Nozomi,  I will be able to show  you my true power  Then, not only the Soul Society, but the World of the Living  will also be under my control That’s why we… In all likelihood,   that girl holds some huge secret  For example, he may have hidden something  inside that girl’s body That’s the conclusion we came to But what I still don’t  understand is… What is it that’s hidden within her What is the secret that Kageroza needs that can control both the World of the Living  and the Soul Society Do you have any idea A secret in her body, you say I mean, I didn’t mean  to see her naked It’s the truth! Besides, it’s just coincidence  that we were together I wasn’t like, worried  about her or anything! Anyhow, if she doesn’t  want to tell us, so what Well it’s obvious that you like her Wh-What’re you talking about! You’ve got to be kidding! There’s no way I would like such a violent, smart-ass chick! Don’t talk nonsense! I don’t have any feelings for her, and I don’t know anything! I mean it! I really don’t have  any feelings for her! W-Why Just because What’s that Looks like Kurosaki made  it to the Soul Society Huh This is way off the mark Did Mr Urahara make a mistake  in his calculations I summoned you here Kageroza! I tweaked the Precipice World a bit Why You said you would control the Soul Society and the  World of the Living What are you up to! Why are you after Nozomi! What did you hide in Nozomi! My, my, so many questions Let me answer just the first one Why did I summon you here Very simple To erase your existence Shiro… Hinamori What are you doing here Well… When I woke up the people from Squad 12  who were looking after me were all gone Where did everyone go You still don’t look well I think you should rest No, I’m all right No Multiple battles are  going on right now We might find ourselves  in a battle as well You’d better go somewhere safe Thank you But really, I’m all right You’re tottering Don’t strain yourself You need to rest right now I’m sorry…Shiro I’m so sorry It’s no use You can’t kill me But can you kill me, Shiro Are you going to try and kill me… again I’m really sorry It’s not my fault It’s Kageroza’s fault for  coming up with this idea Awesome! Awesome! Not yet  He… I…was strong!  I fought my strong self…and I won!  My body is still tingling  More… I want to fight more!  You don’t know when to  give up, Kenpachi Zaraki Whatever you’re feeling, you should barely be standing after a battle like that What would you know They’re planning to  attack all at once What’ll you do Then I’ll just have to  take them all out together! Yachiru… Dodge Okay Wha—! He took our attack and  emerged unscathed What Spiritual Pressure! Are you okay, Yachiru Yup How about you, Kenny Nothing wrong at all These guys are no challenge I’m totally unsatisfied Are you going to make this fun for me! Soi Fon! Kenny! Sajin Komamura… So you’re alive Sorry I’m late Allow  me to assist you Assist Don’t even think about it! She’s mine Don’t interfere Don’t worry about me! It took some time to get  through the Precipice World, but my body is tough Who’s worried about you! I’m telling you to stay out of my— Captain Soi Fon! I’ll be your opponent Hey! Did you hear me! Go for it, Bow-wow! You took the fun right out of it I’m going on ahead after Kageroza Bye bye! Forgive me, Shiro Snap…Tobiume Snap, Tobiume! Shiro! Is that me You hurt Shiro, didn’t you! Unforgivable! I…didn’t do it because I wanted to! Shiro! Help me! Bakudo 4: Hainawa! Help me, Shiro! Don’t let her trick you! She’s an imposter! No! I’m not an imposter! Quiet! Imposter! Believe me, Shiro! Stop it! I’m sorry I’m sorry - Snap…Tobiume! - Snap…Tobiume! We’re so sorry This is Kageroza’s strategy We’re weaker than you, Shiro He said if we made you  drop your guard… Then we could defeat you Because you could never  attack us, Shiro We’re so sorry Please don’t hate us for this So you’re both Reigai That’s good What Good Why do you say that It’s not good We tricked you That’s all right Because I didn’t have to get the  real Hinamori involved in this mess I don’t ever want to hurt her again I see Then we’ll make this quick Shunko! We were so close But I’m glad I wish…I was the original You’re way too naïve You were here in the Soul  Society the whole time Yeah I had business to take care of And you I still have unfinished business too Hey! Don’t overdo it I’ll join you shortly Erase my existence Why me Answer me! What! You shouldn’t exist You’re not human You’re not a pure  Soul Reaper or Hollow You’re an anomaly I am unable to create a  Reigai of you from Reishi You are the unaccountable variable Quite frankly, you are  a thorn in my plans Goodbye, Ichigo Kurosaki What the— Is this…the Precipice World What’s wrong Kurosaki’s Spiritual Pressure just… completely disappeared! - What! - What! Listen, Four-Eyes When you like someone, your heart starts to pound,  and you also feel some pain What! You had an experience  like that before Of course! Ive had my share of  romance once or twice That’s terrible! You’re not well We must take you to  the hospital quickly! That’s not what I meant! Hey!"
" This is way off the mark Did Mr Urahara make a mistake  in his calculations I summoned you here Kageroza! I tweaked the Precipice World a bit Why Why are you after Nozomi! What did you… hide in Nozomi! My, my, so many questions Let me answer just the first one Why did I summon you here Very simple To erase your existence Erase my existence Why me Answer me! What! You shouldn’t exist You’re not human You’re not a pure  Soul Reaper or Hollow You’re an anomaly I am unable to create a  Reigai of you from Reishi You are the unaccountable variable Quite frankly, you are  a thorn in my plans Goodbye…Ichigo Kurosaki What’s wrong Kurosaki’s Spiritual Pressure just… completely disappeared -What! -What! What do you mean, Mr Urahara! Exactly what I said His Spiritual Pressure  suddenly vanished That can’t be! Hado 4… Byakurai Hado 33: Sokatsui! - Scatter… - Scatter… - Senbonzakura - Senbonzakura You’re not getting away! Nigeki Kessatsu! Suzumebachi! Very impressive, Captain Soi Fon Despite your slight build,  you took my attack head on However, you lack the destructive  force to defeat me with a single attack As long as your attack  is Nigeki Kessatsu, your target is a dead giveaway By reading the trajectory, redirecting it, and striking first, victory will be mine Will it go as planned Clones! If my destructive force is  insufficient, I’ll use numbers! Tenken! Too slow Not happening! You’re not getting away! Shunko! Ryujinjakka! Bushogoma Kyoraku! Worry about yourself! Very impressive, Old Man Yama You weren’t Head Captain  all these years for nothing Not even all those injuries  will make you go down But your Spiritual Pressure  is gradually weakening If your attacks had the power  they had at the beginning, I wouldn’t be able to heal  these wounds so easily Definitely If we continue this strategy  of wearing you down, the battle will eventually end Is that all you have to say Oh man… Looks like he has no  intention of giving up We have no choice This doesn’t look good The captains who have entered seem to be struggling Any sign of Ichigo I’m afraid not Then is Kurosaki… The last reading I had on him was in the Precipice World, just as the Cleaner was approaching I can only surmise he was swallowed up By the Cleaner No way… That can’t be Just a minute ago, he… What’s the matter, Nozomi  You seem very glum!  Not really  Don’t worry  Everyone will protect you!  Okay, I’m on my way!  It’s…my fault Nozomi… No! Ichigo…  So… You’re still able to move If I can’t hit you with  Suzumebachi’s second sting, then I’ll simply wear  down your strength until you can no longer avoid it! Don’t worry! It’ll take more than  that to kill Ichigo! Oh come on! You can’t believe what I say! He’s right It would take more than  that to kill Kurosaki Yeah Besides, Ichigo chose to do this There is no need for you  to feel responsible Nozomi, what everyone says is true So don’t blame yourself Nozomi, that bastard Ichigo  always keeps his promises! So trust him and wait W-What’re you looking  at me like that for! How…can you have so  much faith in him The two of you are always… I-It’s not that I have  faith in him or anything! We’re not even friends! We’re simply servant and… Okay But, the situation is definitely bad Maybe we should go to the  Soul Society as well Now you’re really  worrying for nothing Yeah Don’t underestimate the captains This is where it ends Tenken! What! I let down my guard I didn’t think you had  that much strength left I will do whatever it  takes to defeat you and go help Genryusai,  the man who taught me how to fight as a Soul Reaper! That isn’t going to happen What The Head Captain’s fate… is about to be sealed Master Genryusai… let’s put an end to this already It’s too bad, Old Man Yama You must’ve noticed it The Head Captain’s Spiritual Pressure is growing weaker Not just the Head Captain… Kenpachi Zaraki, Toshiro Hitsugaya and Byakuya Kuchiki None of the originals  shall reach Kageroza You people underestimate that man What! For the past thousand years, Genryusai has remained as the  most powerful Soul Reaper Oh, damn Taste my Ennetsu Jigoku  to your hearts content You no longer seem to have your speed You don’t appear able to move either True I don’t seem to have  much Spirit Energy left Captain Soi Fon, why do you fight Because this is my duty I see Just the kind of answer I’d expect  from you, Captain Soi Fon But that can’t be all What! Someone who becomes captain cannot increase her powers  without bearing some burden There must be something A reason for you to fight It seems you do have something We are all fighting for that  which we cannot compromise Let’s settle this Bankai! Kokujo Tengen Myo-oh! You no longer have any means  of avoiding my attacks I wouldn’t be so sure I also have my last resort I see But a contest of strength  is what I desire most! Bankai! Jakuho Raikoben! This goes against my pride, but… Genryusai…I am on my- Another large Spiritual  Pressure is gone Captain Zaraki, Captain Komamura, and even Head Captain Yamamoto None of them were able to make it here The remaining Spiritual Pressures will soon be gone as well You can’t fight any  further with those wounds You still won’t give up There is only one head  of the Kuchiki Clan There is no need for two Bankai… Senbonzakura Kageyoshi Bankai, Senbonzakura Kageyoshi Are the captains that amazing Yes But there is nothing  to be afraid of His noble presence… And his wealth! His unparalleled artistic sense… And his wealth! -That’s who our Captain Kuchiki is! -That’s who our Captain Kuchiki is! I don’t get it"
" It won’t be long now Looks like this is the place That you, Zaraki Yeah Looks like we’re the only two left Guess it’s not that bad We don’t know if the  others were defeated yet What are you laughing about We wiped out most of  your invasion force We’ll crush your plans right here! But tell us something  first, Kageroza Inaba Who the hell are you! He doesn’t want to answer Well, it doesn’t matter I only want to know one thing Are you strong, or not How disappointing You still haven’t realized you have no chance at victory Well I still can’t get a  reading on Kurosaki Does that mean he died No, I can’t say at this point C-Come on, he’s okay! That bastard Ichigo wouldn’t die! Knowing him, he’ll probably  just plop right back here! Right! It’s okay, Kon Huh You’re trying to be strong,  but you’re way too obvious! You’re worried the  most out of all of us! Shut up! Me being obvious about worrying No way! You bastard! Kurosaki made it to the Soul Society, Stop that! then suddenly disappeared  in the Precipice World What is Kageroza’s power We know all too little about that man But she knows something about Kageroza Perhaps more importantly, she might even think like him When I have retrieved Nozomi, I will be able to show  you my true power What did Kageroza mean by that What secret does this girl hold Go mad, Raiku! What’s with this guy I don’t sense any Spiritual  Pressure from his Shikai Until we actually cross swords, we won’t know how strong he is I don’t know how you’re  hiding your Spiritual Pressure, but try to make this fun, okay! Wait, Zaraki! Rushing in like that! Hyoryusenbi! Sorry, but I’m not going  to let you do this alone! Whatever! If I kill him first, it’s over! What’s the matter, scientist You didn’t show up just so we could kill you, did you! I’m still alive What! Goodbye…Ichigo Kurosaki Is this…the Precipice World Damn it, I’m losing consciousness Who are you Hey scientist… That was daring of you to take  on the two of us by yourself, but I don’t think you’ve  got what it takes! You’re taking the  fun out of this, pal I don’t know if this  is your true strength, but if you’ve got no intention  of taking this seriously, I’ll kill you right now  and be done with it! Zaraki, wait! He’s waiting for something! Guncho Tsurara! I see You were evading us in order to use that technique just now! I remember now You’re a Precipice World specialist You create portals that shouldn’t  exist and seal your opponents in the Precipice World that lies beyond That is the power of your Zanpakuto The ability to manipulate space Man, I thought you had  some awesome power, but it’s just some cheap trick How boring! Now that we know, that technique won’t work on us again! Huh So predictable! He’s the decoy Hyoryusenbi! Looks like you do have some skills! You took the words right out of  my mouth, Captain Hitsugaya What’re you trying to say! You thought I would make the  Precipice World appear again, so you switched to attacking from  a distance instantaneously Is that a compliment Or are you making fun of me I’ll let you figure that out Yes, I manipulate space As you said, that is the extent of  my zanpakuto’s capabilities No matter how you  change your attacks, they mean nothing if  they do not reach me Yeah I suppose not Guncho Tsurara! Huh! Who said anything about killing  you from a distance! It’s all about setting the table for this one strike! It’s all about setting the table for this one strike! What a coincidence I was setting the table as well For this! What! What just happened That was definitely my  own Guncho Tsurara Manipulation of space… That was how you described my powers You were certainly correct But you made one grievous error My abilities are not merely limited to manipulating a small world  like the Precipice World You might say I can  manipulate all space What! My Zanpakuto, Raiku, uses space itself It records space and recreates it Earlier, I made it recreate the  Precipice World back there, but I also had it record a new space as it watched your attack Do you understand now No, I don’t Still sounds like a magic trick If you can’t fight without  using cheap tricks, then I have no more use for you! You’re an eyesore! Get the hell out of here! Quit messing around! That was… That’s right Your own attack You can even recreate  a Zanpakuto attack What will you do now It’ll make no difference There! Oh I see now…how you use your Zanpakuto You twirl it to the  right to record space To recreate space, you twirl it to the left If I prevent you from twirling  it to the right to record, you’re powerless! I’ve got you! I can recreate the last recorded space not just once, but as  many times as I wish So this is where you were, Kageroza! Well, well, if it isn’t  Captain Soi Fon I never thought you’d make  it out of that barrier I’ll give you credit for deciding  to seal me in there first Naturally… With you out of the way, I have free reign over  the Punishment Force You sure went through a lot of trouble Yoruichi Shihoin… So you’re Kageroza Inaba You’ve finally shown yourself I was wondering why I  couldn’t spot you So that’s how it is It was hard work rescuing  Soi Fon and the others without you realizing it I apologize for putting you  through all that trouble But it had to be done in order to bring everything  under my control You truly believe that you’re  capable of such a feat How silly of you Are you saying it is  beyond my capability Am I wrong Don’t underestimate my  powers, Yoruichi Shihoin I do not appreciate being overrated, but I despise being  underestimated as well In that case, you shouldn’t  underestimate your adversaries either The two of you too Kuchiki… You’re alive You still won’t give up There is only one head  of the Kuchiki clan There is no need for two Bankai… Senbonzakura Kageyoshi Bankai, Senbonzakura Kageyoshi I have witnessed the pride  that you…that Reigai have As I said… The Kuchiki Clan does  not need two heads We will stake our pride  to bury your ambitions That’s all there is to it There is nowhere for you to escape! Give it up, Kageroza What’s so funny Do you think you have me  cornered with so few of you I commend you originals for fighting so well against my invasion force You did better than I  originally anticipated But it won’t be enough to defeat me Your madness ends here! What is it! I’m picking up a reading of  Kurosaki’s Spiritual Pressure! Really! Where is Ichigo! -Are you ready, Abarai -Hey, come on! Please tell me! -Ready! All right, let’s go! You too, Nozomi! So that’s what he meant By the numbers, we’re equal But because they’re not injured, they have the advantage Who cares! It’s finally getting interesting! This is the finale Scatter, Senbonzakura Bankai… Senbonzakura Kageyoshi Now’s your chance! Go! - Shunko! - Shunko! Not so fast! What the—! Sennen Hyoro! Shunko from his Zanpakuto! He says he can copy whatever we do! Can you stop that counterattack We can! Soi Fon! Right! -We’re ending this! -We’re ending this! It’s no use! We’ll cancel his Kido… By spinning in reverse! - Hankisosai! - Hankisosai! Why bother fighting us Your master is already… That was fine teamwork But as I told you a long time ago… You had no chance at victory Do you understand now What! What’s the matter, loser Y-You… Surely you didn’t fail to realize  that I had changed places with the fake one a long  time ago, did you Kageroza Inaba… Why didn’t you create a  Reigai of Lady Yoruichi! Well, when she passed  through the Senkaimon Meow! As you can see, she took  the form of a cat, so I could only create a cat Reigai Lady Yoruichi! Meow! Oh, bother…"
" You had no chance at victory Do you understand now What! What’s the matter, loser Y-You… Surely you didn’t fail to  realize that I had changed places with the fake one a  long time ago, did you Oh come now, Inaba They say “a cornered  rat bites the cat,” but you couldn’t tell  that you bit a tiger Captain Kurotsuchi…when did you… When Now that’s a silly question When the lieutenants  in your invasion force appeared in the World of  the Living, that’s when Unfortunately for you,  my powers are far beyond the abilities of you ordinary  folk to comprehend But while I managed to swap  places with my Reigai, the people who were  supposed to come to the Soul Society to take it  back never showed up That’s why it took so  long to reveal myself Wonderful… Truly wonderful, Captain Kurotsuchi However… Don’t forget that you are  still playing on my field You certainly are a cocky one! Don’t you forget that you  completely pissed me off! Who are you! Huh Kurosaki… Guys Does this mean I’m in  the World of the Living Yeah, that’s right You’ve finally come  out of it, Kurosaki Urahara… Nozomi… Weren’t you going to defeat Kageroza Huh Weren’t you going to  put a quick end to this Sorry… I said…to come back Don’t be so hard on me At least I was able to make it back Which reminds me, Renji… Was it you who rescued  me from the Cleaner Huh All I did was bring you  back here after I found you collapsed in the Precipice World Then… Who was that Soul Reaper Kurosaki, the Cleaner  swallowed you up after all Huh Do you know something  about this, Urahara Yes, I do But before that,  would you like some tea first Not bad, Inaba I never would’ve guessed you enjoyed close combat Did you think you could capture me  with such a weak attack Don’t get so full of yourself That was just to buy some time I see For Ashisogijizo But as I mentioned earlier, everything is under the  control of my field Oh This Ashisogijizo renders the limbs of anyone it strikes useless Ordinarily, you should  already be unable to move, but it seems you want to tell me you were completely prepared All right, shall we give it a test then I’ll keep my eyes closed for a bit If you can move, go ahead and attack me Well, what’s the matter I won’t fall for that, Captain Kurotsuchi When you make a move like this, you… You… You… What’s the matter Oops! This can’t be My body can move… So why It’s this What! I injected this drug into  you with my first blow This drug stops human thought processes Stops…thought! If I had suddenly slashed at you, your defensive instincts would have probably allowed you to avoid my attack But you thought about how I would attack and how you would deal with it You used that drug to  stop those thoughts Inaba… Do you know what a scientist fears most It’s oblivion We scientists stake our  lives on developing and maturing our knowledge  in countless variations Nothing can take its place It is our very soul When my drug takes effect, you will completely forget how to think You will forget how to use the knowledge you’ve accumulated until now Those who stray from the  fixed Precipice World are condemned to wander  within it for all eternity until the Restrictive Current  or the Cleaner swallows them And they die This is something you  are all well aware of Of course, there are several ways to  escape, as Kurotsuchi did But there is no way to be swallowed by the Cleaner, like Kurosaki was,  and survive Then what happened to me I don’t know Huh! After all, it’s never happened before I’ll look into it But I don’t expect  to find a quick answer Man, that’s not helping However, I did find out the reason why Kageroza is so obsessed  with the Precipice World The reason! Yes Kageroza researched a way to control and use the Precipice World, but that was not his true purpose What do you mean I’m saying he had another purpose for studying the Precipice World That purpose was to obtain specific information hidden in the Precipice World Well, what’s the matter What’re you waiting for! Hurry up and finish him off! I will heal you immediately! Not only did he…out do me… He…stopped…my thoughts Today, and only today… I will admit…my weakness If you overexert yourself,  your body will… What about my body It’s obviously become weaker What! Sorry I’m so weak! Oh You can no longer think but your angry emotions  got the better of you That is a surprise What’s this A Soul Candy! No, that’s not a Soul Candy A Mod Soul! Yes Kageroza’s objective in studying the Precipice World was to obtain information hidden  there regarding Mod Souls What are Mod Souls Let me! Let me! I will explain At one time, the Soul Society was involved in a project  called “Spearhead” THIS IS PROJECT “SPEARHEAD”! SOUL INJECT HUMAN The plan was to place  artificial souls specialized for battle inside the soulless  bodies of deceased humans WOOSH  KOFF HOLLOW to use them as advance troops  in the battle against Hollows It’s been a while since  you ruined things like that Ruined what Never mind, keep on going You suck The project was quickly abandoned, but the result was the  development of Mod Souls Kon is a surviving Mod Soul You can’t talk anymore I wanted to ask why you  possess Mod Soul technology Sorry about that, Mayuri Kurotsuchi From the very beginning …I’ve been on… a different level than you people What are you up to now In simple terms, this is  one way to use Mod Souls Surprised In short, you made the  Mod Soul you swallowed just now take the effects  of the drug I injected Yes Well, it’s not perfect yet,  but this is how it is Wait! But how did you find out that Mod Soul data was hidden in the Precipice World By pure chance When we rescued Kurosaki earlier, I sensed something odd about the Reishi that lingered around Kurosaki When I did an analysis, I found fragments of previous Mod Soul development data Kageroza used that data to create the Mod Souls  of the Squad Captains It’s just as you said Nozomi! How did you come to  learn that information on Mod Souls was hidden  in the Precipice World Out with it already With a little more time, we’ll eventually find  out everything anyway Just exactly who are you Nozomi You knew, didn’t you, Kujo All right I’ll tell you He… I… -…developed the Mod Souls -…developed the Mod Souls Developed, you say Stop with the lies It’s not a lie! What Project Spearhead was scrapped, and it was decided that every Mod Soul and the immense research done up until then would be destroyed The Mod Souls I strove to create were to be incubated from a portion  of a Soul Reaper’s Reishi and inherit their mental structure, and beyond that,  enhance their capabilities Do you understand! This was sublime research that approached the realm of the gods! But your research was deemed dangerous Project Spearhead was scrapped because they rejected the immorality of using the dead as  implements of battle Allegedly… But that wasn’t the real reason The very ability to freely control the capabilities of Mod  Souls was judged a threat Correct They were afraid of my research I could not forgive their foolishness Before everything was destroyed, I converted that immense amount of information into special Reishi and tossed it into the Precipice World Then, over a long period of time, he studied the Precipice World and retrieved the information  that was inside the Cleaner So that’s how it was So that’s it That bastard created Mod Souls Kon No wonder you couldn’t trust me No, that’s not true Then what! You’ve kept quiet all this time! Kon, stop… You thought of me as nothing but one  of Kageroza’s creations! Kageroza didn’t create you How do you know that! Because… What is it that scientists fear most You said it was oblivion, didn’t you I agree I could not forgive having my creation forgotten and buried in time Is that why you came up with the idea of resurrecting Project Spearhead That’s right I will rule the Soul Society  with my invasion force What is this Spiritual Pressure! Until now, they were  holding back their power In other words, this is the true power of Reigai! And… You brought them back to life! They’re Mod Souls As long as one retrieves their core, they can make any number  of spares for the Reigai Any number, you say  Don’t joke around Not even you could create Reigai that could withstand this  much Spiritual Pressure! Kyoraku! Man, here we go again This is getting interesting! Lady Yoruichi! Right! What! What! Soi Fon! You can’t expect to  win in your condition Because… The very first Mod Soul developed… was… me Hey Nozomi If you’re a Mod Soul, does that mean part of your  body is also enhanced It’s obviously not your boobs Your arm, huh No wonder  you were strong Pervert! No, it’s your legs! Now it’s a headbutt! Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! You must all be wondering, so I will tell you how  Lady Yoruichi rescued me! I was held captive, and unable to even move When… Soi Fon! Lady Yoruichi! I’ve come to rescue you I was also there with you… Huh! No, never mind "
" So you see… Her family broke up, and Rukia is the only  relative she has left D- Dad! Please let her stay with us! It’s so sad It’s almost  like in the movies! Of course, Yuzu! I’d let her stay even if her story wasn’t like the movies! I think I’ve seen this all before Feel free to ask me anything, okay What are…movies That’s the part that bugs you Wow! It’s as if I have  four daughters now! It’s like a harem, right, Mom The words “daughters” and  “harem” are not supposed to go hand-in-hand We’re a loud family, but don’t let it bother you Thank you We’re going shopping Call us if anything happens Let’s go, Dad And put on your shoes! Oops, I forgot! What is it Something wrong No It’s nothing Another one How many times is that today Nozomi, stay here and  watch TV or something! Hey Kon, change with me! R-Right… Hey!! Inoue…Chad… What are you doing Huh Oh, nothing Is Nozomi home Umm… Yeah… She’s probably bored, so do you mind keeping her company I wonder what’s wrong with Kon So, what is the situation Sir… We’ve lost all  contact with the captains I will rule the Soul Society  with my invasion force  Until now, they were  holding back their power  In other words, this is  the true power of Reigai!  Sir, wait!  If we lose you, the Head Captain, the Thirteen Court Guard Squads  are bound to fall apart We must fall back and regroup  for the time being  However, it’s very hard to believe that all the captains will be  defeated so easily And the transmission Kisuke Urahara received  may not be complete There’s no need to comfort me In any event, right now, other than the lieutenants here in the World  of the Living, the only battle-ready people are Ichigo  Kurosaki and his group We need to prepare for an assault by the invasion  force as soon as possible We understand I’ve noticed Hollows  appearing in large numbers Now that the power balance between the World of the Living and the  Soul Society is disrupted, it’s inevitable that  more Hollows would appear Our fears have now become reality We’ll deal with them with the fighting forces we have left Defending the World of the Living from Hollows is certainly important, but be very careful not to give Kageroza’s invasion force an opening Yes, sir You don’t have to say it Yes, sir What You killed it already Ikkaku, you’re okay to come out Who do you think you’re talking to By the way, how’s that  Mod Soul girl doing She’s… Well, she  did look a bit tired Is something the matter The very first Mod Soul developed…  was…  me  What am I supposed to say to her now Here you go! We’re doing a promotion right now! Oh…thanks Here you go! We’re doing a promotion right now! What’s this It’s defective Didn’t even want one This blows If you’re not going to do it right, don’t make them in the first place Where have you been! Oh… Sorry… Since you weren’t here, I’ve had to stay a Soul  Reaper all this time Hurry up and swap back! Y-Yeah… What do I do with this Oh, the spicy mayonnaise Just mix it into the chocolate You’re not making any sense, Inoue You’re asking me about Kujo Yes Don’t pretend like you  didn’t know about it You’re right I found it odd that I didn’t  sense any Spiritual Pressure from her when we first met When she healed Kurosaki’s injuries… That was when I became almost  certain she was a Mod Soul Her power was like Kido, but it was a different sort of ability As a possibility, I thought it might be an  artificially created ability In other words, a Mod Soul However, there is one big  question that still remains When I have retrieved Nozomi,  I will be able to show  you my true power  We’ll need to know soon Yes Okay, it’s done! Orihime’s special… Choconomiyaki! Choconomi…yaki Does this fall under the category  of chocolate, or okonomiyaki Hmm… I would say… It falls under yakisoba noodles  with special sauce, maybe So it’s none of the above!  How is it It’s delicious Really! Yay! Orihime, come back and make dinner too Huh Can I Sure, sure! I’ll be a father to all of you! Cut it out! Dirty old man! Take this! Choconomiyaki! Hey… Hi Nozomi! Let’s go! She’s calling you R-Right What are you worrying about Didn’t I tell you Everything is going as planned Is it Nozomi It’s only a matter of time No, I’m all right The originals aren’t fools I expected wounds like these I will see to it that the world learns of your wish! How depressing! This isn’t right! This isn’t me! What’re you shouting for Sis! Sis! Please! Punch me! Feel better I asked you to punch me, not kick me Right now, everyone at our store gets a free “I’m the man Lion!” I’m the man!  Hey, Nozomi! What’s wrong Nothing I was just looking Thanks for waiting We’re done with buying groceries for dinner All right! Let’s go home Okay Ichigo… Yeah, another one Gotta go! Need help I’ll be fine! Damn!  What’s keeping Rukia!  Duck! You okay Thanks I owe you one, Ishida What do you think you’re doing It’s a good thing I was  passing by just now Everything’s good Hey! You know, Ishida… Why don’t you come over  for dinner tonight What brought that up  You’re creeping me out Well, Inoue’s making dinner for us And… It’s about Kon… Something wrong I wouldn’t say wrong,  but he’s got no energy I can’t blame him He just found out that Kujo  is a Mod Soul like himself It’s tough for him to go around  behaving like he was before That’s why I figured the  livelier it is, the better So you actually worry  about such things How insensitive do you think I am! Wow! This is delicious, Inoue! This rice! Inoue, you’re a culinary genius! You really think so Brother sure looks…energetic More like weird No energy, he says Are you kidding Well, he was a moment ago Hey Four-Eyes! Are you eating! Being able to eat Inoue’s  cooking is a privilege In fact, I wouldn’t mind him  losing more of that energy for a sewing obsessed idiot like you! Hey Nozomi! Are you eating! You won’t grow if you don’t eat up! Especially your boobs Oops! Sorry! I didn’t mean that! You’re right He’s weird Late onset adolescence, maybe This deep-fried fish rocks! Where’s Kurosaki The way it tickles the taste  buds is out of this world! And this sauce! It’s too good! Question her What’s this about It’s about the reason Kageroza is pursuing  her so relentlessly What threat does she represent With the showdown with  Kageroza looming, we thought we should question her Neither we, nor you, know enough about that kid We thought we should avoid any more casualties arising  from our ignorance This isn’t just our own opinion We’re speaking on behalf of the surviving Thirteen  Court Guard Squads It’s nothing personal You might be right But… She’s got things she’s  sensitive about too I’ll protect her Isn’t that enough Now’s really not the time  for noble talk, is it! Sorry, but it’s a fact that the invasion force wiped out  the captains of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads We’ll be taking on that  enemy here in Karakura Town This time, the casualties might not end with just us, or with you Ironic, isn’t it Ironic Originally, Project Spearhead was conceived to prevent  Soul Reaper casualties But now, many Soul Reapers  have been injured and have fallen in order to  protect that Mod Soul kid You have to admit, it’s ironic You may have a point But still… As long as they’re  born into this world, they have a right to keep living too So that’s it  That bastard created Mod Souls  No wonder you couldn’t trust me  No, that’s not true  Then what!  You thought of me as nothing but  one of Kageroza’s creations!  Kageroza didn’t create you  The very first Mod Soul developed…  was…  me  That idiot! But now, many Soul Reapers  have been injured  and have fallen in order to  protect that Mod Soul kid You have to admit, it’s ironic  You’ve got attitude,  but you’re useless You’re just like me A Hollow! If only…I weren’t alive… everyone would be…  Lots of good things will happen  if you keep on living! Kon! What’re you doing! Hurry and get up! Okay! Now run as fast as you can! No! I also want to…protect… I want to help too! For everyone’s sake! What! You… Is that… Is this my… I thought you said you  didn’t have a Zanpakuto That’s what I thought What were you doing out at  such a late hour anyway! I’m a burden Don’t start that again It’s different from before Everyone tries to protect me… But I don’t have the power  to do the same for them But when I thought of  wanting to protect you… I had a sword What You’re right! What was I so worried about I got all caught up on  what to say to you Listen up, Nozomi! We may have been born as Mod Souls, but dont let that  stop us from trying to live! Yes Huh Huh What’s this doing here That’s… Did you want this Sure! It’s yours! Really! Yeah But it’s defective The mane came off I like it better that way What do you think You’re such a kid! Shut up, pervert! Hey Ishida How’d the dinner go It went fine Right after Inoue finished cooking, I secretly went and  adjusted the flavoring, so it all tasted good Now that you mention it,  I haven’t eaten yet Can I have some— I have no intention of feeding  someone who escaped into his room So you knew about that, huh Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! I believe it’s almost time for dinner Allow me to show off my cooking skills and the power of Ryujinjakka! Oh, about dinner… Here! Then I’ll make some tea I have that too See Then… You’re well prepared, aren’t you Yes, I am "
" No!  I also want to…protect…  I want to help too!  For everyone’s sake!  What!  Oh, you’re still here Dinner is ready you know What’s the matter Nothing You could at least knock  before you come in! Sorry about that Wait, this is my room! You’re going to be late! Hey, wait up! I’m coming in Why Captain Kuchiki… What are you doing Well… I’m still  working on repairing the invasion troops whose  cores were destroyed in the last battle But it won’t be long now How about yourself See for yourself Then… Yes Inform Captains Zaraki,  Hitsugaya and Komamura We’ll be heading for the  World of the Living soon SOUL REAPER IMPOSTER CRISIS  COMMITTEE HEADQUARTERS According to Captain Unohana, who escaped from the Soul Society, the Reigai are immensely powerful now that their powers are not restricted Even the Head Captain’s wounds will take time to heal completely The situation is critical We know what the enemy is after Our only option is to hide  Nozomi Kujo somewhere while we devise countermeasures But what countermeasures Do you really think all  the captains are dead They’re not dead Huh Captain Zaraki wouldn’t  die that easily! But…if they’re alive, where are they You bastard, I’m gonna kill you! I’m going to fight too! Nozomi… Now just a minute! Just because you got your Zanpakuto back doesn’t make you a match for them! Kageroza’s Zanpakuto has the power to cut time and space  and restore it at will But my Zanpakuto can counter his I think You don’t sound too sure What power do you have I don’t remember everything yet But I just know! That’s no help at all! Maybe you can, maybe you can’t We can’t risk everything  on something like that First of all, why do we  have to protect this girl We’ll fight the enemy and beat them! That’s all there is to it Where are you going Discussing it further  won’t do any good! There’s no talking to that guy So, what’ll we do…about her Nozomi, since we don’t know  what your powers are, we cannot allow you,  their target, to fight But my power can… It’s true! I’m this close to  remembering its name Nozomi, at this point, you can’t expect us  to put our trust in you If it’s dormant,  then let’s wake it up Boss… Yes It seems they got caught in our trap Shall we proceed with the next step Do it Since we can’t expect support  from the Soul Society, we’ll have to freeze  the space ourselves It’s going to be a huge job So it’s Kisuke Urahara’s doing I see It appears they’ve  all become separated This plan won’t buy them much time It’s not enough Harder! Nozomi! This intense training is going too far! Keep out of this, pervert! This is the only way to awaken  my dormant Zanpakuto! That’s what you say, but… Shut up! It’s okay  We’re doing the right thing  Did she just… She sucked away Chad’s  Spiritual Pressure It’s working Next! Okay! Over here! Thanks for waiting What’s the matter, Ikkaku Interested Yeah right What I’m concerned about is when the Reigai are coming here Let’s take a break Not necessary! Don’t rush You’ll only fail if you  try to do it all at once You tell her, Inoue! Nozomi, have some of Inoue’s special sports drink and relax a bit I don’t want any! Where are you going To wash my face No sense in rushing things, right Do you really think that’s  going to help you fight Stop already You’ll just hurt yourself  if you keep it up What! But I’m still… I’ll admit that you’ve  got some sort of power But a real fight isn’t that simple Even if you get your powers back, you’ll just be killed I… intended to die But I was told to live I’m taking their words to heart This time, it’s my turn  to help everyone live To do that, I’m willing  to die fighting I have one wish  To fight under him and die  That’s all You fool Living and helping others  live is your business, but you have to be willing to strike, or else you won’t be able to take what they’re trying to throw at you Let’s do this! Come! What’s this Spiritual Pressure Wha-! Renji! The enemy’s attacking The Reigai got caught  in the trap Urahara set in the Precipice World What! But Nozomi still hasn’t  regained her Shikai Anyway, we need to get  her someplace safe! No, let’s continue, Ichigo Damn it! Do you understand what’s  happening here! If the Reigai are coming,  there is no safe place I need to regain my Shikai  as quickly as possible! Yeah, Nozomi’s right Not you too… Jeez… Fine, I’ll help too Renji… No time to waste talking Right! Looks like I’m the first one here Huh You’re my opponent Yeah, that’s right I have no intention of going along with Ichigo and the others’ plans When an enemy shows up, I fight That’s what I do! What was that just now This Spiritual Pressure is…Ikkaku Is he fighting one of the Reigai Ikkaku! Don’t Do you want to waste  Ikkaku’s efforts Ikkaku is trying to buy us time To help that kid Madarame! We’re here to help! Keep out of this! This is my fight! Not that again! Besides, looks like you guys  have your own opponents What! More Reigai Damn… I’ll handle this one You guys take care of that side Guess we’ll have to! Don’t die, Ikkaku! Sorry about the wait! Now there’s no one to get in our way Let’s settle this man to man! You can’t beat me! Oh, you took that well Shut up! Extend, Hozukimaru! Is that all Nozomi! Are you all right You’re exhausted! Shut up! Ichigo, keep going! Gotcha Not yet! Okay! Hey… How long are you going to keep this up Continuing this is a waste of time You need to hit her with some  serious Spiritual Pressure What You’re all talk Time to put a quick end  to this and leave What’s this supposed to be It’s not over yet This is boring I’m telling you that  you’re no match for me Decide that…after you see this What do you mean Just what I said You both say you’re going all out, but you’re holding back  without realizing it At this rate, this girl’s Zanpakuto will never wake up Threaten her with real Spiritual Pressure filled  with murderous intent Unless you stop it, you’ll die It’s as simple as that All right Do it! Hey, now hold on! That’s way overdoing it! I don’t care! Nozomi… Ichigo! Say something! You’re sure you want to do this What! Yeah, I’m sure! This is…the last time! Bankai! Ryumon Hozukimaru! This one’s just for you! Oh Then let’s see if that can stop me! Now we’re having fun! You won’t be laughing soon! What This Zanpakuto awakens through battle Here goes! Bankai! Damn it!  Getsugatensho! Living and helping others  live is your business, but you have to be willing to strike, or else you won’t be able to take what they’re trying to throw at you Strike back… I remember now! This is my Zanpakuto… Arazomeshigure! Nozomi… Nozomi! You done Damn you… I did enjoy that a bit But…now… Stop! Huh What Did you come to be captured Of course not! Rain down, Arazomeshigure! Interesting! Now that’s pretty awesome That was amazing, Nozomi You defeated Kenpachi’s Reigai It’s because of everyone’s help Wait, maybe I’m the  one who’s amazing! Kon! I’m the one who discovered Nozomi Which puts me above her! So that means I’m the strongest! Listen to me! Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! Crap… I left my snack behind You jerk! Don’t bring stuff  into people’s rooms! I forgot my drinks! Wait… I forgot my mirror Look, you guys… Go get them right now! It’s okay, we can get them later! -No it’s not!

So you small fry are my opponents What a disappointment! Are you okay, Nozomi! I’m okay You sure don’t look like it Shut up! I just got dizzy for a second! Yeah, right Your Zanpakuto… How’s it work, anyway It absorbs the opponent’s power, then converts it into my own energy, and redirects it towards the opponent That’s the power of Arazomeshigure That’s one nasty power… that an enemy has to deal with Good work, Ikkaku Not bad, woman! This is fun I’ll take you on! Sorry, but please stay  out of this fight I will avenge Ikkaku You two look after him W-Wait! I don’t mind starting with you, but come at me like you mean it! I know I won’t bore you, Captain Bloom, Fujikujaku! Nozomi, we need to get  Ikkaku to safety! Ichigo! Huh I’m going to help the others! Nozomi! Smash’em, Gegetsuburi!

Don’t try so hard But I’m now able to do a Shikai I want to help everyone Those guys want to capture you If you dash out there, you’ll be putting  a burden on everyone But if I don’t do something… If I don’t do something… No matter how hard they fight… they can’t win against the captains Yumichika!

Tsuginomai, Hakuren! Your filthy attacks will  not work against me My brother doesn’t  say things like that! Bakudo Number 61: Rikujokoro! Nozomi! If her Zanpakuto uses  her opponent’s power, we simply have to fight in a manner that won’t allow her to do that Where do you think you’re looking! Damn it Getsugatensho! Crap… Not even close! Ichigo! It’s time you died! El Directo! Ichigo, your Spiritual Pressure… Damn you! Ichigo! Are you okay, Nozomi! What about you You’re pale as a ghost I’m fine! Ichigo… Hado Number 33: Sokatsui No! Ichigo Kurosaki… I don’t think so! No! Thanks, Nozomi Sorry about that That was nothing I can absorb much more Hey! What’s with that satisfied  look on your face, Four-Eyes! Still refuse to give up You should all be dead by now Shut up! Pathetic Kujo’s powers… can not only absorb the Spiritual  Pressure of Zanpakuto, but Kido and my Ginreikojaku as well Isn’t that right Yes I can absorb anything as long  as its Spiritual Pressure What! You can’t be serious! It’s too dangerous! I’ll do it What! I’ll do it if it  means saving everyone Besides, Arazomeshigure now  does what I want it to do I’ll be fine But… Kurosaki In order to overcome the  enemy’s Spiritual Pressure, we have no choice but to rely on her All right Got that, everybody Direct your Spiritual Pressure at Kujo! What! What’re you going to do! Just do it, Renji! Not under these conditions! I don’t completely trust  that girl to begin with! You can trust her! Kira! We’ve seen how she fights! Nozomi Kujo has what it  takes to be a Soul Reaper If you two say so, then I’ll take that chance Well, Iba Guess I have no choice  Fine, I’ll do it Getsugatensho! El Directo! Licht Wind! Tsuginomai, Hakuren! What! Where are they! Did we get them! You did it Nozomi, that was awesome! -Yeah -Nozomi! -Stay away! -Nozo… mi… Brother! Did you think… I’d be defeated by a  technique like that Hado Number 73: Soren Sokatsui! Now I’ll finish you off! What…the… Old Man! Ichigo, who is that old man Oh, he’s the Head Captain of  the Thirteen Court Guard Squads I see I’ll go grab a chair Huh I saw it on TV The young should give  seats to the elderly So I’ll go grab a chair It’s okay! He looks like an old man,  but he’s not an old man, but he’s still an old…man Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! Today, we’ll be talking  about Kujo’s Zanpakuto Its name is “Arazomeshigure” NAME: ARAZOMESHIGURE CRY  RAIN DOWN Its Zanpakuto cry is “Rain down” It has the power to absorb  the Spiritual Pressure of others before converting  it into its own and releasing it all at once Huh Just for the record, Quincy also possess the ability to take in Reishi  and Spiritual Pressure We’re just kidding Did you really think we could take  Spiritual Pressure just by touch"
" What! Where are they! Did we get them! You did it Nozomi, that was awesome! -Yeah -Nozomi! Brother! Did you think… I’d be defeated by  a technique like that Hado Number 73: Soren Sokatsui! Now I’ll finish you off! What…the hell Old Man! Old Man Is she the one in the report Yes She is Nozomi Kujo The name doesn’t matter She’s just a mere Mod Soul Hey, where are your manners! Didn’t you ever learn the  importance of a proper greeting! Head Captain! This girl can help us! Her Zanpakuto has the ability to absorb an enemy’s Spiritual Pressure We don’t need a Mod Soul’s help! Look, you old geezer! She might be a Mod Soul, but she’s still a young girl! How about being a little nicer… Keep quiet! Hey! Now come on, Old Man! Yes, Nozomi’s a Mod Soul So what We’ll discuss that later Listen! Nozomi is one of us… I said later! More of them Ishida! Chad! Take the injured to Inoue! Right! Okay, let’s go rumble some more Renji! Rukia, Renji! You two stay back as well! But… Stay back In your condition, you’ll  only get in the way Yes, sir You two again Master Genryusai… Oh boy, it’s Old Man Yama again That sucks But we must fight him You’re right All waves become my shield! All lightning become my blade! Sogyonokotowari! Flower wind stirs and flower god roar! Heavenly wind stir and heavenly demon laugh! Katenkyokotsu! You guys certainly look convincing… For imposters Why thank you Your praise honors us Nevertheless, you’re still both brats You need to be taught a painful lesson Render all things in  the universe to ashes! Ryujinjakka! Ichigo Kurosaki! Yes You people stay back as well I’m fighting with you! Stay back! I can’t guarantee you won’t  get caught in the crossfire! What! Nozomi! I will end this myself! The young lady says she’s  going to take us on We better make sure we capture  her without hurting her Yeah You know what her  Zanpakuto can do, right Of course We can’t be careless when  we cross swords with her She’ll suck away our  Spiritual Pressure Damn it! Nozomi, stay back! I’ll end this! You’re scary Darn kids Who told you to… Bakudo 61: Rikujokoro! Bakudo 62: Hyapporankan! Bakudo 63: Sajosabaku! Bakudo 75: Gochu Tekkan! Seems they distracted you You left yourself wide open That’s not like you What’s the matter Your Spiritual Pressure  seems awfully low Shut up! Ichigo… He’s not doing so well Ichigo… Damn it! Where’d he go From my shadow! Correct It’s called “Kageoni” I see You’re a quick thinker That’s right I can’t use Kageoni  unless there’s a shadow But you see… Katenkyokotsu knows a  lot of other fun games For example… This one, where the one who’s  higher up is stronger, known as… Takaoni! But this is not the time for games If our swords touch, my Spiritual  Pressure will be sucked away Oops… Did I kick too hard That’s a relief If I injure you, I’ll  get scolded later What should I do  Should I use Bankai and  use Getsugatensho  Are you debating whether  to use Bankai or not From what I can tell, even if you did use Bankai, you couldn’t maintain it for long I’m guessing you can only unleash Getsugatensho two, maybe  three, more times at most Damn you! Iro Oni… Black! Nozomi!  I have no time to hesitate!  Bankai! Getsugatensho! When you fight, you need to understand  your opponent’s powers You don’t want to waste a good attack Your Spiritual Pressure  dropped again it would seem This is bad…real bad! Calm down! How can I stay calm! Both Ichigo and Nozomi are in trouble! I can’t do anything to help them I’ll go Me too You can’t! You can’t do anything  in your condition! Just keep still! Shut up! Your attack, Sis, is as crisp as ever But you still can’t go You heard the old geezer! You’ll only get in the way! But sometimes you still have to go Rukia’s right If we can get in even a single strike… What the—! What’s the matter! This Spiritual Pressure… What! This can’t be! Didn’t you already know A Bakudo like that would do nothing more than stall him for a moment You’re… Surely you didn’t misjudge the power of Genryusai Yamamoto, who has served for a millennium as Head Captain of the Thirteen  Court Guard Squads, did you Crap! Get down! Ichigo! Nozomi! Ichigo! Nozomi! Hey… Damn you! What was that for, old geezer! Where’s Ichigo! Did he get caught in that blast! Over there! That was close Too close for comfort Hey, old geezer! Stop that! But Sis… The existence of Mod Souls is a bitter legacy in the  Soul Society’s past His intention may have been to eliminate Nozomi along with Kageroza What kind of an excuse is that! He wouldn’t… Perhaps eliminating me is an effective way to  stop Kageroza’s plans That’s not true Yes, it is But…I’m not going to die! You’re damn right Let go already I’m fine Oh, sorry Old Man Yama… Master… You may be imposters, but you wield the powers  of my students well I didn’t think you’d  still be standing That will be enough Everyone, thank you for your hard work Now please step back I will do the rest You’re… Kageroza Inaba! You are everything I expected,  Head Captain Yamamoto Even the power of the captains together could not hold you down Still, everything is going as planned I will take Nozomi now I need her to fulfill my wish Old Man! You can’t attack that guy recklessly Who do you think you’re  talking to, kid You think I don’t know  what his abilities are Umm… If you know, then the more  reason you should be careful Yes, it certainly would be a  problem if he copies my techniques Then what will you do Attack in a way that won’t  allow him to do that, I suppose Yeah, but… I’ll be your decoy Are you crazy! It’s okay It’s the least I can do But… I want to do it Please Nozomi… Old Man Fine Nozomi! What’s she up to I can’t see her coming to  allow herself to be captured You want to cross swords so you can absorb my Spiritual Pressure Sorry, I won’t fall for that It’s futile When did you… But this won’t be enough! It’s futile! Negate! With every last ounce of  my Spiritual Pressure! Substitute Soul Reaper! Getsuga…tensho! Ichigo! He did it! Did I…get him Ichigo! Ichigo! That nearly…got me Why! I-Ichigo! It means that… my judgment won! Ryujinjakka is certainly  a frightening power But at that very moment I transferred Nozomi’s  abilities to myself… and absorbed both your powers Now, my Raiku has the powers of both Head  Captain Yamamoto’s Ryujinjakka and the Substitute Soul  Reaper’s Getsugatensho! As strong as you are, Head Captain… You cannot remain unscathed  after an attack with such power! The time has come! This ends right now! Oh no! Head Captain! Young lady! This…can’t be! That man, Kageroza… His mysterious nature scares me Sis! They say embracing something  soft in your arms will help ease your worries! Something like me! Now come on! Phew… I feel much better now! Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! Inoue! Look after their wounds! I’ll go and get the  last injured person Huh Isn’t this everyone No, I’m certain there was one more No, we have everyone I’m positive! "
" Now, my Raiku has the powers of both Head  Captain Yamamoto’s Ryujinjakka and the Substitute Soul  Reaper’s Getsugatensho! As strong as you are, Head Captain… You cannot remain unscathed after  an attack with such power! The time has come! This ends right now! Oh no! Head Captain! Young lady! This…can’t be! Nozomi! Stop! It’s too much for you! This young lady… Is she trying to protect me You can’t absorb any more! Get away, Nozomi! Please stop! You’ll die! Out of the way! Nozomi… Head Captain! Old geezer! Get a hold of yourself, Head Captain! Nozomi! Totally ignored me Why Why what Why did you protect a Mod Soul like me Don’t get the wrong idea you fool! It’ll take more than a thousand years before I need to be protected by you! Besides… You may be a Mod Soul, but you’re just a young girl Be a bit more honest with her! Old geezer! Head Captain! Hey! Old geezer! Are you all right! Head Captain… Already! Rukia! He’s coming! Right! Where’s Kageroza Ichigo… Over there Kageroza… The bastard won’t stay down Nozomi, you’re okay Thank goodness It won’t do any good, Nozomi You can’t fight with that Zanpakuto Substitute Soul Reaper… Why do you try to stop me Because Nozomi doesn’t  want to go with you That’s why! Doesn’t want to go Why Why do you say that What What the hell is with you! Of course she doesn’t  want to go with you! Nozomi’s creator… In other words, Nozomi’s father The research is about to be complete Complete You mean taking over  the World of the Living and the Soul Society! We won’t allow that! That wouldn’t make Nozomi happy! Won’t it It would make me happy So Nozomi should be happy, as well Stop spouting nonsense! Nozomi’s not like you! Forgive me What’s so funny! You You talk as though you  understand Nozomi Unfortunately for you, no one understands Nozomi better than I do Huh! What’re you talking about It’s simple, really Simply put, Nozomi and I were born from the Reishi  of a single Soul Reaper W-What’s that mean! Exactly what it sounded like Hey, Nozomi! What the hell is he talking about! I don’t get it! At least say something! Come on, Nozomi! Hey! Answer me! It seems you haven’t forgotten Hey! Quit laughing at every little thing! You see… Nozomi always knew If she was captured,  we would become one That she would become your enemy That’s why she tried  to keep her distance You tried to push everyone away Didn’t you, Nozomi But then, you began to feel an attachment to these people  who tried to protect you What’s your name  Where are you from  I won’t tell you  Go away! Pervert!  Keep your hands off me, pervert!  Not my concern  Don’t worry, Nozomi  From here on, we’ll protect you  That won’t be necessary  I’ll fix things so he  won’t have to protect me  If I enter here and close the gateway, no one will find me Ichigo and the others, all of  us, said we’d protect you!  Is this what you really want  Lots of good things will happen  if you keep on living!  You guys are all alike  You’re all lousy perverts  Don’t go putting me with him!  At any rate, I don’t know  why I want to protect you  But I heard it… a voice telling me I  have to protect you You are an idiot, after all  I’m a burden  Everyone tries to protect me…  But I don’t have the power  to do the same for them  But when I thought of  wanting to protect you…  I had a sword  That’s why she couldn’t  tell you anything! You nerdy bastard! Quit mouthing off like  you know everything! Don’t go telling  Nozomi how she feels! Mod Soul… Nozomi is me, and I am Nozomi Ask Nozomi herself if what  I am saying is true Nozomi… You bastard! I said not to laugh! Ichigo… Kageroza! You don’t understand anything! Ichigo! You idiot! You plan on fighting  me in that condition However… It’s futile in your  current condition! Damn it! Nozomi… Come, we’re going back to where we belong! To how we should be! Come on, let’s go No I don’t want to go! I see How unfortunate In that case, I’ll take you by force! Damn it! You bastard! Stupid bastard! Come! -You… -No! -Damn it! No… Take this, you! Nozomi! What! Now’s your chance! Run! What Get away, you! What’re you waiting for! Run! Get away, Nozomi! Damn you! You’re a Mod Soul, but you’re a total failure! I’ll eliminate you  completely from both the World of the Living  and the Soul Society! You pathetic fool! Tenran! Kon! Nozomi! What! Genryusai Yamamoto! Sorry, I don’t have  time for you now Come back here! You saved my life! Thank you! I was so scared! Even now, you still have your guard up Behind you! How foolish What’s the matter You…get away now What’re you saying We’re going together! I can’t run anymore But you can make it alone I’m not going without you! Come on! Get up! Run! Come on, hurry! Get up! Come on! Man, you’re heavy! Come on! Kon… Huh You told me once before…to live Now it’s my turn Live What about you! No! We’re going together! I’ll be okay I promise I won’t die But… No! We’re not doing it that way! I’m getting away together with you! You’re such a stupid pervert Nozomi… Shitotsusansen Huh! Why Hey, Nozomi! Why’re you doing this to me! That’s… My Spiritual Pressure’s… Hang in there for just one more attack Nozomi, I have you now! Nozomi! Get down, Nozomi! It’s gone! Please… Just one is enough Getsugatensho! Ichigo… I’m okay Let’s go back… To where we belong Impossible How did you… I took out a little insurance Back when I slipped near the slopes My Raiku is even capable  of replicating myself! What The me you defeated was  nothing more than a replica Goodbye Ichigo! Nozomi… Let’s go back… to where we belong Nozomi! Nozomi! Nozomi! Nozomi… Why do that for me! Why do I always end  up getting protected, and not able to do anything! There’s no point for  me to live like that! Damn it! Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! Boss! We’ve completed freezed the space All right, then let’s go and help  rescue Kurosaki and the others Just a minute! Zaraki and Madarame’s Spiritual  Pressures have produced a fissure! That’s not good! We’ll need to deal with that first! Whoa! Now the protective barrier was destroyed due to Miss Nozomi’s technique! What! The Head Captain and Kurosaki’s  combined techniques opened a huge hole in space! I didn’t make it in time "
" We lost  Did…  we lose  You’ve come to, Kurosaki Mr Urahara… Was I… You’re all right You weren’t unconscious all that long Maybe a half-day after you collapsed I see What about the others They’re not completely recovered yet, but slowly getting better  thanks to Inoue’s efforts I see I didn’t want to worry your family, so I had you brought here to my place Was that okay with you Yeah I appreciate it For now, please concentrate  on making a full recovery We’ll plan what to do next after that I’ll make you some tea Mr Urahara… Did I…lose…my Spiritual Pressure Yes That means I can’t help  Nozomi anymore, doesn’t it I lost to that guyto Kageroza Well, I really couldn’t say He’s past the worst of it Head Captain Yamamoto won’t be returning to battle  any time soon, though Is that so How are the others They’re still touch-and-go Third Seat Madarame and  Fifth Seat Ayasegawa’s wounds, in particular, are severe and still show  no signs of getting better I see Sometimes it just takes time We’ll just have to do the best we can What…should we do That bastard has to be pretty  badly wounded himself So I’ll… Are you going alone, Lieutenant Abarai Knowing him, he’s probably already regrouped his invasion force in the Soul Society But… I sympathize with you And I share your desire to  save that Mod Soul girl But right now, all I can tell you from my position is  to stand by and wait Yes, ma’am Huh Are you leaving, Kurosaki Staying here isn’t  going to help anything Kurosaki… Why don’t we take a little walk This place…  What! Then how about karaoke Huh Just the two of us You don’t like that I’m fine, but… Then how about I invite Atsuko  and the others, and well party Then can I also call over Yoshie Sure I’m…powerless  I can’t even protect myself  Say, Mr Urahara… Yes My Spiritual Pressure… Is there any way to get it back Kurosaki You guys Ichigo… Why the long faces Huh Is it because I lost my Spirit Energy If that’s the case,  don’t worry about it Right now, we have to rescue Nozomi, even though I can’t fight anymore But I’ll help any way I can Kurosaki…  Hey, Ichigo! Huh What How come I can… Of course you can see us We’re in Gigai Oh…right… Sheesh… We came because we were worried  how you were holding up, but you look just fine You got a problem with that Ichigo Sorry… As you know, I lost my Spirit Energy But I haven’t lost my soul I might have to leave the  fighting to you guys But that doesn’t mean I’ve given up! Are you a moron or something Huh You’re not the only one who’s  dealing with this incident, you know Yeah, but… And, did you think we  thought you had given up That’s right If you gave up, who are we  supposed to follow around You fool Thanks, guys What’re you thanking us for! Ouch! You jerk! I don’t have Spirit Energy, you know! What does that have to do with this! Come on! You could be a little more gentle Hey! What’re you nodding for! Are you a moron or something You already said that! Are you all right You need immediate treatment Keep your hands off of me! I will now begin the fusion  of Nozomi and myself Begin the preparations But in your condition, there might be excessive  post-fusion stress on the Reigai Silence! Silence… Silence! He is waiting Nozomi and I must become what we were meant to  be as soon as possible! At any rate, we must break in to the  Soul Society quickly Kageroza now has Kujo But that also means his attention  has shifted away from us Realistically, the people we have  here are our entire fighting force Against their invasion force, we’d be at a disadvantage  with or without you, Ichigo So relax, Ichigo I can’t Wait… Can we really say that Kurosaki’s  presence doesn’t matter Huh We now know why Kageroza came  after Nozomi so tenaciously But it’s been bothering me Why was he wary of Kurosaki as well Wasn’t it because Kurosaki  was always near Nozomi That’s part of it, I’m sure But the biggest reason was  Kurosaki’s Hollow powers Hollow powers Yes Kageroza is able to create  a Soul Reaper’s Reigai with just a tiny amount of Reishi But he never created  a Reigai of Kurosaki He remained wary of him and personally faced off against  him numerous times, suggesting that Kageroza  lacks the capability to create a Reigai of Kurosaki In other words, Kageroza cannot  manipulate Hollow powers and that’s why he was  always wary of Ichigo Is that what you’re saying Yes And that’s why he used the Precipice World to have  the Cleaner attack Ichigo Yeah I did get attacked twice Twice Yeah The first time was when I  went in with you, Rukia I dropped my Combat Pass, remember Your Combat Pass… The second time was when I tried  to re-enter the Soul Society I was swallowed up by the Cleaner But how did I survive I see now Perhaps that’s what happened Kurosaki… We might be able to restore  your Spiritual Pressure Are you serious Restore Ichigo’s Spiritual Pressure What are you talking about This is ultimately just a theory, but… The Cleaner reacts to Reishi  and swallows up its victims The time axis inside the Precipice World is isolated from all other worlds, so the swallowed Reishi  remains suspended there without ever vanishing In fact, Kageroza obtained  decades-old information on Mod Souls from there Which means, Kurosaki’s Reishi  that was swallowed by the Cleaner might also still be there We’ll need to first collect  that Reishi, and then use Kageroza’s Reigai-creating  technology in reverse to artificially recreate  Kurosaki’s Spirit Energy Are you implying that we… Yes We’re going to break in to the  Department of Research and Development Is that even possible That’s like trying to catch a cloud But how are we going to  collect Ichigo’s Reishi Once the Cleaner swallows someone,  that person is dead, right Thats what seemed so  strange all this time Why don’t we sense any Spiritual  Pressure from Kageroza and Nozomi The reason is our answer The fact that Kageroza  obtained Mod Soul information that existed inside the Cleaner means… In effect… He was able to freely  enter into the Cleaner using a special Reigai that shuts  off his Spiritual Pressure That’s right Kurosaki, having lost his Spirit Energy, might be able to get inside the Cleaner Well Are you willing to take a chance, Kurosaki To be honest, I don’t  really understand, but I can’t come up with  any way to rescue Nozomi In that case, I have to take that chance! Are you ready Yeah I’ll attach a communication device In the event of an emergency, I want you to follow my directions Also, you’ll need this I’ve set it to respond to  the location of your Reishi When you find it, push this button down here Okay, got it Hey! Kon… Where do you think you’re  going in your condition Inside the Cleaner to  retrieve my Reishi Huh! What the hell are you thinking! This is the only way to rescue Nozomi See you Are you crazy! Huh This is all my fault It’s my fault, yet… Why do you have to go Kon… I’m powerless I can’t do a thing! I can’t protect anyone! I have to rely on you  to fight for me I have to rely on everyone  else fight to for me! It’s all…my fault! Kon… It’s not your fault It’s okay Just wait here I’ll be back, I promise Take this What’s this No sense in me keeping it A good luck charm, huh Thanks Kurosaki, are you ready Yeah At the moment, you’ll be able to move fairly freely inside  the Precipice World That said, we don’t know precisely  when the Cleaner will appear, so please be patient Got it Thank you for waiting, Kurosaki It’s coming Distance: 500 400 300 200 100 He’s in! Excellent So far, so good So this is the inside of the Cleaner  Even though it’s not responding  to Spiritual Pressure, the pressure in here is incredible How is it going If your Reishi is nearby, the collection device should respond Looks like it’s working I’ll head in that direction -Ichigo! -Kurosaki! The Cleaner’s movements  suddenly changed What’s that mean! It might be trying to expel any foreign objects as a response  to swallowing Kurosaki Kurosaki! Abandon the plan! Get away from there! Ichigo… Get away…how No, I’m doing this!  Huh! Damn! Ichigo… Ichigo! Hey! Ichigo! Answer! Ichigo! Quit fooling around, you idiot! You promised you’d come back! Was that a lie! You bastard! Shut up, will you I can hear everything! It’s responding! Okay! Now to find a way out Is that it there! Only one way to find out! W-What! Why is there…another me I don’t know what’s going on, but… Kurosaki! For a minute there, you had me worried You’re telling me What in the world happened Well, I don’t really know It’s just that… I don’t know what’s going on, but there was another  me inside the Cleaner I thought I rescued him, but… You rescued the other you Are you in your right mind What’s that supposed to mean! I see So that’s how it was, after all How what was That was the you who was swallowed  by the Cleaner before Huh The time axis of the Precipice World  is isolated from all other worlds That means anything swallowed by the The Cleaner does not exist  in any other time axis He met himself from the  past inside the Cleaner Yes The Kurosaki of the present saved  the Kurosaki from the past This is really complicated So that explains the  Combat Pass, as well The Reigai was able to obtain  Ichigo’s Combat Pass before we even arrived  in the Soul Society I was wondering how they did  it, but this was the answer Everything was done  using the same trick That’s enough already  You lost me Anyway, we can move on to  the next step now, right Let’s go visit Kageroza Yes I came back, just like I said Yeah I couldn’t do anything  to help you, after all No, that’s not true What Without this, I wouldn’t  have made it back safely, and I wouldn’t have been  able to meet the other me I owe it to you Are…you a moron! Just admit it Cut that out! Keep away from me, you! Now you’ve done it! My cotton! I’m becoming flat! Both time and space are right Let’s begin Captain Unohana Is there anything you require during  your stay in the World of the Living There is no need to worry The Shinto priest here provides me with goods when I whisper to him  during his sleep at night I think he’s mistaken  you for a deity, ma’am! I’m a Soul Reaper, so it’s not too far off Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! Ichigo! Yeah Huh Ichigo! Uh Renji Wrong! I’m Rukia! We swapped Gigai! We had you completely fooled! Whats with you two Kurosaki! Now then, can you tell  which one of us is which Umm… You guys aren’t even Gigai! "
" Hey Sorry to keep you all waiting Kurosaki, are you really  sure about this Forget it This isn’t the time to  worry about things like that He’s right Trying to restore Kurosaki’s  Spiritual Pressure is a huge gamble But winning that gamble  is our only hope Well, shall we be on our way, Kurosaki Wait What is it, Kon I’m coming with you! Coming with us Kon, that’s I don’t know if I’ll be any help You know, since I’m like this But I want to save Nozomi too No, I will save her! Nozomi! Nozomi!! No Of course, you can come Aren’t you the one who  first brought Nozomi to us It’s your duty to see this through Ichigo… You hold on to it this time For good luck Good for you! Don’t get in their way And don’t blame us if  you end up in shreds If he does, I’ll fix him Do your best Okay! Let’s go! Before we leave I have a favor to ask all of you Master Kageroza! Is it them Yes We’ve picked up several Spiritual Pressure signatures  in the Precipice World I’ll send forces to the  Senkaimon immediately Now, come on out! Odd I don’t sense them coming at all Hey! It’s stupid to just wait for them I’m going on ahead Hey! I came to greet you! Wait! Huh Look! I have a favor to ask all of you Me and Kurosaki…and Kon,  will make our way into the Soul Society Right on! It’s safe to assume that  the Reigai invasion forces have already set up a defense  line around the Senkaimon Therefore, the one’s suited  to get through safely are me, who is equipped to shut out my own Spiritual Pressure, and Kurosaki,  who lost his Spirit Energy Then what do you want us to do I want you to draw the  Reigai’s attention In other words…a decoy But how will you sneak  into the Soul Society I have a way This place! Isn’t this where Nozomi tried to hide Yes Even Kageroza would never suspect we’d come via such an  unstable area, right Let’s get going! Right So that’s it Zaraki! We must return! Hell no! You expect me not to enjoy this when the pray is right before my eyes You moron! These guys are decoys! Let’s go! No, Renji We’ll fall back for now All we can do now is to trust  in Ichigo and the others Right Ichigo… So far, so good I’m gonna die Suck it up If they find us here, it’s over We’re almost there Hey! Why the sudden stop! I thought you didn’t  want them to find us! Exactly We’re going to make sure they don’t Lieutenant Ise, please begin Yes, sir But you sure you want to do  this in your present condition I’m well aware of the risks It’s possible that the  fusion might not be stable, but I should be able to  manage it with medications All right, I’m counting  on the two of you DEPARTMENT OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Is this the place It should be Nozomi! I’ve come to rescue you! Where are you, Nozomi! What the hell The whole place is empty What’s going on! Calm down How can I stay calm! There’s nobody here, much  less Nozomi and Kageroza! I’m worried about Nozomi, of course… But we should proceed with  what we can do right now I’ve locked the room so no one  can enter here from the outside That should buy us a little time Let’s begin with restoring  your powers, Kurosaki Hey, what’s this! It appears to be a device  for creating Soul Candies Soul Candies! Not for making Mod Souls It’s his camouflage He’s supposed to be working for the Department of Research and Development It’d look suspicious if he’s not  conducting legitimate research here The only way was to use this  Soul Candy-making device Every piece of equipment here  is a device for creating Reigai I get it now! Kageroza was creating  Reigai while he was here in the Department of  Research and Development That’s right Okay, it’s showtime So, what now I will apply the technology  used to create Mod Souls to restore  your Spiritual Power First, I’ll restore the Reishi  data in the form of a Mod Soul, then fuse that with your own soul I believe this was the method used to create each of the  invasion force captains However, the strain on your soul will be severe because you are not a Reigai and this involves a high degree of risk Yeah… I’m okay with that All right Then let’s begin What’re you doing now I’m accessing the Mod Soul-creation  data that Kageroza retrieved You might say I’m  hacking into the system Hacking! You’re pretty awesome, Mr Urahara I am the founder of the Department of  Research and Development, you know Hey… We can’t take too long Lieutenant Kurotsuchi As we feared, the Fusion  Index is not increasing Please check the status on your end Okay, we’ll have a Mod Soul soon But Urahara… I thought Kageroza was unable  to reproduce my Hollow powers That’s correct We are extracting only  the Spiritual Power from your Reishi and copying  it to a Mod Soul Therefore, we cannot restore  your Hollow powers, but… You can restore my Spiritual Power Yes… if my calculations are correct What’s wrong! It seems they’re on to us! What! THIRTEEN COURT GUARD SQUADS INDUCTION CEREMONY Yushima I knew it Somebody told me you were inducted So it was true I remember you were having a hard time graduating from  the Soul Reaper Academy But good for you Thanks If you need anything, just ask Starting this spring, I’ve been  appointed as Eighth Seat of Squad 9 I might be able to help you We’ve confirmed the appearance  of a Hollow in the Rukon District Move out immediately and subdue it! Yes, sir! Sir… Please let me go too This is a real battle! Sending along a weaker  man puts that much more of a burden on the others But, I… A transfer! That’s right Starting next week, I want  you to join Squad 12, the Department of Research  and Development But I was just assigned here You’re not cut out for fighting You’re very smart And you’re a hard worker Wouldn’t you rather work at a place  where you can use your talents I’m… I’m… I’m… What are you saying! Your Project Spearhead  has been deemed inhumane Project Spearhead is  cancelled immediately, and all research data concerning  Mod Souls is to be destroyed No, please wait! Please…I demand an explanation! This research wing was ordered closed Turn over control immediately Any further resistance will  be considered treason Open up right now This is your last warning Don’t move! Hey! What’s wrong! Oh no! Hurry and call Squad 4! Hide… Lose yourself among those  incompetent Soul Reapers and hide your existence Then one day, carry on my will  and complete my research Kon… Ichigo… Huh Are my powers back Kurosaki! Thank goodness You’re all right Yeah But what happened This was Kageroza’s doing He had us completely figured out I had my suspicions since things  were going too smoothly But that’s okay Look My Spirit Energy is back Kurosaki, how Well… Moments before the explosion, I grabbed the Mod Soul  inside the capsule and… I see But… Kon Kon’s not here! Let’s find him! Kon! Where are you! Hey! Kon! Kon…are you… -dead -I’m not dead! Don’t go killing me off! I’m invulnerable! Something’s coming out of your hand My wadding! Oh no! I’m…going…to die I thought you said  you’re invulnerable What was that explosion It came from Seventh Seat Inaba’s lab We must not stay here Hurry! Right What’s wrong, Ichigo! What’s happening Hey, you’re… Hey, what’s going on! Kurosaki That Mod Soul you swallowed  was incomplete As a result, your restored Spirit  Energy is extremely unstable In your current state, your Hollow  Powers will rage out of control And take over! Are you serious! What should we do! There’s still a way Even though Kageroza’s main  objective is fusing with Kujo, I can’t believe a scientist would  sacrifice all of his research Kageroza must have a separate  lab somewhere else A lab! A research laboratory I know that! Let’s find it! Yes There, we should be able to stabilize  Kurosaki’s Spirit Energy And… that’s where we’ll  find Kujo, as well Hey, are you okay I’m okay Who’s there! What are you doing there! Show yourselves! Quickly Right! We’ve been expecting you Shoot Looks like you don’t have much  of your power back, Ichigo But we won’t show mercy So that’s what he meant Damn it We’re not giving  up because of this! Kurosaki I’ll try and hold them off here You two get past them! What are you saying! A suicide dash How pathetic of you Yoruichi! I’m not alone You’re all…alive! Now then, it’s time to fight Say, Kisuke I demand you give me a gift of  gratitude for saving you this time around How about three silver vines Nope I’ll add new sand for your litter box Nope Umm… Then I’ll also add  an expensive can of cat food Deal! You’re fine with that! Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! Damn! Look what happened to my body All right I’m rather good at this sort of thing I’ll fix you right up! Done! No, you’re not! Really  Let me have another go How’s that Why am I in worse shape  than when you started! But I did my very best How’s that You kidding me! Put me back the way I was!"
" We’ve been expecting you So that’s what he meant Damn it We’re not giving up because of this! Kurosaki I’ll try and hold them off here You two get past them! What are you saying! A suicide dash How pathetic of you Yoruichi! I’m not alone You’re all…alive! Now then, it’s time to fight But where were you guys  hiding this whole time Well, Kukaku saved us  from quite a close call Soi Fon!  Oh! Kukaku!  Damn Who are they!  I didn’t expect there  were still others  Just in case, I took  measures beforehand We healed our injuries  at Kukaku’s place and waited for the  opportunity to strike back You’re in the way! Stay back! What did you just say! He’s right We’ll handle things here Get going! Yoruichi! Let’s go! Come back, you bastards! Now there’s nothing in our way! How many times have I fought you people Damn it! This time, I’m settling  it once and for all! Hey, you okay, Ichigo I’m fine Never mind me Let’s find Kageroza’s lab quickly Ichigo! Kon… Mr Urahara… You almost turned into a Hollow again I see I’m guessing that the balance between  the Hollow powers and the Soul Reaper powers inside  of you is breaking down This isn’t easy for me to say, but… I want you to remain here, Kurosaki Mr Urahara! Hey! Hang in there, Ichigo! Come on! Kurosaki, you know your body best Ichigo, you stay here! Let me handle this! I’ll restore your Spiritual Pressure I swear, you hear! Yeah, but… Why can’t you just say something  like “I’m counting on you” Don’t you dare think of  me as a mere stuffed animal! What is it, Kon  I’m coming with you!  Kon, that’s  I don’t know if I’ll be any help  You know, since I’m like this  But I want to save Nozomi too  No, I will save her!  You’re right Huh I’m counting on you, Kon I wasn’t expecting that! Kinda gives me the creeps! Oh, and one other thing Take this with you The Reishi Collector It’s in good hands Say… Was that really necessary Well, just to be safe Don’t know if it’s  going to help him, though Anyway, let’s try to get  back as soon as possible, Kon Alone with this guy Did you say something Jeez…nothing! DEPARTMENT OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT No matter how many times we fight, it won’t do any good There is only one true  head of the Kuchiki Clan Exactly… And that one is me Not bad Still want more Now that’s the way I like it! -The fun starts now! -The fun starts now! Lady Yoruichi! Right! She has good reflexes A little too good They’ve improved their capabilities This is going to be troublesome Man, you’re no challenge at all! I suppose your pride won’t let you turn away from a Reigai and run, eh You’ve got it all wrong It’s because protecting  the Soul Society is the mission of the Thirteen  Court Guard Squads! Hey, Clogs DEPARTMENT OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT What is it, Kon Isn’t this the place  we just escaped from! BACK DOOR Yes, which is why we’re  going through the back door That’s not what I meant! Why did we go the long way around just to come back here! You know the saying, “to deceive your enemies,  deceive your friends first” I get that! But explain why we took our sweet time! The truth is, I wanted to investigate Kageroza’s unit, Squad 12, first But to do that, I needed to make our pursuers  think we went somewhere else Are you telling me the truth Unfortunately, there’s nothing  left from my time here Hold on You used to be in Squad 12, like Kageroza You mean I never mentioned it I never heard about it! That means you knew about  Kageroza all along! Actually… He wasn’t inducted  yet when I was here You’re so useless! Now then… Let’s hope we find something Hey, it’s asking for a password! I know Every piece of equipment here  is under Kurotsuchi’s control It’s not too difficult to figure out what Kurotsuchi might come up with Too bad Wrong Oh dear Hey! Then, how about this Too bad Wrong Hey! Then this one See Wasn’t that just a lucky guess I can’t make heads or tails of it Is this what you wanted Yes According to this, Kageroza was inducted approximately sixty years ago Sixty years, eh What about Nozomi I don’t see any data on Kujo What is it Hey, Clogs! Stop ignoring me! Say something! Let’s go, Kon Huh Hey, where are you going! Give me an explanation! To the library There are some records I want to check Wow! Look at all these books! So, what are you checking The records of each squad’s  recruits and discharges between the time I was banished  and Kageroza appeared I see Let’s go to the Squad 10 barracks Huh Stop keeping things to yourself! The bastard is all about himself! Are they gone Looks like it So, did you learn something It’s time you told me If you don’t, I’ll shout out! Calm down, Kon Do you remember what Kujo said before What Nozomi said He…  I…  -…developed the Mod Souls -…developed the Mod Souls  And then she also said… The very first Mod Soul developed…  was…  me  However, Kageroza… It’s simple, really  Simply put, Nozomi and I were born from the Reishi  of a single Soul Reaper Their stories are clearly different So that means one of them is lying! Perhaps so But what if what they both said is true Huh In other words, what if Kageroza  was a Mod Soul himself The two were once a single Mod Soul And that was the first Mod Soul But what did he mean by “developer” Who created that Mod Soul Like the invasion force, Mod Souls  were originally created from the Reishi of a particular Soul Reaper, and then imbued with  enhanced capabilities If so, then there’s only one answer The developer used himself  as the base for the Mod Soul Exactly! Which would mean, then,  that Kujo and Kageroza are both the developer  and the first Mod Soul So they were both telling the truth We’re going to the Squad  10 barracks to find out If we can uncover the true developer, we can probably find the lab, as well And if we find the lab, we can restore Ichigo’s  Spiritual Pressure Hey, Clogs, when did you  figure all that out I had my guesses before we  came here to the Soul Society Then you should have just told us  instead of keeping it to yourself! Which is why I’ve been gathering  the evidence to prove it At the Squad 12 barracks… I reviewed the records from the  time I left the Soul Society until the time Kageroza took his post in the Department of Research  and Development And I expected to find a Soul Reaper who disappeared before  Kageroza showed up, but… Those records had all been erased And that’s why you  went to the library Yes I thought the library  might still have records that had not been erased So, how’d that go I found nothing in Squad  12’s registry of names, but I did find signs of alterations to the  books of another squad And What book was that It was a book of Squad 10’s  records from 96 years ago Come on, haven’t you found it yet Nothing that looks like it But there’s no way that these  records could’ve been changed Bring me more books Here it is! Huh What! You found it Yes, I’m positive It’s dated 96 years ago Transferred to Squad 12… What’s the guy’s name OUKO YUSHIMA Ouko…Yushima… Hey! This guy does sort of look like Nozomi So, where is this guy now What’s this cross mark mean It means he doesn’t exist in Squad 12 He must be there The Special Underground  Confinement Station, also known as the Maggot’s Nest Maggot’s Nest The Thirteen Court Guard Squads  make no provision for resignation That means that if no  records exist after their time in service, this is  the only place they could be There’s no one here There wasn’t even a guard  at the entrance back there Doesn’t this seem strange Yes, I know That’s because… We thought you might  come, Kisuke Urahara! We’ve been waiting for you! Today, I’ll put an end  to you with these hands! It’s the Bee Chick and Diet Fatso! Who’re you calling Diet Fatso! Don’t go putting me  with that original! Are you ready, Kon I’ll hold them off here Right! Gotcha! Omaeda, go after him! Right! Just as I thought, this is the place This is where Ouko Yushima, the developer of Mod Souls, is Damn you! Sting all enemies to death, Suzumebachi! Come back here, you bastard! I can’t outrun him! Hey, Clogs! Help me! Huh! This way! Shibari Benihime Wow! Hiasobi Benihime, Juzutsunagi Damn it! You did it! The doppelganger plan worked! Thanks to you, Kon Well, yeah, but I didn’t do much! Come on, let’s go Right! Let’s go meet the real developer! Hey, is he really in a place like this This is the facility’s lowest level If he’s not here, then those two we met earlier were guarding this place for nothing Good point Are you Ouko Yushima He’s not responding Hey you! Get up! Time to wake up! Good morning! It’s no use Huh! It doesn’t look like he’ll  ever regain consciousness What I’m sick of being so small! Man, I wish I were inside  a big, strong Gigai! I agree Right So you’re saying you’ll take my place to go up against  Omaeda and Soi Fon Even if you get beaten down into pulp Umm…I’ll stick with  being small after all Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! Thanks to the rest we got here… It looks like everyone’s healed Now that I think about it,  during the time he was healing, Kuchiki was going somewhere every night After Kuchiki left, you could hear the sound of wood being  pounded on until dawn So that was the sound of him training "
" Are you Ouko Yushima He’s not responding Hey you! Get up! Time to wake up! Good morning! It’s no use Huh! It doesn’t look like he’ll  ever regain consciousness What Hey! Snap out of it! Hey! It won’t do any good But with him like this, we won’t be able to get the location of Kageroza’s lab out of him! We finally reached the  developer of Mod Souls, but it turned out to be a dead end No, I expected this Huh Realizing he’d be  locked away to conceal Project Spearhead’s  existence, he must have… What’s wrong I found it Our clue to the lab Are you serious What’s that It’s blood Blood Whose is it It hasn’t been here long It doesn’t appear to be his blood Which means… Someone else was here Kageroza! Yes But how is the blood going to help us We need to thank Kurotsuchi What! You’re using that device! Yes I’ll use this blood to  pinpoint his location But…you can’t detect Kageroza’s  Spiritual Pressure, so… With just his blood, no But this blood contains  a drug Kurotsuchi Mayuri created This drug stops the human  thought processes That drug is in here In other words, if we look for  the location of that drug That’s where Kageroza will be! His lab! That’s right A Hollow! What’s it doing here! What squad are you with Lieutenant Ise! All squads are to stand  by in their barracks Those are your orders But… What is that Hollow And we sense captain-level Spiritual  Pressure clashing everywhere What’s going on Please tell us Calm down For now, we’ll need to  deal with that Hollow! Now go! Y-Yes, ma’am! I am the true head of the Kuchiki Clan! What’s the matter Looks like he got you! Need some help No thanks Don’t interfere If you need help, feel free to ask I’m having way too much fun! Let me make this clear,  I’m killing this guy! Don’t butt in! Hmm… I think they have the edge The capabilities of the Reigai  have significantly improved Damn that Kageroza Anyhow, let’s kill one per person No, maybe two per person Quit fooling around! Here they come! Bushogoma That’s quite a nice imitation! Bushogoma! Sogyonokotowari Sogyonokotowari Excellent move! A Sogyonokotowari return fire! This is no time for jokes Yeah, you’re right It does seem inappropriate I think we should pull  back for the moment All right Captains Hitsugaya, Kuchiki  and Komamura, pull back! I’m not backing down! Captain Hitsugaya! It’s no use trying to run! I’m taking you down! Gokei, Senbonzakura Kageyoshi Bushogoma! Guncho Tsurara! Hado 88: Hiryu Gekizoku Shinten Raiho! This is the place It’s huge What is this structure It’s the Senkaimon used  by all the Soul Reapers in the Soul Society to enter  the World of the Living Why are we here Beats me You mean you don’t know You don’t inspire much confidence Stop Is that a Reigai It seems this is definitely  the right place And it looks like I  have to battle it out with my Reigai as well I’ll throw the first attack Kon, use that opportunity  to find a way inside H-Hold on a sec! I’m no good with machines and I don’t really know what to do The procedure is identical to what I did at the Department of  Research and Development I’ll follow you as soon as I can Until I get there, do what you can Yeah, but… Nozomi should also be there You’re right Gotcha! Looks like that’s the entrance That was too close for comfort As I expected, you came in that coat You knew it was me So much for that It feels sort of awkward, you know Crossing swords with myself You think so It doesn’t bother me much at all I wish you wouldn’t get in our way Okay, then! This way! Nozomi… Where are you! This way! Nozomi… Nozomi, hang on! Nozomi! Nozomi! Hey! Nozomi! It’s me, Kon! Wake up! Damn it! Hey! Nozomi! Wake up! Nozomi! Shut up, pervert Nozomi… I’ll have you out in a minute! How do I get you out Get away Huh Quickly… Get away from here I’m not leaving! Why do you think I came  all the way here! Relax! I’ll restore Ichigo’s Spiritual  Pressure and rescue you! Two birds with one stone Get away! If you stay here, you’ll… I said I’m not leaving! I can’t ignore a friend in trouble! Friend All right! How do I do this Okay! First, I’ll restore Ichigo’s  Spiritual Pressure! As I recall… The procedure is identical  to what I did at the Department of  Research and Development Like I would remember! What am I supposed to do, you idiot! That sounded like Kon’s voice I’d better hurry You’re not going anywhere! A portable Gigai! That would be correct Damn I’m good Yeah, I am This is no time to be indecisive! If I don’t hurry, Nozomi  will be fused with Kageroza! If that happens, Ichigo and the other  Soul Reapers will be… No! I won’t let that happen! But… I said to get away quickly Nozomi! Once the fusion is complete, there’s no telling  what’s going to happen No telling What’s going to happen to you Once you’re fused, will  you no longer be yourself I don’t know But Ouko Yushima had sworn vengeance He wants revenge against the Soul Society for not recognizing  his accomplishments To that end, Ouko split his  soul into two Mod Souls, turning himself into a mere shell Don’t move! Hey! What’s wrong! Oh no! Hurry and call Squad 4! Hide… Lose yourself among those  incompetent Soul Reapers and hide your existence Then one day, carry on my will and complete my research By splitting himself into two, his Spiritual Pressure also changed, allowing himself to go unnoticed Kageroza inherited Ouko’s  vengeance and ambition And you, Nozomi I inherited his self-control Kageroza and I are like  darkness and light Light Then you’ll still remain,  even after the fusion I don’t know I might be swallowed  up by the darkness What! The vengefulness Kageroza  inherited from Ouko has become increasingly clouded,  depraved and inflated to the point where even the  light might be swallowed up That’s why you need  to get away quickly While I still have my consciousness Nozomi… Nozomi! Nozomi! Nozomi! I said I’m not leaving! You said you were the light I’m glad I met you You’re my light, as well I was always alone I won’t let that  light be extinguished! For the first time in my life, I realized that I wasn’t alone I promise to protect you! We’re… We’re… - Friends! - Friends! Hado 32: Oukasen! Whoa! Hado 54: Haien! You still had a portable Gigai left How many do you have, anyway Kon… Damn! This isn’t working at all! Wait… Huh From this point on, do as I tell you You know what to do I caught a glimpse of  Kageroza’s memory You did! But first we need Ichigo’s Reishi I brought it with me Oh my! Looks like you’re out  of portable Gigai Yup, I’m all out If you have any last words,  I’m willing to listen That’s very kind of you But it isn’t over yet Is that so Then… Hado 88: Hiryu Gekizoku Shinten Raiho! An eighties-level Hado  without an incantation! Hey, it started up Nozomi, am I doing this right Yeah… Next, flip the switch on the far right Gotcha! Oh! Yes! It’s working! You can relax now, Nozomi, I’ll have you out in no time! Come on, come on! Come on, come on! Come on, come on! Come on, already! I’m afraid it looks like  we’re at a disadvantage But we can’t afford to lose You guys don’t know when to give up You can’t win against us It’s time for the Reigai  to become the real things Give up already I refuse! Why do you keep on fighting For what purpose Don’t make me keep repeating myself! We protect what must be protected! That’s all there is to it I see But the same is true for us, as well The same Don’t make me laugh! You’re right It  isn’t quite the same We’ll show you what  sets us apart from you I swore an oath…to protect! Just a little more! Kon! Kon! Kon! Kon! What are you doing! Stop it! Stop… Kon… Hado 31: Shakkaho! S-Stay Stay away! How pitiful Way to go, me! I’m  strong even as a Regai! Of course! But there’s one thing  that bothers me What a coincidence Me too -The stubble should go -The stubble should go -Wow, we think alike -Wow, we think alike Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! Lieutenant Ise! It’s dangerous here We should leave! That’s Captain Hitsugaya! No That’s the work of the Hollowfied  Substitute Soul Reaper! What That’s also a Hollow! What! Regardless of what anyone says, its a Hollow! HOLLOW >> LIE You’re lying! "
" I’ll have you out in no time! Come on, come on! Come on, come on! Kon! Kon! Kon! Kon!! What are you doing! Stop it! Stop… Kon… Hado Number 31, Shakkaho! Stay away! Stay away! How pitiful URAHARA’S SHOP No word from Urahara yet! Not yet They’re taking too long If you’re all so worried,  why not go and check Ikkaku! Are you fully recovered This doesn’t even count as an injury So, how about it, Renji Well… Please go! Huh! Earlier, we confirmed many captain-level Spiritual Pressures  inside the Seireitei Then Brother and the others are… Boss gave us permission to  be flexible as needs arise… I believe now is the  best time to attack… Renji! Right! We’re heading into the Soul Society!! All that’s left for you  is self-destruction… I won’t have to do it myself anymore Who is this guy… Nozomi No… Is this Kageroza Given my druthers, I prefer not  to fight with brute force… Agreed But that’s precisely why it makes sense to press this  battle with brute force… Unlike you, who shirked  brute force combat training, I received considerable training here Crap… Bankai! Kokujo Tengen Myo-oh!! What do you think Yeah…I think we have a problem… They pretend to fight one-on-one, but strike at the openings  of other opponents I know… That gives them a numerical advantage Yeah We need to make sure we kill  them to reduce their numbers… For crying out loud, they’re  such barbarians… I wish they’d try to leave those future guinea pigs as  unharmed as possible Oh my, and you’re going to just  watch from your lofty perch How can a person like you be a captain of the Thirteen  Court Guard Squads Amusing… Spoken by a Mod Soul…how  very amusing… I’ve made up my mind Oh What about To do a live-body experiment on the Squad 4 captain’s Reigai  who always irritates me… Claw out… Ashisogijizo! Minazuki Bakudo Number 63, Sajosabaku! That won’t work on me… What Impossible… Captain Kurotsuchi! Bankai… Senbonzakura Kageyoshi It won’t be long now… Even in that state, you still pursue me Bakudo Number 30, Shitotsusansen I don’t have time to  waste dealing with you Hado Number 58, Tenran!! Bakudo Number 99, Restrict!! I told you, I can’t be wasting  any more time here with you! What is this Spiritual Pressure Looks like Kageroza has  achieved full strength Finally, a game-changing  turn in this battle… Yeah, victory is ours Bakudo Number 4, Hainawa!! Whoa! That was so dangerous of you I suppose catching you  off-guard is pointless if you can still see my attack In that case… I’ll just have to block your view! Bakudo Number 37, Tsuriboshi You’re wasting your time! Bakudo Number 63, Sajosabaku! Bakudo Number 63, Sajosabaku! Gochu Tekkan!! What! Had you going there! Firing salvos of techniques  leaves you wide open Hado Number 88, Hiryu  Gekizoku Shinten Raiho!! Bakudo Number 81, Danku! Didn’t I tell you  I’d block your view There’s no way I wouldn’t  know what you’re thinking Hado Number 32, Oukasen! I pity you… Unable to return to being a Soul Reaper nor are you able to  become a full Hollow… A polar opposite from the  complete being I have become… Raiku… Farewell, Substitute Soul Reaper! What Ichigo! Roar! Zabimaru!! Huh Is this Spiritual Pressure…that  of Kageroza’s No… Did he get Kujo! Nozomi… It’s the worst possible situation! So it’s you people… You should know by now that  you’re no match for me… What did you come here for We came to save our friends! Friends! Loneliness is not a sin No matter what the circumstances, I don’t need help from others Other people only get in the way To help…is mere pity… It is jealousy towards the strong… An insult to a noble spirit To be alone is to be the only one The privilege…of a superior soul Friends, you say If your lives are of so little value that you’d sacrifice them for  another without hesitation, then die here and now!! This ends now!! Matsumoto! We’re here to help, Captain No one asked for your help But… These small fry are making it  hard to concentrate on my fight You guys handle cleanup Yes, sir! With pleasure! Ishida! His Zanpakuto takes slices  of space and recreates them When we fought last, I thought  he was manipulating time, but that’s not what he does at all He uses his Zanpakuto to recreate  a space that didn’t exist before and shifts his location  in space in that instant Isn’t that right Oh… I apologize for underestimating you… This time, I will show  you my true power No you won’t! Roar, Zabimaru! Seethe, Sumitsukigasa! What was that What’re you looking at Cry, Benihime! This ends it! Abarai! You’re not getting away! What! Sumitsukigasa! W-What just happened That was the true power of  my Zanpakuto, Sumitsukigasa W-What Duplicating an adversary’s attack and reproducing it is the  power of “Raiku”… Absorbing an adversary’s  Spiritual Pressure and turning it into one’s own is  Nozomi’s “Arazomeshigure” Sumitsukigasa possesses  the power of both Raiku consumes a great deal  of my Spiritual Pressure and entails a risk when reproducing  an adversary’s attack… But with the power of Arazomeshigure, I am now able to absorb the attack and continue to counterattack  indefinitely That’s absurd…is that even possible I am both Kageroza  Inaba and Nozomi Kujo Should it be any wonder that  her capabilities now reside in my Zanpakuto I’ll crush that power  of yours head-on!! Abarai, don’t!! Bankai! Hihio Zabimaru!! Fool… Sumitsukigasa Renji!! If we attack recklessly,  the force will be absorbed and directed back at us… What can we do In that case… All we can do is mount an attack  that he can’t absorb… Tetsuzaemon! Don’t be distracted  by multiple opponents! Concentrate only on your own! I know that, sir! Cursed Reigai… They’ve turned this into a brawl, attacking at random and  effectively exploiting our unguarded moments The pride of the originals, who value fighting one-on-one,  is working to our disadvantage At this rate… Damn! Licht Regen! Tsuginomai, Hakuren! Hihio Zabimaru!! Those attacks won’t work! I will put you down one by one so that you won’t be able to  coordinate your attacks Now, Kuchiki! Hakuren!! Don’t mess with me! What! Damn you! Too slow! Now that I am one with Nozomi, my powers far surpass yours Your inept trickery will have no effect So you were after  Nozomi…for this power… Yes This is the original  power of my Zanpakuto But my weak original body was unable  to wield it to its full potential My true objective for becoming a Reigai was to be able to fully  control this Zanpakuto Are you… planning to use your power to  rule the the Soul Society… Rule You still believe that nonsense What! My objective is to destroy  the Soul Society Iro Oni… White! For that reason, I can’t afford to waste any more time Die Ichigo!! Captain! If you continue to use your Bankai, our squad’s repair budget  is going to run out! Don’t let it bother you, Tetsuzaemon But your Bankai draws  the most attention! That’s why the other squads are  going to blame everything on us! You mean, all of this! Yes, sir… Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! Today, I will personally explain  how to create my invasion force Reigai are what you might call Gigai  that allow to Mod Souls to be active That is why they revert to Mod Souls  when their bodies are destroyed Conversely, as long as this pill  remains, they can be recreated Now then, as for the all-important  process of creating Mod Souls… Hey! Are you guys even listening! "
" Seethe, Sumitsukigasa! Are you planning to use your power to rule the Soul Society Rule You still believe that nonsense My objective is to destroy  the Soul Society What! I can’t afford to waste any more time Die Ichigo! Ichigo! His Hollowfication is undone! Ichigo, are you all right! Rukia Impossible What just happened Kurosaki! Inoue! Take Ichigo and get away from here! No, I can’t leave here What are you saying! That wasn’t Kageroza At that moment, my  consciousness went blank It’s me Yes, sir I need more fusion stabilizer Prepare it immediately Right away Fusion stabilizer So his fusion isn’t permanent yet Seems that way Substitute Soul Reaper Ignoring you was a mistake Although your Spiritual  Pressure is gone, I cannot allow you to live Renji! Ishida! Chad! Step aside Sorry, we’re not so obedient  as to do as our enemy says We won’t let you have your way There aren’t any idiots here who’d hand over a friend to an enemy! Friend You still say that You’re fools spilling your own  blood for the sake of others Are friends defined by the  worthless sacrifices one makes Then go ahead and disappear  right this moment! Byakuya! So close Are you okay! Hado Number 63!: Raikoho! They’re keeping the pressure on Why did you take such  a risk to protect me Damn, they have us surrounded! This is bad! The captains are Captain Kuchiki needs medical attention! Oh no you don’t! They’re not going to miss an  opportunity to hit us while we’re down Their strategy is to switch  in and out at will If one of us is injured and slowed down, that is the person they attack But there’s no way  to get away from here Who cares! All we need to do is kill off  the rest of them one by one! The Reigai are trying to  separate and isolate us! Shut up! I hate little details! Agreed! What should we do If we lose even one combatant, theyll use that opportunity  to take us out One small mistake, and we could get ourselves annihilated Seethe! Sumitsukigasa! El Directo! Tsuginomai! Hakuren! Hihio Zabimaru! Oh yes If nothing else, I should’ve  been more wary of your weapon It weakens the bonds between reishi Exactly You’re not the only one  that can absorb reisihi Interesting You’re going to challenge  me by absorbing my reishi Whatever the battle, I can’t see you emerging victorious when you underestimate  the power of my friends What are you trying to say You’ll find out soon enough Pathetic What! Bakudo Number 4! Hainawa! Now, Ishida! You can no longer escape What do you say we have  a contest of endurance What! I had you figured out a long time ago You’re able to create a containment field by placing  those weapons in five corners To activate the technique, it must consume the reishi  stored within its hilt You created the containment  as you attacked me, but as you were doing that, you failed to notice that I  used Sumitsukigasa to absorb the reishi from your hilt Not knowing that, you  sacrificed your own allies In the end, that is all that your  so-called “friends” mean to you! Oh I knew, all right I knew you’d see through  my Sprenger attack and that you’d absorb the  reishi from my Seeleschneider However It’s over, Kageroza! Don’t worry We’re going to imprison him like  this without triggering the explosion If we can continue to drain  the Spiritual Pressure from the wound on his back where  the reishi bond was weakened, it should be able to undo  his fusion with Kujo Don’t underestimate me! Hajokuri! W-What the hell is that! It’s swallowing up  Sprenger’s reishi! Hajokuri turns everything around it  into reishi and takes it in, then Die, Substitute Soul Reaper! Dammit! They won’t initiate an attack And why is that If we keep a tight formation, they can’t use a strategy of  switching off on opponents to disrupt us I don’t think any of them will risk sacrificing themselves  to break our formation So you threw yourself at them  in order to test their tactics You sure about that If one of you leave this place What would happen once our  side outnumbers yours This is great Let’s have a test of wills Dammit What What’s going on Something’s strange Stop…stop it Stop it That was! Is the fusion starting to break down Stop it! Stop what you’re doing! Nozomi!! Ichigo! Nozomi! I’ll get you out of there! Don’t let that bastard  Kageroza swallow you up! Ichigo… Please… Kill me What’re you talking about! This Zanpakuto can kill him Do it while I hold him at bay! Quickly! You know I can’t do such a thing! Please I’m begging you You all protected me Now it’s my turn to protect everyone I can’t! We’re friends! We will save you! Renji! Ichigo! Step away! I should’ve killed you  when I had the chance! Rukia! Renji! Friends Tell me, Substitute Soul Reaper Why do you people use that word Why do you cling to that word when your backs are against the wall Why Why do you fight this way What! Why do you separate us and attack the one  isolated from the others I understand it as a tactic, but it doesn’t seem  like a choice that you, who should possess the same  pride we do, would make To distrust others, loathe  your fellow members, and consider isolation a virtue That must be the true  nature of Kageroza What’s wrong Can’t answer Ichigo… Ichigo… You see! Friends are meaningless! A solitary life is the only  true validation of existence! I organized an invasion force  without help from anyone That force, is about to annihilate  the 13 Court Guard Squads that refused to give me my due By resurrecting myself as a Mod Soul, I was able to acquire the true power of the Zanpakuto that I could not  wield in my original form This is truly the ideal existence  of solitude that I have strived for! Pathetic… Haven’t you realized Mod Souls are based on a  Soul Reaper’s reishi Which means you can’t  create them all by yourself And beside, you couldn’t wield  your true power without Nozomi, who you severed from yourself You just proved that you  couldn’t do a thing without those around you! No one can do anything all by himself! Refusing to acknowledge that makes you a damn fool! Are you accusing that his nature  is affecting our style of fighting You’re not going to break our  solidarity using methods like that Shut up! You’re Don’t…! I’ll put off eliminating  you just a bit longer You can watch the moment Nozomi  becomes completely mine Then you can die You What is the meaning of this! It means this! That voice… Kon! Stupid dummy You fell for it, What do you say to that Serves you damn right! Stop it! You’re creeping us out! Oh…That feels good How did you! You want to know Let’s see… MAYURI Kurotsuchi pretended to be killed URAHARA Then he liquefied his body and found Kageroza’s lab, so together we defeated my imposter, NEMU then removed the pill  from the lieutenant, KON and replaced it with Kon’s pill That’s what Clogs said! You have me to thank for everything! For what! You didn’t do a thing! Yeah I did! Here! It’s a Mod Soul with  your Spirit Energy! I kept my promise, Ichigo! Now it’s your turn! Listen to you You sorry excuse for a Mod Soul You didn’t create me! I’m better than the ones you created! Don’t show them an opening I know Those same tactics won’t work again! What is it with you guys I told you to keep outta this! Sorry about that, Captain This might be our last battle Please allow us to die with you Our place of death has  already been decided, sir What Suit yourselves Well, I suppose it’d be nice to have someone cover my back sometimes! Working together in battle Now that’s really out of character When it comes to  protecting what we must, we’ll use any means we can Protect what you must Are you referring to your pride No We have but one thing that we protect: The Soul Society Hang on, Nozomi You won’t ever be alone again We promise to save you! Let’s show this bastard  the power of friendship! Go! Ichigo! Bankai! Good job, Kon But weren’t you scared This was nothing, if it  means I could save you two! Wow, Kon! But you were scared a little, right No, really, I wasn’t scared at all! I’m serious! This didn’t scare me a bit! Say, I have a suggestion If we have to, we could eviscerate him When we’re done, we could  use him for experiments The pervert owner’s in this too! So… Will you help us Noooo! "
" I found out… I wasn’t strong… Nor was I weak… There was no hatred… No anger… Only… Bankai…eh I hope that’s not your way of saying your Spirit Energy  has fully returned Maybe… Want to find out You guys wait here Kurosaki… I’ll finish this in an instant! Don’t push your luck with  some makeshift Bankai… Ichigo Kurosaki! Ichigo! Damn it! Kon! No! What’re you saying, Sis! We can’t stand here and wait! Kon… At times like this, we should  be fighting together! How much rest do you guys need! You’ve rested enough! You don’t know when  to shut up, do you All right! Let’s go! Wait! Sis! If you insist on going… We’ll all go together! Guys… Somenomai, Tsukishiro! You people never learn! Stop making trouble! You’re the one causing trouble! El Directo! Damn it… Hado 73: Soren Sokatsui! Huh! Getsuga… Tensho! He’s unable to absorb  Kurosaki’s Getsuga! As we suspected, Kageroza is  unable to harness Hollow powers! It’s more powerful…  Wondering why my Getsugatensho  is more powerful now Somewhere in my mind, I was afraid of losing my Spirit Energy But I finally realized  it once I lost my powers Realized what That I can’t stand the thought of regretting without  giving my best shot I will defeat you with  everything I’ve got! I admit that you are different  compared to when we last fought However… It hardly matters Is he manipulating space again! At this rate, capturing Kageroza will be difficult,  much less saving Nozomi Is there some way to save Kujo Soul Chain and Soul Sleep… The two vital points of a soul, if  we can shatter his Soul Chain… I get it… If we stop the flow of Spirit  Energy within his body, there’s a chance that he  will split back into two But… The Soul Chain, right Kon! Kon I’ll go tell Ichigo! Is that the best you  can do with the help of your so-called friends Or has your Spirit Energy  completely run out I thought I told you… As long as I can save Nozomi… and protect my friends,  then it doesn’t matter! In that case, I’ll end it quickly for you! The strap! This is what I was waiting for… What! Huh! Let go of me! Damn you! Let go! Take this! Do it! Getsuga… Tensho! Did we win Damn you… Damn you… Don’t What’s… happening to my body My head! Damn it! Ichigo… Nozomi! Finish us This is our only chance! Please! Ichigo! The Soul Chain! Shatter his Soul Chain! Go! Ichi What! Damn you… Stop fighting a futile battle You’ve lost You think…I’ve lost! I’ll show you if it’s futile or not! If I’m going to lose this body, I will destroy everything! Renzan: Hajokuri! What! Hey! What the hell is that! I don’t know! What the hell What is this Spiritual Pressure! It’s unbelievable He still had this much power left No, this Spiritual Pressure is the  Reishi of the Soul Society itself He’s absorbing it! What is that How are we supposed to deal with  that kind of Spiritual Pressure This wasn’t part of the plan… Things are getting interesting! It would appear you guys weren’t  expecting this either This Spiritual Pressure is insane So much force with  just a single blast… What should we do now It’s growing bigger and bigger I think we’re in trouble Damn it We have to act fast Oh, crap! Danku Old Man Yama! Kageroza Inaba’s, or should I say… Ouko Yushima’s every scheme is spurred by vengeance against the Soul Society He intends to destroy the  Soul Society along with himself Damn it! Never did I dream the  end would be like this But, so be it Come with me, Ichigo Kurosaki… to that place between  chaos and nothingness It’s getting bigger! It’s up to us to stop it Wait Reigai! You people… Going for an all-out attack That’s not it Do you recall, Master Genryusai Certainly, to the real ones, what we’re doing might seem like  a simple rebellion by imposters But we Reigai have our way  of following through  with what we believe And what is that  We cannot tell you just yet  The time has come for you to understand the  meaning of those words What You claim that what you protect  is very clear to you— and it is for us, as well We will protect the Soul  Society in our own way It is the duty of us Mod Souls to stop a fellow Mod Soul who  has gone out of control Let’s go! What! They’re… Oh well! Damn them! You’re not stopping me! Again! You’ve done enough… What’s happening! Stop it, Nozomi! Let’s end this Nozomi! What’re you doing! Those guys… Looks like they had pride, as well Is everyone okay Yeah, just barely… Ichigo…  Looks like your invasion force didn’t work out the way you planned Now all that’s left  is to rescue Nozomi Why! Why can’t I defeat you! Why Why can’t I defeat you What drives you this far Damn… you! You have something to protect, dont you! You have friends! To be there for! To shield! To be close to! Only the weak would seek  the aid of others…  So why… Why are you so strong! We found out We weren’t strong, nor were we weak There was no hatred No anger Only that we were alone Nozomi… Were we…mistaken I don’t know I see… Nozomi! Are you all right Kon… Yes, I’m all right Your right arm Oh, this This is nothing Well, all’s good now, right You’re right C’mon, let’s go back to the  World of the Living, Nozomi! You’re… Nozomi… Forgive me, Ichigo This was the only way Ichigo, what’s going on Kon… This is as it should be What’re you talking about, Nozomi! There’s nothing good about it! At the very end, I told him… This time, I would be his friend Friend I learned what it meant  to have friends Now it’s my turn to teach him… Don’t say that! It’s like you’re going  to disappear forever! I won’t let you do this! Thank you for this, Kon I…couldn’t protect you, huh That’s not true You did protect me We were alone But we’re at peace now It’s because all of you… Because Ichigo, and you were there, Kon Yeah, I’m there for you! I’ll always be there for you! So… All this time, I couldn’t  hear it…but now I can The voice of my soul deep inside me… Can you hear it, Kon I can’t hear deep inside of you… But… If you let me put my ear to your  breast, I’d be willing to try You really are a pervert,  you know that! Well pardon me! Don’t forget us… I won’t… After all, we’ll always be… Friends…forever… Hey, there’s something I want to say before we head back to  the World of the Living Oh yeah Go for it Let it all out while you can Bankai! Bankai, Bankai, Bankai,  Bankai, Bankai, Bankai! What the hell was that about! I’m stacking up on  my call outs since I won’t be able to do them for a while Ichigo Ukitake! Let me return this to you You dropped it in the Precipice  World, didn’t you Oh… You saved us again Thank you Don’t mention it I have one for you, too No thanks! I have something a lot better! Okay, let’s all head back  to the World of the Living! -Right -Right! "
" Hado Number 33: Sokatsui! Are you okay My bad I got caught off guard Honestly… You could’ve easily dodged  that attack with Flash Step I figured I could manage  without using it Instead, you nearly  got yourself killed Listen, your… What N-Nothing It’s you guys again!

Kuchiki, about Kurosaki’s  Spiritual Pressure… I know It’s reaching its limit The Spiritual Pressure that was  restored using the Mod Soul was temporary His Spirit Energy is dropping rapidly He’s probably unable to  do even a Flash Step… Then why do you allow Kurosaki  to continue fighting In his condition, he’ll… I know! I know that I understand your situation Kuchiki…you need to keep  Ichigo from fighting any more But what about Ichigos feelings I’m aware of that However, he is losing his Spirit Energy  far sooner than we had anticipated It’s too dangerous I understand There you are! Why’re you staring  blankly out into space It’s nothing Really You’ve been  acting strange lately No I haven’t Then why won’t you  look me in the face You’ve been like  that for a while now There’s something you want  to tell me, isn’t there Yeah It’s okay You don’t  have to tell me What! What’s with you First you tell me to say it,  then you tell me not to! Sorry… I just wanted to be sure Quit messing with me!

You’re late, Kuchiki! What… What’s going on Isn’t it obvious It’s ice-skating No, what I meant was You were staring at this  place the other day So I thought you wanted  to go ice-skating Huh Dummy… What Nothing It gets really pretty here  during springtime with all the cherry blossoms in bloom Then again, we can just  ask Byakuya and have him show us cherry blossoms  anytime we want, huh What do you think my brother is!

Don’t be silly That’s impossible But it is! Wow! It’s pretty! Why are there fireworks  at this time of year A theme park opened recently nearby They do fireworks every  day at about this hour There’s a place like that now What You didn’t know It’s not big, but it’s  a pretty nice date spot Just the other day, I  went there with Chad! It was fun It’s nice to spend time  like this for a change Yeah See you! Bye-bye! Yeah, later That was quite fun Coming from you, that was a good idea You just can’t come out  and compliment me, can you By the way, something’s  been bugging me What is it That time… How did you know where I was I had lost control of myself back there, so I should have been difficult  to recognize, right I wonder… Huh You don’t know! Compared to when we first  met, you became stronger Your Spiritual Pressure  went to a whole new level But you didn’t change at all Huh What’re you… A Hollow! You need to keep Ichigo  from fighting any more Ichigo, wait! What’s the matter I can feel its Spiritual Pressure  all the way over here! It’s a pretty big one! Let’s go! Ichigo! Damn! It dodged me like I was nothing Ichigo! Oh, no… His Spiritual Pressure’s… Damn…not now… Come on! It’s huge Sorry, I’m getting in your way You fool! Don’t say that! You’re not in my way!

Rukia…can you stop its legs Yes, leave it to me! Dance, Sodenoshirayuki Tsuginomai, Hakuren! This is my last time! Ichigo… Here goes! Getsuga… tensho! Ichigo! Are you okay! Just barely Honestly, you’re  always going overboard It’s like you just said… No matter what happens,  I’ll always be me So don’t hide stuff  that you have to say You…knew about my mission I can sort of guess what the old  man and the others are thinking Ichigo… I’ve put you through  a lot, haven’t I Ichigo! What’s wrong! Are you okay! Yeah Sorry I made you tag along  with me until the very end Don’t say that… You…fool… We’re friends Don’t forget that I know that… Now, rest… Ichigo, you’re right… No matter what happens,  we won’t change Kurosaki! Huh What Is this my place Yeah Oh yeah! My powers… Ichigo… Your body is going through the second  stage of Spiritual Pressure loss Soon, your remaining Spiritual  Pressure will be gone, as well I see I knew it I figured it was about that time… Can I go outside I don’t sense any spirit presence Even Rukia’s presence is  gradually fading away… I really am…losing my powers… This is goodbye, Ichigo… Looks that way… Hey, don’t make such a sad face Even if you can’t see me, I’ll  still be able to see you What the hell That doesn’t make me happy at all And I’m not making  a sad face, either! Give everybody…my regards I will… Bye, Rukia Thank you There’s no more reason for me  to stay at Ichigo’s place Then I’ll take you in! I just came up with a  new design for you! Wait! Let me cuddle him! I can’t give up on this one,  even if it’s against you, Sado! Please! Don’t fight over me! You’re both creeping me out! Up until now, my life’s  been nothing but fighting… Starting with the next episode, I’m going to make the most  out of my high-school life! We still haven’t done  our sports festival… And I also want to do  the cultural festival Oh, and then there’s  the class trip… Brother!

" Rise and shine, Big Brother! Get up! ICHIGO KUROSAKI: 17 YEARS OLD HAIR COLOR: ORANGE EYE COLOR: BROWN OCCUPATION: Still sleepy… HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT HE CANNOT SEE GHOSTS Ta-da! Oh yeah, today’s your  school entrance ceremony Karin, pass the soy sauce Here’s your soy sauce! What’re you so angry about, Yuzu I’m not angry! I saved showing you how I look in my uniform until the day  of my entrance ceremony, but you won’t even look at me! See if I care! I’m not serving you the tastiest  scorched portion of the rice! Your skirt’s unzipped See I am looking Dummy! You’re so dirty-minded! My glasses! What’s the matter, Karin Nothing Yuzu! Check this out, Yuzu! How’s this suit look Which matches better, this  necktie or this bowtie They both look okay Doesn’t matter Doesn’t matter! Yuzu! Don’t be like that Come on, take a good look! Yeah, that’s fine Whatever Whatever! Thanks for breakfast It’s been 17 months—a little  over a year—since that battle… I’m in my last year of high school Chad and Inoue apparently told everyone about my Soul Reaper powers They said everyone  believed them right away Seeing stuff like that happen  right before your eyes doesn’t leave much  doubt, though, you know Despite that, everyone  accepted me without a word… that was cool ‘Morning But now, I no longer possess Soul Reaper powers Ever since I lost my Spirit Energy, Karin’s own Spirit  Energy became stronger… Have a good day, Big Brother! I will You take care, okay! Nowadays, the high-level  spirit medium abilities -belong to Karin -See you! She’s not too thrilled about it, -but she doesn’t come  to me for advice -Hey, wait up! Seems like she’s working  her way through it okay Let’s go, Mizuiro! Okay Ichigo! What’s up I’ll see you guys later Yeah See you at lunch! Ichigo! Ichigo! I’m tapping! I’m tapping out! ‘Morning Oh Ichigo, did you bring  the game I lent you The new one’s coming out  soon, so I need it back Yeah, I have it right here What You forgot it Shut up I brought it with me! Here! Since losing my Soul Reaper powers, the Combat Pass appears to have  ceased functioning, as well The visual barrier’s gone, and  the Hollow alarm won’t sound It’s become a mere piece of wood— I even forgot I had put  it in my school bag Now, the only thing left to show  that I was once a Soul Reaper is this thing in my hand Ishida! Where do you  think you’re going! To the nurse’s office! Now Ishida is eliminating the  Hollows that I used handle You’d think he could  just let Imoyama do it, but the guy seems even less  capable than we thought I hope he doesn’t overdo things  and upset the Soul Society… Ever since that day, Rukia hasn’t been back  to Karakura Town even once Any plans on what to do for your future You mean like after high school What do you mean “like”!  What else is there We still have time After this semester, we  have career counseling It’s time you start thinking about it You had good grades at the start, but your grades fell from the second  half of your first school year… Quit reminding me I had a lot going on back then It couldn’t be helped Besides, I’m still above average I wonder how Rukia is doing these days Why’re you bringing up Rukia now You know… because I think she could  at least drop by sometimes Since then, she hasn’t  dropped by even once Don’t you think that’s cold She’s not being cold She was relieved of her  Karakura Town duties Not coming back is normal Don’t you miss her Of course not It took me 16 years to  earn this normal life I hope it stays peaceful  like this until I die You have a good point… I don’t ever want to go through  scary stuff like that again, either That’s right I never once felt superior  because I could see ghosts I never thought of making a living  from it or using it to help others All I ever yearned for was a  life without seeing ghosts I got the life I yearned for Hey! Damn it you! Wait, you! Give me back my bag! Mizuiro Come to think of it… Hold this Stop! There’s one other thing I still have that proves I was once a Soul Reaper The physical training I did and the  reflexes I developed in order to win come in handy sometimes Whoa! That was pretty awesome, kid! Thanks! You hungry I’ll buy you ramen Come on No thanks I want to avoid getting  scolded afterwards Please don’t tell anyone  that I hit somebody Oh Sure… I see…too bad Let’s go, Mizuiro, Keigo Well, what do you know You’re rather cautious… Ichigo Kurosaki How long do you plan  on sleeping, Ichigo! Do I have to slug you! Come on, wake up, Ichigo Kurosaki You fool! Get up, Ichigo! Get up! I-chi-go… Y-You idiot! You really are an idiot! I could’ve fallen! You could’ve killed me! Big deal If you die, you’ll go to  the Soul Society, right Talking big now, eh Look, you’re not going to die  falling from the second floor Because of you, I had a weird dream To apologize, hurry up and fall Stop that! I’ll fall!! You’re going to make  me fall for real!! A weird dream What about I don’t remember Trying to tell you made me forget So what’s your offer F-Five thousand yen… Five thousand yen per week! Get real! Next! Here! I’m Satoda, vice-captain  of the soccer team! We’d like to borrow your  skills, Mr Kurosaki… Just say how long and how much -We soccer team have prepared  a budget of two… -Ichigo… -Huh -He’s talking business -no, 15 times that of the basketball  team you helped out last time -He’ll be a while -Oh, I see -Please help us out! -So he’s done renting himself  out to the basketball team This sucks… I won’t have Ichigo  to hang out with again You make it sound like he  hangs with you all the time Uh…that’s right, he does! It’s not like I have nothing better to do than making a nuisance of myself by bugging Ichigo at his  part time jobs all the time! -It’s true, it’s true,  it’s so true, I swear! -If you say so -What’s my position We’d like you to be our goalkeeper! Chad would make a better goalkeeper Mr Sado turned us down saying  he found a better-paying job! So I’m his follow up Was Ichigo always so  obsessed with money He’s probably saving  up for after he graduates so he can live on his own What! You mean he’s moving out! No, that I don’t know Whatever the case, Ichigo’s old man  doesn’t seem like the type who’d loan Ichigo money for anything, so I think it’s a good idea  for him to save up now Oh… You might be right about that Thank you very much! We did it! Okay! Let’s go tell our captain! You decided on the soccer team For how much That’s a secret When do you start Today Huh! What happened to basketball My contract ended last week What about you No after-school sports I have my part-time job to go to Didn’t I tell you Since last month, I’ve been  assistant instructor at my dojo You’re the assistant instructor I’m glad I quit your dojo I refuse to call you Sensei Shall I force you to  call me that right now It’s Miss Inoue… She’s gorgeous… Like an idol… The first time I saw her, I thought, “Man, am I glad I came  to this high school!” I took a picture of her the  other day with my cell phone Really Send it to me!! Huh Kurosaki! Tatsuki! Oh, Inoue… Stupid! That’s dangerous!  You’ll fall! We can see your panties! Ouch! You deserved it! The next time you do  something that dangerous, I’ll hit you even harder! Harder than just now! You’ll crack open my head! You don’t have to  get so angry about it! She didn’t hurt herself Shut up! You have no business lecturing me about how to teach Orihime a lesson! I didn’t lecture you! I’m saying I feel sorry for Inoue! That’s what I call lecturing! Uh…the thing is… I want to ask the two  of you for your advice Advice Yes Its about… my life’s theme,  “The Hahaha Song,” where I cheer on comedians who have  the right amount of popularity by matching them to the tune  of the Do-Re-Mi song… “Right amount of  popularity” What the hell The problem is, recently, all  I’m able to do is hum it! Isn’t that a good thing Why do you think that’s so! You’ve grown up Wrong! How do you do that! Your eyes look like the number 3! Orihime’s gotten a lot  better at making faces… The correct answer is! Because I don’t know whether I should start at “Do” with  Dokurodan or Doburock! Which do you think would be better It doesn’t matter! Oh! I just remembered! I don’t have time for this! What’s the matter, Tatsuki My part-time job! Weren’t you working, too, Orihime You’d better get going You sure are busy Hang in there You act like none of this concerns you, but did you let your boss know Didn’t your boss chew you  out for not doing that before If you don’t give her proper notice, don’t say I didn’t warn you Mr Kurosaki! Please join us at practice! Mr Kurosaki… Huh You dumb ass! Do you realize what you’re asking! You took off last week, and came to work only  one day after that, and now you want to take  off another week again! That’s why I’m apologizing… Do you think an apology  makes it all okay!

What’s the point of me worrying  It’s just the two of us today If it bugs you that much, I’ll  leave you to yourself… No, don’t do that! I wonder if Ichigo’s okay, though… I’m sure he is It just seemed like something came up Came up You mean like, how he gets in a fight  with a gang of punks out for revenge and then gets swept away  by some crazy woman Fights and a part-time job… He’s living the teen life Getting kidnapped is his part-time job! You call that teen life! How is that “living the life”! What’s the matter I could’ve sworn we  were being followed… Followed We’re not Ichigo, I can’t see  why anyone would be after us… Look out! Above you! That was close… I thought I was gonna pee my pants… Are you kids all right! Just barely… Hey! Who did that! Watch  what you’re doing! In any case, thanks Were you the one who was  following us, Arisawa Huh Following you  What’re  you talking about I was just passing by It looked to me like someone tried to drop a steel beam on you two… On us Don’t scare us like that… Oh dear…you failed It must suck to be turned  away bearing a gift That’s what you get for being mean and not showing us what  that Ichigo guy looks like! How very true What’d you come for I thought I told you  two not to follow me Oh did you now! We’re in this together  You’re not our boss We don’t take orders from you In the first place, you  have no persuasive skills! Let me do it! I’ll persuade him in no time! If I recall, he persuaded  us to work for him Shut up, Giriko! You’re the only one he persuaded! He didn’t persuade me,  and I don’t work for him! And besides… Put a sock in it That’s enough Let’s go I don’t like clinging to the past… So long… Welcome home, Big Brother! Look! My very first test! I scored a 95! Aren’t I awesome! PRAISE ME Way to go! Go and show Dad! He’ll be very happy! Speaking of Dad, where’d he go! I don’t know Seems like he’s been  out since morning That so… Well, I’ll be in my room Oh…Big Brother… What is it, Yuzu Never mind…it’s nothing My face still looks flushed… All I was going to do  was give him the bread at the door and ask him a question… Come on in How was I supposed to say no! WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED Wanna come in  And then Kurosaki tells me  to take home what I want! He’s so sweet! So sweet! SWEET! S-W-E-E-T… S-W-E… Ouch! S-Sorry about that, Big Brother… Say…  Kurosaki… Has anything  happened to you recently  Not really  What makes you ask such a question  Kurosaki… You’re keeping something  from me, aren’t you You’ll be fine  You’ll be fine  That startled me… Who could be calling at this hour You’ll be fine  Oh, it’s Ishida You’ll be fine  Hello What is it, Ishida UTAMARO ENRAKU I see…uh…huh What! Where’s Brother Ichi Upstairs… I called him, but he  said he’d eat later Oh yeah That’s what’s wrong  with adolescent boys… They’re all pervs Karin! Mind not talking about  such things right now And besides, our brother  isn’t like that! Okay, okay But you know, Yuzu, you  should stop holding on to these illusions  about Brother Ichi He’s a guy, like everyone else He’s not some anime character I mean… I don’t think of him like that! I’ve heard enough! What! No, I didn’t mean to… I was just teasing you, Yuzu! C’mon! I don’t care! Tonight, you’re doing  the dishes, Karin! Good grief… Looks like Brother Ichi gave  her the brush off again… Better have him go and smooth  her ruffled feathers later… Yuzu Brother Ichi Hey, wait up! Where’re you going! Brother Ichi! GENERAL HOSPITAL Ishida!! Kurosaki! Inoue! You’re already here Where’s Chad He didn’t answer his phone He’s probably working at the  construction site at this hour You even contacted Kurosaki Man…that was so unnecessary Ishida… Unnecessary, he says… As always, he still talks big I thought I wasn’t  supposed to have visitors What if my wounds get worse from having all these people come in Are you an idiot Who do you think operated on you Something like this won’t  worsen your wounds A novice who nearly died because  he was cut down by an enemy shouldn’t go telling  a doctor what not to do W-Wait a minute Cut down…by an enemy! What’s he talking about, Ishida! It’s none of your business… What do you mean it’s  not my business! You were cut down! If you can’t handle it yourself, then we’ll have to do  something about it together! Say something! Sharing information is vital Are you going to let my  kind efforts go to waste You keep out of this! Oh…that was so close… An utterance another five  hertz higher in pitch would’ve ripped the sutures… Ishida… I’m sorry, Inoue… Right now, I really don’t  have anything to say… Go on home All right… URYU ISHIDA KARAKURA GENERAL HOSPITAL Kurosaki Oh… right! Sorry you had to come  out this late, Inoue Let me take you home Huh! No, I… Uh…really! I’ll take her home in my car You should get home quickly Your old man seems like the type who’d give me grief if  I kept you out too late I understand Thank you very much Kurosaki! See you tomorrow at school! Hey No shouting in the hospital Oh! I’m sorry It doesn’t look like he’ll be  much help, so I’ll tell only you… Uryu wasn’t cut down by a Hollow But it wasn’t by a  Soul Reaper, either I checked the residual Spiritual  Pressure on his wounds, but… To be honest, I don’t know if it  could be called “Spiritual Pressure” It was a kind of Spiritual Pressure  I’ve never felt before What does that mean Don’t ask What I’m telling you  is everything I know Uryu himself probably knows  nothing about his assailant It’s not that he didn’t  tell you anything There was nothing that he could tell you But… Anyway, what is clear is that  you people are in danger Any idea who might be responsible No… This is only conjecture, but… The enemy, who possesses some power we know nothing about, is probably… Human Someone less Soul Reaper like, and more like you and Sado Uryu, a Quincy, generally falls  into that category, as well If we’re to assume that Uryu was attacked by someone going  after humans like themselves, then it means the next one to be  in danger is either you or Sado I’ll see you home now Hey!  Wait! I said, wait! Don’t you understand the  meaning of “wait”! What do you want Want Do I have to want something  just to talk to you You fool Don’t stop me just for  something like that Besides, who… are you, anyway I’m… Looks like things aren’t  going as you had planned Well, that’s okay Let’s try a different approach Let’s eat What’s the matter Hurry up and eat R-Right… I know… What do you say we go  shopping after school today Didn’t you say there  were things you wanted -Yeah… -Yeah… Bowling Yeah! This is our last school year, right College entrance exams and stuff  are just around the corner… This is our only chance  to go and have fun! Why do we have to try so  hard to create memories Why not just do the stuff we always do You don’t get it, do you, Ichigo! Theres no telling what might  happen to us at any time! I mean, just yesterday What happened Just yesterdayuh He thought a girl from another  school was following him, but it turned out to be Arisawa R-Right! Right! Funny, right Whatever… I promised to take my  sisters shopping today Sorry We don’t need to tell him, right No, we don’t Yuzu! Big Brother! Where’s Karin She’ll be a bit late, so she said  to go on ahead to the store I see Oh well Shall we go Okay… Isn’t that… The punk from the other day Why is he looking at us Ichigo! Weren’t you with Asano and the others No, I already had plans to  go shopping with my sisters Hello Hey What’s up I told them I’d join them later, but  I can’t get in touch with them They’re out of phone range, maybe I hope that’s all it is But after what happened yesterday Yesterday What’re you talking about They haven’t told you Someone is targeting them! No I don’t know, but You’d better go, Big Brother Yuzu They’re your friends, right Go to them Sorry about this, Yuzu Let’s go, Tatsuki! R-Right Damn it! I can’t reach them! Tatsuki, we’ll split up! You check the vicinity  of the bowling alley Got it Right! I’ll search the area where  they were attacked yesterday It’s the construction  site over at third street! Got it! Keigo! Mizuiro! Look out! So you’re the one! Why’re you after these guys! Are you that intent on  taking revenge against me! Revenge It’s nothing like that I was justasked by someone to do it Asked by someone! Bastard! If only I didn’t have to hold this up! Helpless, are you I’m going to take down your  friends one after the other! And thenlastly, your family What! Don’t mess with me! Hey you… Who asked you to… Who’re you Damn! Hey! Stop! Damn it! Let him go Ishida’s He sensed my Spiritual  Pressure and disappeared  Why’re you here I just happened by Who was that guy Probably some punks looking for a fight That’s not what happened! Are they the ones who  got Ishida, as well! These two are okay They’re unconscious,  but mostly unharmed I’ll call an ambulance  just to be safe As for you, don’t get  involved any further I can’tno way! Then let me ask you this What can you do What the hell’s going on, damn it! What’s happening that  I don’t know about! Isn’t there anything I can do!

" What the hell’s going on, damn it! What’s happening that  I don’t know about! Isn’t there anything I can do! Heres some advice  Act now while you can Thats if you want to  protect your family  You have reached Xcution  This number is unregistered  Are you a new member  Please state your name  IchigoKurosaki Mr Ichigo Kurosaki   We were expecting your call  Welcome to Xcution  Please redial this number  followed by the digits “00800”  Huh Next, please hang up your phone  before the second ring tone ends  Your call will be placed  on your third try  That was a pain in the ass Don’t say that If I didn’t do that, it’d  be a pain in the ass for me I need to talk to you I thought so Otherwise, you wouldn’t have called Kurosaki! Kurosaki! Know anything about Sado Your question is too broad Know what about him About his condition! Condition Did he catch a cold or something Oh… Then you don’t know, either I thought I should tell him about  what happened to Ishida yesterday, so I went to his class… Seems Sado hasn’t been  coming to school recently I thought you might know  something about him, but… I seeso you don’t know, either… Maybe I’ll visit Sado at home  today with a get-well gift… S-Say… Would you like to join me, Kurosaki Sorry I have plans today Oh…Okay! Of course! This was so sudden! All right, I’ll go and let you  know tomorrow how Sado’s doing! Yeah, thanks Something happened to Chad, too  What the hell is going on!  Today’s too soon  How about tomorrow  8 pm tomorrow  Come to the front of the  dilapidated apartment  building located at 7-1  Seventh street in Chobara  District, Naruki City I’ll hear what you have to say there  Relax  I think I’ll be able to help you  Sado! Hey! Sado! You there! Maybe he’s not home If we’re to assume that Uryu was attacked by someone going  after humans like themselves, then it means the next one to be  in danger is either you, or Sado… No! No! I mustn’t think like that! I pray that Sado will be back at  school tomorrow feeling better! Here is some tasty bread!  Enjoy it and get well Seventh street… 7-1… Dilapidated apartments… This must be the place Hey Five minutes early… Very punctual… Not five minutes Three So, what did you want to talk about My friends were attacked So I want your help To find who did it I thought you don’t trust me You know about me and about my dad You’re no ordinary human Think so It’s not that I trust you… But you’re the only guy… You can ask Is that it Fine Follow me Although I wish we could’ve  taken care of my request first You mean about my dad Don’t give me such a scary look There’s no need for you  to check on him anymore That was just a pretext  to draw your attention A pretext We’re here Slide the card here It’s big… We knocked out five rooms on each side and three  stories above and below One of our members is  a sort of wealthy… Now then, before we  get to our main topic, let me tell you our objective Your objective Yeah… Our objective in approaching you It’s to restore your  Soul Reaper powers God, you’re unbelievable! What kind of person sleeps  in a place like that! You’re a grown man!  What are you, stupid For crying out loud! You know what it’s like  having to go look for you! I never imagined you’d  be in a place like that! Come to think of it, why did he  send me to find you, anyway! Ginjo should do it himself! Right! Hey! Why don’t you say something! It’s your fault that  I’m so upset, you know! Come on! You do think, don’t you! Damn you! Oww! What’s wrong I’m sure you’re not deaf Our objective is to restore  your Soul Reaper powers You heard right But…how How are you going to restore them! Why’re you doing this! For what purpose! Who the hell are you people Calm down I can’t answer your questions if you ask them all at once Sit down The night is long I’ll explain nice and slow Want something to drink Why’re you looking at me like that I wouldn’t serve a minor alcohol You’re not a drinker, right You seem more straight-laced  than you look Anything you want We don’t have a menu, but  we have pretty much anything No thanks Okay, serve him some orange  juice or something Coming up We’re humans Of course, as you say, we are  not “ordinary” humans We’re humans born with  a certain special ability Special ability Showing you would be faster What I just did was draw out  the “soul” of the liquor in the glass to “help” me drink it Our ability is drawing out the “soul” in an object and  putting that object to use You have a puzzled look on your face Did you think that only  living things had souls Each and every object in  this world has a soul, not just animals and plants It might be tiny, but a telephone pole, a chair,  even a glass, possesses a soul Ever felt like you can  perform much better than usual when using a tool you’re  comfortable working with That shows you understand  that tool’s “soul” An object’s soul is imbued  with the power to help its user We have the ability to draw that out, give it a boost with our own soul, and turn it into a greater power I can draw out the soul of asphalt and augment its repulsive  force to jump higher… With a liquid, as you just saw, I can make it leap into my mouth or make it support my feet so that I can stand on water And, if it is an object I am  familiar and compatible with, I can even change its form In my case, it’s this necklace What’s happening Like so We call this ability “Fullbring” Fullbring I’m back! Riruka You’re back earlier than I expected Did you find him I sure did! Hey, that’s your sword glowing  over there, isn’t it What’s it doing out Are you stupid! God, it’s so dark in here! Add more lights right now! I can’t see a thing! I have no plans to add lights Put on some glasses… I hate glasses! But I hate contacts even more! As soon as I put contacts  in they make my eyes dry! ‘Cuz I have big eyes! Nobody asked Who is that Riruka Dokugamine She’s one of us What! Who’s there! I’ll introduce you later Now hurry up and bring him inside Don’t boss me around! Hey, come on in! What! Chad! Ichigo… What are you doing here! You haven’t even been  coming to school… So why What the hell is going on! You bastard! Calm down, Ichigo How can I be calm! Explain! Depending on your answer, I… Calm down Don’t make me say it a third time If you’ll hear me through,  you’ll understand Sit You too, Chad What You guys know each other! I wasn’t aware of that! Did you know that, Ginjo! Don’t tell me I was the  only one kept in the dark! A drink for Chad, too Ignoring me! Wait! Ichigo You mean that’s  Ichigo Kurosaki there! Turn up the lights! I  can’t see his face!! Later Why! Okay… Now that everyone’s here, let’s  get down to the main topic… All right, now I’m so pissed! Show me your face! He’s so hot! He’s so hot! Hey, are you okay I’m… I’m not okay Ignore her Ichigo, let’s talk  about our main topic Uh, right… Before you do that, Mr Ginjo, would you mind putting the sword away Good idea Be sure to pay for the  floor tiles later Good idea… Do you understand our power now that you’ve seen it  with your own eyes Yeah… Good Now we can move on Do you know why a Hollow  has a hole in its chest What’re you talking about The pain of not being  saved by a Soul Reaper tears out its heart and leaves a hole… But where does that heart go The lost heart becomes its mask Not just its mask A Hollow’s unique appearance  and unique powers are all created from the  heart that was torn out All of our parents were attacked by Hollows before we were born Vestiges of Hollow powers were left behind in the mothers  who were attacked The power inside of us when we were born was more like that of a Hollow  rather than of a Soul Reaper We found our power loathsome Ichigo, you once possessed  Hollow powers yourself You must understand how we feel We want to rid ourselves  of this loathsome power Over the course of many years, we gradually gathered  others with like powers And that led us to a discovery With our exact opposite That is, someone who possesses  both Soul Reaper and human powers, we can exchange powers Are you saying There was someone… One other person who, like you, was born of a Soul Reaper  and a human being By yielding our powers to that person, a number of our members in the past were able to return to  being ordinary humans Do you understand For us to return to  being ordinary humans, it is necessary for you to regain  your Soul Reaper powers That’s not the answer I want to hear What I want to know what’s happening  to me and my friends Whether I regain my Soul  Reaper powers or not is beside the point So you’re saying you don’t  want your Soul Reaper powers Crap, I left something  at Ginjo’s place I better call him… You have reached Xcution  Yes, hi, I left something at… Mr Ichigo Kurosaki  Yeah, I left something… “00800”  I have to do this over again! Xcution Dictionary! Today, I’ll introduce our members Giriko Kutsuzawa Giriko Kutsuzawa! He pisses me off sometimes because  I can’t tell what he’s thinking! Jackie Tristan Jackie Tristan! The way she dresses to flaunt her  figure pisses me off big time! Yukio Yukio! The way this kid talks back  at me really pisses me off! Riruka Dokugamine And Riruka Dokugamine A troublesome woman who can’t  speak her honest feelings God, you piss me off! "
" For us to return to  being ordinary humans, it is necessary for you to regain  your Soul Reaper powers That’s not the answer I want to hear What I want to know what’s happening  to me and my friends Whether I regain my Soul  Reaper powers or not, is beside the point You’re okay with letting  him leave like that Yeah… We told him out of the blue to  become a Soul Reaper again— an immediate answer would  be asking too much You of all people should understand Becoming a Soul Reaper again  was never on his mind But he thought we might know something regarding the incidents that suddenly  began happening around him Even so, he decided to approach us We’ve made great progress We can’t afford to fail We can’t let this chance slip by Is that really so I don’t think that guy  is worth all the trouble Besides, wanting to restore his powers  for your personal reasons and whether he can actually be of  help to us are two different things Then again, it seems like some of  us are already interested in him, so in that regard, I might  be different from you guys Huh! What, were you referring to me! She didn’t say that I don’t think he’s  worth all the risk either! But we do need his powers, don’t we So says the one who is all hyper  after seeing him in person Shush! I’m always hyper! Now, now… Then what do you guys think! Well, Yukio! Don’t care… Don’t care And you, Giriko! It’s clear that… we do need him You’ll pay for this! Oh, good… The Soul Reapers haven’t  found you yet… Who the hell…are you! It must be agonizing to  carry such a grudge… I will free you In exchange… Will you do as I ask Please See you tomorrow! I came because you asked me  to, but what is all of this Shh! Not so loud! He’ll hear us! We’re going to confirm with  our own eyes whether or not that guy is really somebody we need! You’re totally into this guy That’s not so! He’ll hear you He turned the corner Let’s go! I don’t think so Count me out Come in Hi… Inoue I came to see how you’re doing What’s this I figured you’ve got a lot  of free time in the hospital, so I chose some DVD’s  featuring young entertainers who might have a breakout  in another two years… Uh…Thanks… How’re you feeling I’m doing good It still hurts, though… If it’s that bad, shall I heal you Thanks, but that’s okay… I have my reasons So You didn’t come just  to see how I was, did you When they found you collapsed, you weren’t very far from  Kurosaki’s home, right I was wondering why you were there… Could it have been because, like me, you sensed something  going on around Kurosaki, and… No, it was just a coincidence It’s true that I did sense some kind of Spiritual  Pressure around Kurosaki, but it had nothing to do with  the guy who attacked me Really Yeah… More importantly… Was that a! It’s a Hollow! And it’s nearby! You mustn’t, Ishida! I’ll go and take a look! You, Inoue! I’ll be fine! I won’t do anything dangerous! I’ll be back! Okay… She’s right, a Hollow like  this should be no problem… But… what worries me is… He startled me! Why’d he suddenly… What’s this presence I feel! Kurosaki! Inoue What’s wrong Why’re  you so flustered Hey! Don’t move! Is it a Hollow! Huh Must’ve been my imagination Is it always like this for you Of course not! I usually let Ishida and  Sado take care of it Really! Inoue… Anyway, what were you  doing here, Kurosaki Oh, you know… -But what about you, Inoue -Who is she! -Huh, me! Thanks for walking me back Bye Yeah, see you tomorrow I don’t like clinging to the past… So you’re saying you don’t  want your Soul Reaper powers I’m not asking for  an immediate answer I’ll wait until tomorrow  for your reply Think it over tonight Okay It’s true that the way I am  now, I can’t protect anyone… But I did it knowing the consequences Hey Yuzu, Brother Ichi says  he doesn’t want dinner All right Geez… And here you prepared his favorites I don’t care anymore! I think I’ll go and take a bath It appears he won’t be coming Looks like you figured wrong Won’t it become more difficult  the more you insist Here You get to eat what you  didn’t have yesterday Oh, it looks delicious By the way, Brother Ichi… Were you expecting someone last night Last night Did something happen I felt someone was in front  of the house, but… When I went outside,  there was no one there It was probably your imagination I’ll wait until tomorrow  for your reply Think it over tonight Chad… What’re you doing here By any chance, were you  at my place last night No…I didn’t Then I guess it was him Ichigo… Got a minute What about school You haven’t been coming  at all lately… Do you remember…the promise  we made in middle school Back then, you protected something  very important to me If you’re going to stake  your life to protect it, then I’ll stake my  life to protect it, too It’s a promise From that day on, you and  I have fought together, and I’ve continued to  follow you in my own way Yeah… Ichigo You might be trying to hide it, but to tell you the truth, it’s been unbearable to watch  you since you lost your powers I know you want to fight! It’s agonizing to be unable to protect everyone with your  own powers, isn’t it! You don’t have to hide it, Ichigo… Those feelings are who you are Ichigo! We’ll be late for class… So, what now There really isn’t  anything we can do I went to see him, but he  gave me no indication… Ginjo! Why didn’t you meet  with Ichigo last night Last night You went to Ichigo’s  place, didn’t you What’re you talking about I never went there I see Then who… What’s going on Ichigo’s younger sister sensed the  presence of someone around their home It’s simple What is Could it mean that someone besides us is trying to make  contact with Kurosaki Go! Go! Now that you mention it! I might’ve sensed… A strange presence near him It’s him! Hey! By the way, Brother Ichi… Were you expecting someone last night Could that have been! Hey! Damn it… Is that you, Brother I knew it! Yuzu! What’re you doing here You’re all right All right Uh…it’s nothing I was just on my way to buy groceries for  tonight’s dinner— would you come with me  to carry the packages Sure…I don’t mind What was that breeze just now Brother What! Yuzu! Brother! Brother… Something’s pulling me Stop it It’s a Hollow…no doubt about it! Let Yuzu…go! Bro…ther… Damn it… Why can’t I see it! Bro…ther… Run Stop it! Damn it! Yuzu! Yuzu! That hurt, you bastard! Ginjo! You hung in there well… Let’s go for some ramen noodles, after I take care of this guy Bastardwhy’d you  go after this girl! Yuzu! Hey! Yuzu, hang in there! Thank you I owe you…big time Hell with that I didn’t come to make  you indebted to me We can’t afford to have you die And besides… It sucks to have the door  slammed shut on us because we didn’t protect something  we could have protected You what! Are you a moron! You saved him and just came back here If we need Ichigo Kurosaki’s powers, why didn’t you tell him, “I’ll save you  if you cooperate with us” and make a deal! Sounds like you’re all for  welcoming Ichigo Kurosaki Sure does No, I’m not! I’m not getting why you’re  hanging everything on that tacky guy with orange hair! I’m not tacky! Ichigo Kurosaki! Is your sister okay Yeah… What Don’t get the wrong idea Huh I didn’t come because I owe you I want my powers back so  I can protect everyone That’s all You still won’t admit it, huh This is…my… That’s the symbol  of your power, right Keep it secure I will No one told me he’d be joining us! What Stop picking on me just  because you’re happy No one said I’m happy or anything! Or that he’s my type… Or that he has a sexy voice…  Or that he has a cute smile… I’m not thinking any of that, okay! You just explained it yourself Don’t toss that away again I won’t But where’d you find this Well… I looked where the river flowed, followed the Kuroshio Current and set out on the vast open ocean through stormy seas until at last, on a southern island, I found it Don’t toss that away again Stop lying! "
" Is your sister okay Yeah What Don’t get the wrong idea Huh I didn’t come because I owe you I want my powers back so  I can protect everyone That’s all You won’t admit it, huh This is…my… That’s the symbol of your power, right Keep it secure I will Now for todays weather  Rain clouds covering western Japan  are bringing in slightly  heavy showers to the  Shikoku region, with 10mm per hour The clouds will continue to cover  the Shikoku and Kyushu regions  Periods of rain showers will  come in through the afternoon  Yuzu, go to bed already What about you, Karin I uh…have things to do Like what It doesn’t matter If this is about Brother Ichi, I’ll stay up and chew him  out when he comes back I’m telling you to go  to bed because you have to cook and stuff in the morning! Brother’s got nothing to do with it! I’m not worried about him! It’s okay to be worried, you know! Brother Ichi’s been  acting strangely lately, and it’s only natural to worry when he comes home very late  several nights in a row! I said I’m not worried! You are! I’m not! Get off my case! What! I’m home -Brother! -Brother Ichi! What You’re both still up Go to bed already You’ll be late for school tomorrow Well Okay! -Good night, Brother! -Good night, Brother Ichi! For the past week, I did  everything you told me to do So Why am I back here again You complain, and yet you came in Thanks Shut up! You want your Soul Reaper  powers back, don’t you That’s why I’m here I thought we’d be doing some  training-type thing in a big place That’s right! We are doing some training-type  thing in a big place! What’re you staring at! Nothing… You know, Riruka… I think it’s time you  stop kicking the door open I don’t appreciate having to  see your panties every time Oh, yeah Yukio… What makes you think you  can speak to me like that You think you can say whatever you want, just because we have a guest Well, guess again! A creepy geek like you who plays video games all day has no right to  talk to me like an equal! Got that! I’ve never, then or now,  thought of you and me as equals! Sorry Could you repeat that again Oh, yeah Yukio… What  makes you think you can… You don’t have to repeat Let go of me, Jackie! All right, all right… Forget about that and get on with  explaining that box to Ichigo Stop nagging me! You don’t have to remind me  I’ll explain it right now! What’re you just standing there for! Come over here so I can explain it to you! Fine, already… And why am I being yelled at Wait! Stop! You’re fine right there! Don’t come a step closer! C’mon, make up your mind… Observe this box! I’m looking Well Well what Isn’t it cute! Huh You should be happy! This cute dollhouse is  your training facility! What You don’t have to understand! I’ll show you soon enough! Show me My Fullbring! My Fullbring is called “Dollhouse”! I have the ability to move  people or things at will into and out of objects that I  think are cute or that I love That’s your pass Okay, you can go inside now! Go inside I permit you to What’re you talking… That hurt…damn it… What just happened You’re kidding me… Well Isn’t it cute Cute, my ass! What the hell is that thing! Defeat him! What You’re so dense Fight and defeat him! That’s your training! You’ll do fine! He’s not strong, so it’ll be easy! If you can use Fullbring, that is! What! Damn it! Why’re you running away You’re pathetic! Fight him! Be a man! Are you an idiot! I can’t grasp the situation  I’m in right now! Facing him is out of the question! Explain! How did I become so tiny, and how did I get inside this toy box house! I told you That’s the power of  “Dollhouse,” my Fullbring Fullbring is the power of love Love! It’s the ability to draw  out the maximum power from something a person loves A guy like Ginjo, who only  likes his pendant, turns that into a weapon to fight with But I’m different! I have many things that I love, and I will find many more from here on! I will spend my life collecting  things that I love, and my wish is to die, smothered  by the things I love! “Dollhouse” is the ability for  things that I’ve given permission to move in and out of my favorite objects! I just gave you permission and invited  you into my favorite box here! You’re enjoying this, aren’t you Okay! Explanation’s over! Now, mind getting on with defeating this guy Don’t be chicken! You’ll be fine! It’s set up so you can defeat him  if you’re able to use Fullbring! Give it a try! Come on! Are you nuts Is Fullbring supposed to be so easy  that all I have to do is try! I thought this was supposed to be training to regain my Soul Reaper powers! Why do I have be able to use Fullbring! You sure yack a lot! Just keep quiet and do as you’re told! Do you have to have an explanation  to put your life on the line You suck! Do you realize what you’re saying You’re speaking like a dictator! Oh! You’re getting better at dodging! Shut up! Don’t just watch, at least give me a hint! It’s crazy to expect me to use Fullbring without even a clue or hint! A hint We were able to use Fullbring  from the moment we were born! How would I know any clues or hints! Are you stupid or something Hey, stupid! Damn it!  Hey…enough already, kid… Huh Stop running away and start fighting! It can talk! Of course it talks! Inside “Mr Pork” is a scary dude that I abducted from this neighborhood! You did what! Wait, this thing’s name is Mr Pork! Where’s the love in that! Stay still and let me kill you! If I don’t beat you dead within 15 minutes, this spell will become permanent and I’ll be stuck inside this goofy plushie for the rest of my life! And you threatened him with a lie! What do you mean, “goofy”! I’m sorry! Okay! That’s all the advice from me! Call me when you’re done, okay H-Hey, wait, you! Nope! Damn it, she closed it! Hey, hey! Let me out of here, hey! I think I’ll have a snack! -Let me out, damn it! -Giriko, make me some tea!! -Are you listening! I want a nice hot milk tea! The same kind they serve at  the place in Henri Dubois! Will he be all right Who knows… Stop, you! Let me beat you dead! Damn…  She has no intention of letting me  out or giving any helpful advice…  What a nasty woman  I said stop! Simply running won’t get me anywhere…  I’ve got to think of something!  Fullbring is the power of love!  The ability to draw out the maximum power  from something a person loves But it didn’t seem like Ginjo  “loves” that pendant…  If I had to say, it was more  like an “attachment”…  Which means that for me to  become able to use Fullbring,  I’ll need an object like that  Isn’t there something Something…  If you’re so worried,  why don’t you help him I’m not worried! Fine, whatever… If he’s going to get killed so easily,  then he wasn’t all that much! But Riruka… Are you really sure That plushie has a timer, right It’s going to be… 15 minutes soon Thank you for doing the shopping, Mr Chad What’s that This is crazy! You’re already starting  his Fullbring training! What do you mean “already” The sooner the better! Are you criticizing my methods, too There’s got to be something…  Ichigo! Your Combat Pass! Just a minute, Chad! What’re you doing! If you’re going to learn Fullbring, your Combat Pass is your only chance! We think alike! I was just thinking the same thing! Time is up As stipulated, because Fullbring  was not detected within 15 minutes, “Crazy Beast Mode” will be activated Pleasedon’t! This is cruel…don’t… W-What’s happening Oh… It seems the timer has been activated Hey! You didn’t tell me he was  going to become that hideous! What were you thinking, Giriko! My, my… You were the one who asked my help in training Mr Ichigo, Miss Riruka Yes, but… You didn’t have to make it so hideous There must’ve been any  number of other ways! Well, I couldn’t think of any… Look, you Riruka! Let Ichigo out of this box right now! You mustn’t Like the plushie, that box  has a timer on it as well “If the organism inside  can survive for 30 minutes, then it can exit the box” What kind of condition is that! You left the conditions up to me as well Removing Mr Ichigo from the box now  would be a violation of the terms If you do that, the god of  time will seek retribution God of time I believe this is the first  time I told you about it The timer is set such that, in the event of a breach,  all objects being timed will be burned away without  a trace by the Flame of Time You’re bluffing! You can believe me or not, that is up to you It’s not a bluff I’ve seen it happen many times… Convinced Just so you understand, let me repeat myself If, before another 15 minutes go by, either Mr Ichigo or Mr Pork  is removed from the box, Mr Ichigo, Mr Pork and the box, all three will be consumed  by the Flame of Time That is my Fullbring,  “Time Tells No Lies” Deactivate it! That is impossible Once set, Time Tells No  Lies cannot be undone, even by myself, who controls its power A mistake in setting the terms… leads to death Don’t ever take it lightly Meddling with time is a frightening thing Oh… Looks like the next tea is ready Would you like another cup, Miss Riruka Ah…a wonderful aroma God dwells in exact time What do I do  If I’m to manifest this Fullbring  thing using my Combat Pass…  How do I do it  Fullbring is…  Our ability is drawing out the  “soul” in an object and  putting that object to use I have to draw out the  soul of the Combat Pass  How am I supposed to do that!  How!  Your pride! When I first became able to  use Brazo Derecho Del Gigante, what was in my heart was pride! The material that forms  the basis for my Fullbring is the skin on my two arms! Skin! My skin is on the dark side because  I have Mestizo blood in me! My appearance! My big body! They’ve caused me lots of difficult times! But I never lost the pride I had in my skin! I was able to be proud… because of my Abuelo! My grandfather gave me  the strength to be proud! Think back, Ichigo! Remember the time when you were proud of your Soul Reaper powers! The Combat Pass will respond to your heart! Remember! Ichigo!! When I was proud of my Soul Reaper powers  There were…  Too many times to count! If I lose this fight, I’ll be stuck  like this for the rest of my life! It’s okay You’ll turn back to normal I swear that chick is an evil witch! I’m going to be stuck like this until I get a kiss from the person  who knows true love! Look at you, you’re a damn pork! I heard that the patient in the private room is the  hospital director’s son! Then if I can make him mine,  I’d be like Cinderella! But isn’t he still a high school student Don’t you see… Those studious types are all the  more worthwhile to seduce… you know! So… Why are you bringing me my meal A patient mustn’t complain to his doctor URYU ISHIDA NO VISITORS ALLOWED – FROM THE HOSPITAL DIRECTOR Hurry and eat your meal quietly! URYU ISHIDA NO VISITORS ALLOWED – FROM THE HOSPITAL DIRECTOR  NO CHILD KNOWS HOW DEAR HE IS TO HIS PARENTS "
" Time is up As stipulated, because Fullbring  was not detected within 15 minutes, “Crazy Beast Mode” will be activated Pleasedon’t! This is cruel…don’t… W-What’s happening What do I do If I’m to manifest this Fullbring  thing using my Combat Pass… How do I do it Your pride! Think back, Ichigo! Remember the time when you were  proud of your Soul Reaper powers! The Combat Pass will respond to your heart! Remember! Ichigo! When I… was proud of my Soul Reaper powers There were… Too many times to count! This is Zangetsu’ssword guard! Is that Ichigo’s Fullbring! That’s right Just as every battle you’ve  fought is etched into your soul, it is etched into the soul  of the tool in your hand Each time you hold the  Combat Pass after a battle, the Combat Pass etches the memory  of that battle into its soul That is the biggest  advantage to guys who have fought countless battles  when they achieve Fullbring Even though you’ve lost your powers your Combat Pass still remembers Ichigo! Crap… Guess that wasn’t the way to use it The guard-shaped Spiritual Pressure  only comes out when I’m holding it… It didn’t cut him So this guard doesn’t  have that kind of power I should’ve known You can’t cut somebody with just the guard In that case Butjust as I thought, it  can be used just like a guard! That sensation just now Nice I can tell your mind is becoming  sharper as the fight goes on Unlike a minute ago, when  you could do nothing at all, a tiny light of hope has turned you  into a totally different fighter Is it from your experience, or from instinct I wonder… Ichigo I can do this That sensation was definitely… You idiot! You’re going in too deep! That sensation of Getsugatensho! He He did it You did it, Ichigo! With this With this, I might really be able to regain my Soul Reaper powers! Hey! I passed, right Let me out of here already Oh, fine already Not yet Giriko! If that was truly Fullbring, the terms of the timer  have been met and Mr Pork lying there should return to normal We must see that take place  before we release him See! He’s back to normal! Let me out of here! Okayall right, already! I’ll let you out now! You seem so happy What’re you doing Oh, boy How’s that! Sneezing on the object undoes my Dollhouse! I got that without your explanation! Look at me! I’m soaked! Need a towel What do you think! You knew this would happen but  kept quiet, didn’t you! I didn’t know how to make the  Spiritual Pressure subside, but it did that by itself… Is there a time limit to  the Spiritual Pressure What That can’t be! Ichigo wouldn’t… I can’t hear it anymore… What was that That sounded like…Rukia’s voice! What’s going on Her But she’s a girl… Yes, you’re right She’s our next target to defeat I see… You don’t have to do  anything, Shishigawara You can’t attack girls, can you That’s not so! Kurosaki didn’t come  to school today either… And Sado still hasn’t come back… I’m worried The bread I left for Sado was gone, so I guess he does come home once in a while I’ll make myself useful! I will beat her to death no matter what and prove useful to Mr Tsukishima! Hello! I’m Shishigawara from  Miyashita High School! Sorry! Do you mind dying a little Making the first move is  what’s important in a fight! Now turn around! Hurry up and turn around! The moment she turns around… I’ll clobber her! BULL’S-EYE Knock out! She’s hot! Hey, c’mon, man… What’s with that! She’s too hot! Is she really human! She’s so hot, she blew me away! N-No, no, no! My eyes must be playing tricks on me! No way anybody can be so hot! Maybe my senses are shot because I haven’t looked  at women in a while! Are… Are you all right Take a better look…she isn’t all that I can’t! Can’t! Can’t! Cant! I so can’t do it! I can’t look her in the face! I’m sorry, Mr Tsukishima… It looks like… This is it for me No! What am I thinking! I can’t give up like this! Mr Tsukishima showed me that  picture because he trusts me! I can’t call myself a man  unless I finish this job! Oh, he’s up Yo! Say your prayers, woman! I, Moe Shishigawara, am  here to take you down! Down where She didn’t get that I didn’t know somebody  like her even existed! Is she really human! Down as in, you know, kill! It means I came to kill you! Like your four-eyed friend! Are you the one who attacked Ishida What’s with this chick…her  demeanors suddenly… Answer me This is good… I can fight with this tension in the air What’s the sense in  answering that question Didn’t you have your answer the  moment I mentioned “four-eyes”! You’re right… Then tell me about your friends You’ve got hot looks, but  you ask stupid questions! You’ll have to force that out of me! Beat the crap out of me first! Okay, that’s enough Mr Tsukishima… The one who attacked Ishida… was me That ain’t right! You kidnap me and brought me here, and now that you’re done  with me, it’s “see ya”! What the hell’s with that! It’s just not right, you know! What’re you getting at Money! Give me fair pay for all the work I did! Pay me, and I’ll keep my  mouth shut about what happened! Right, kid! Huh Weren’t you grabbed and brought here  by this crazy girl just like me! I just don’t get what  kids are into nowadays! I’m curious to see what kind  of parents she was raised by! Anyway! I’m not budging from  here until I get money… Huh W-What! I’m not afraid of you! I’m sorry! I got carried away! Forgive me! I’ll apologize, so don’t  put me back in that plushie! So long as you understand Here! Take this cell phone! What’s this for It’s for me to call you I’ll call if I need you for another job Make sure you arrive within fifteen minutes -What! -Gotta admit…they’re identical -Look young lady, don’t  go messing with adults… Gimme a break! Gimme a break, young lady! Now then! You can go home, too, Ichigo! Huh I can I thought for sure I’d be  staying overnight to train… What! Huh! As if I’d let a gross  creep like you sleep here! Are you stupid! Stupid, stupid, stupid! Look you… She’s right Regardless, letting you  stay would be reckless Fullbring is the power to control  souls with your own flesh and blood It takes a far greater toll  on your body than you think Don’t push yourself too hard Once something goes wrong, your  whole body will shut down I see… No need to rush… We’ll call you as soon as your body heals You lived over a year without your power What’s a few more days, right The one who attacked Ishida… was me Who…are you Shukuro Tsukishima Your… Mr Tsukishima! It wasn’t necessary for you to show up! I’ll take care of this one! There’s no need to put  you through the trouble! C’mon! Come at me, woman! Let me beat you to death! Shishigawara… What! Let’s go home What’re you talking about! As your apprentice, I can’t back away now! I appreciate your looking out for me, but your honor is more  important than my life… Let me ask you something, Shishigawara… Didn’t I say you didn’t  have to do anything Yes, sir… Then… Why are you here That’s because…I wanted to help you… Oh no… Now I lost track of how far I had read… Darn… Hey, Shishigawara… There’s probably more again today… What’re you talking about For a while now, Inoue’s been bringing me leftover  bread from her part-time job… Oh yeah… She has been worrying about you Let her know that you ate them She always leaves too much… Tell you what Huh Stay here a second I’ll bring them Take half home with you Huh Uh…sure… I knew it… I feel bad that she does this everyday Ichigo! What’s got you so freaked Something’s wrong with  Inoue’s Spiritual Pressure! Something’s happening to Inoue! Hey, Shishigawara… Mind taking responsibility But! What just happened! His bookmark turned into a sword! Is that a Zanpakuto! No This is a Fullbring My Fullbring, “Book of the End” Relax I have no intention of  doing anything to you yet For today, I’ll head on home right  after I punish this disobedient boy Oh You’re as kind-hearted  as I had heard you were You can’t bear seeing  even an enemy get hurt That’s not what this is If you’re the one who attacked Ishida, I can’t allow you to get away Ichigo! There’s something else  that concerns me regarding Inoue What, there’s more! What the hell is happening to Inoue! With all that bread left unsold everyday, how do you suppose her workplace  is managing financially! What! This isn’t the time to… Wait, now that you mention it… Shoot… Not enough milk… Shishigawara, mind going out to buy some Yes, sir! I’m back! I bought all sorts of things you might like! Where’s my milk I’ll go get it, so watch this pot, okay Yes, sir! Welcome back! I watched the pot, just like you said! From now on, you don’t have to do anything "
" The one who attacked Ishida… …was me Ichigo! What’s got you so freaked Something’s happening to Inoue! Relax I have no intention of  doing anything to you yet For today, I’ll head on home right  after I punish this disobedient boy Oh You’re as kind-hearted  as I had heard you were You can’t bear seeing  even an enemy get hurt That’s not what this is If you’re the one who attacked Ishida, I can’t allow you to get away I see… Who’re you calling Inoue, who else! Better not That moment when she’s distracted by the ringtone might give the enemy an opening It’s that bad… I don’t know… But her Spiritual Pressure  is under tremendous strain… Is this the right direction Yeah… But I can’t pin down the location with my Spiritual Pressure perception If you’ve got the direction right,  I think I know where she is If we keep going… we’ll reach Inoue’s place! If I’m the one who attacked Ishida, you can’t allow me to get away…eh Such an ordinary line It’s not very interesting It’ll never make it into any book H-Hey! What’s the matter with you Mr Tsukishima is serious! He’s super scary! You won’t get off with just a beating! Please be quiet I’m not doing this for your sake… Sushigawara It’s Shishigawara… I have to focus… No telling what his next move will be He’s already taken out his sword, so maybe I should put up Santenkesshun… But that might look like I’m  provoking him to attack Is there some other way to stop him St…Stop! Santenkesshun! Where’s Inoue’s unit! 403! This way! Inoue! Are you okay, Inoue! Inoue! I’m not cut That can’t be… I definitely felt the blade  cutting deeply into my body Inoue! Kurosaki! Sado! Why are you guys here! Why Chad said something was wrong  with your Spiritual Pressure Are you all right Those fluctuations in your Spiritual  Pressure weren’t normal What exactly happened, Inoue Huh! R-Really! Nothing happened, though I was bent over in pain  because of a stomach ache— maybe that was it That couldn’t be… Wasn’t there another Spiritual  Pressure here until a minute ago Who was that Who My friend I met my friend here and A friend That was Tsukishima After my friend left, my  stomach began to hurt That’s all it was A friend Was Tsukishima my friend Sorry about making you two worry! No He’s the one who attacked Ishida I’ll be sure to tell  you if anything happens! So let me know if anything  happens to either of you, okay S-Sure… I can’t tell Kurosaki Well…we’ll be going, then Okay! See you tomorrow! That was strange… Why did I think he was  my friend for a moment What in me did he cut Hey… What do you think happened to Inoue Yeah… I’m not sure Inoue doesn’t know that Ichigo’s  getting his powers back She doesn’t want to drag Ichigo  into a fight because of her She wants to keep the danger she’s in away from Ichigo more than anyone She said nothing was wrong I guess we have to take her word I agree with her that it’s too risky  to involve Ichigo in a fight  in his present condition I’ll get in touch with Inoue again later I’m sure it must’ve been an error  in my Spiritual Pressure perception Don’t worry about it Okay Another one No Why not You’ve had enough You should be ashamed of yourself What’re you talking about I realize you’re happy that all’s  going well with Ichigo, but… It’s not like that Hey, Riruka! Why don’t you also go home already! Hey! Don’t ignore me, damn it! Oh yeah, it’s empty! Kutsuzawa, give me another! No Why not! What’s one more! No Come on, don’t be like that! No Kugo… It’s your direct line Who is it All right I’ll open it right now Inoue and Chad won’t say anything, but something definitely happened It was probably the same  guy who attacked Ishida Kugo… You think it’s Yeah It was probably Tsukishima’s doing So you do know him! Tsukishima is a Fullbringer, like us And… he was once one of us UNAGIYA Coming! Who is it at this hour That hurt! This door opens toward the stairs! I warned you before to  be careful when opening it! -How many years have you been living here -Ichigo! Where have you been! Taking days off again without telling me! Anyway, come on in! I’ll hear your excuse inside! No, here is fine Why What! You want some time off! Are you crazy! You’ve been taking off this entire time! Just how much work are you  planning on skipping! Are you listening! I’m sorry Well, that’s all I wanted to tell you Wait…just a minute! Ichigo! I don’t know what’s going on with you, but stop worrying about me I’m not one of your classmates! I’m a grown-up! I’m too old to have a kid  like you worrying about me! That’s why, if something  happened, spit it out! It’s okay for kids to rely on adults Thank you, Ms Ikumi Tsukishima  used to be our leader We came together for a shared purpose and worked together to erase our powers Tsukishima discovered a way  to transfer our powers to  a Substitute Soul Reaper He was our leader But… after the Substitute Soul  Reaper we finally found accepted the powers of several  of our group members, Tsukishima suddenly had a change of heart He killed both the Substitute Soul Reaper and the members of our group  who gave him their powers, and disappeared from our ranks Or… perhaps that was his objective all along Let me show you something This was the Substitute Soul  Reaper’s Combat Pass I don’t know what Tsukishima’s  true intentions are He wasn’t the kind of guy  who’d tell you his secrets and he hasn’t shown himself  to us since that day That’s why, right now,  there’s only one thing I  do know about Tsukishima His aim is to prevent us from making contact with you,  a Substitute Soul Reaper His actions support that theory He attacked Uryu Ishida, made contact with Orihime Inoue, and tried to attract your attention using a different, and more  violent, means than we did Ginjo… I… I know what you’re thinking But don’t rush Now that Tsukishima’s  made his next move…  we want to speed things up too We’ll start preparing for your  next training session right away We’ll contact you when we’re ready So for now, go on home tonight Dad… What’s the matter No, it’s nothing… Let’s go someplace else Why Just in case I see Let’s do that I forgot… No… So many things happened all at once that I tried to erase it from my mind… Just how much do you know about  Urahara that makes you  think you understand him Should I chase after him  and ask him right now No…what if Urahara is really my enemy Could I do anything against him now This isn’t good… Ive got to regain my powers  as soon as possible…! Are you all right Yeah… I’m fine, I’m fine Sorry My kitchen came tumbling down… I see… So, it’s true Yes I’m positive I was cut But when I came to, there was no wound, and the people who came here were gone And then, when you and Kurosaki came… for a split second, I thought of that person as a “friend” What do you mean Sorry… I don’t really understand  what I’m saying either I just felt like he was my friend It’s not like I mistook  him for someone else  or that I was mistaken How should I put it… It felt like I thought about the past and… suddenly I remembered who he was Be careful, Sado His abilities seem terribly frightening Yeah… I’ll be careful You said there were two of them together Huh Yes Do you remember their names Yes I think it was Tsukishima… and Sushigawara May I continue, Shishigawara Y-Yes, sir! Listen… As far as this matter is concerned, you don’t need to do anything further But! As your apprentice, I… Will you stop with that apprentice thing Oh! I’m sorry! As your apprentice! I don’t think it’s right to just  watch quietly as you do your work By “this matter,” I meant Orihime Inoue I’ve already placed it inside her No further contact is necessary R-Right Who should I go next Yasutora Sado Or Ichigo Kurosaki I wonder what Ginjo would say if I went after Ichigo Kurosaki directly So Sado, about Sushigawara… Yes, tell me about this Sushigawara guy Sorry… Talking about Sushigawara is making  me want to eat some sushi… Yeah… Me too! Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! If we’re going someplace else, there’s a place that I’m fond of That you’re fond of Yes! With lots of cute ones… You can touch all you want! PLACE FOR GROWNUPS No no no no! I have my beloved Masaki! -I gave her my word that I wouldn’t go -Come on, come on -to hostess bars and places like that! -Let’s go! Welcome! Upsy-daisy! Okay, let’s talk A cat café…"
" That was a restless night… Okay Let’s begin! Hey Riruka He’s all yours! Yeah, yeah… Hey, just a minute What Are you training me in that box again What do you mean, “again”! Besides, it’s been  upgraded for you this time! You see This adorable birdcage will be  your training ground for today! I can’t help but think  that going from a dollhouse to a birdcage is a downgrade… Ginjo! What’s the purpose of  this training, anyway What is it you want me to do You’re right, I haven’t  given you a proper explanation Let me explain then Do you know what the definitive difference is between you and us As Riruka once said, our group is comprised only of people who were able to use Fullbring since birth, or acquired the power without realizing it Unlike us, you must acquire  Fullbring through your own will But… Unlike us, who acquired our powers  naturally, Fullbring for you is obviously not something we  can simply tell you to call up That is why it’s necessary to drive you to physical and mental extremes in order to awaken the power in you It is the only way we can help you ultimately regain your Soul Reaper powers… Do you understand Yeah…guess I have no choice All right, then be a good boy and… But look… What now! More complaints! I don’t have time Training like the last time  isn’t going to cut it If you want to awaken my powers, let me fight one of you! Don’t be ridiculous! You were just barely able  to do Fullbring last time! Know your limits! At your level now, Mr Chicken is plenty! Even allowing you a huge  benefit of the doubt, sending in Mr Pork Mark II is  the best I’m willing to do! Him again What do you mean, “again”! Listen, you’ve only just  become able to do Fullbring, so raising the level won’t… I realize that But that’s how I’ve  gotten stronger until now This time is no different… I don’t get it! I’m warning you, so  why’re you in such a rush Because there are guys I want to protect I can’t stand around doing nothing You look convinced Shush! Can’t stand around doing nothing, eh You might be right Shall we ratchet up the training, then But understand…if you  die, don’t blame us Yeah Hold it Mr Tsukishima What is it, Shishigawara What do you plan on doing next Next You know… About going after Ichigo  Kurosaki or Yasutora Sado… Geez… You distracted me just at the good part I’m…sorry They go to the same school, right Huh What! I’m talking about Orihime  Inoue, who I met last time, Yasutora Sado, and Ichigo Kurosaki Oh, yes, yes they all do Shishigawara I need you to do me a favor Will you do it Kugo, are you serious Yeah, it’s what Ichigo wants I’m not asking about what he wants Huh This guy wants to fight us! I’m against it! I have no intention of helping him What’s gotten into you I’m against it, as well You, too, Giriko I can understand why you want to rush, but the faster we progress with training, the more intense the strain on Mr Kurosaki If we attempt to force the  awakening of his Fullbring, his Fullbring might go out of control I think all of us here except Mr Kurosaki  understand what that means… it means death The out-of-control soul of the object will drive the user’s own  soul out of his physical body I think we should take our time  and do this one step at a time You have to admit, he makes a valid point All that doesn’t matter! Do you remember what Kugo said We want to rid ourselves  of this loathsome power There isn’t a person among us  who uses their power with joy At least I don’t That’s enough, Jackie You want to protect something, you say Noble words, but if you ask me, you’re  nothing but a fool who does things for his ego without considering the danger to his own life It upsets me just to use Fullbring I will not agree to use it  for this naive fool’s sake! Oh well, then… Hey Yukio No thanks But I haven’t said anything yet You’re going to tell me to  bring Jackie back, aren’t you Why not let her do as she wants Kutsuzawa Sooner or later, we’ll  need Jackie’s help I know Give me a moment, please You heard it, Ichigo Sorry, but we’ll have to do  things a step at a time Riruka! Do it! This time, Giriko’s powers take  effect in 10 minutes, so be careful Yeah I permit you! You again, kid Hi Things won’t be so easy like the last time! This is my pal, Bone-Skin It’s not Bone-Skin! That’s it! I’m chickened out! I mean, ticked off! Damn cocky… Uh, hi, I’m Mr Chicken Nice to meet you… You prefer coffee He wants me back Yes You understand that too,  don’t you, Ms Jackie You’re okay with it, Giriko To helping him, you mean No Your powers… Have you heard this story A certain old man had  an old wound on his leg He could predict sudden changes in  the weather by how much it hurt, and as a result, he never  got wet from the rain The point is: when you get to be my age, you learn to live even with  things that once disgusted you Can I become like you, too That…I don’t know… Do you regret it I don’t know… It’s just that I can’t  get myself to like my powers Oh yeah… You did have that technique, kid Be careful, Bone-Skin My name’s not Bone-Skin, you damn pig! I’m positive I was cut But when I came to, there was no wound… And for a split second, I thought of that person as a “friend” If what Inoue said is true,  does that mean the power that the enemy who is after  Ichigo, and us, possesses is the ability to manipulate memories If the person who slashed Ishida and the person who slashed Inoue  are one and the same I’ll try confirming it with Ishida… First Ishida, then Inoue Now I’m next Who’s there! Do I fight No…I can’t afford to  be the next one cut down… Kugo What is it Don’t you feel it This Spiritual Pressure You mean Chad’s Ginjo! What did you just say! Did something happen to Chad! If you don’t pay attention,  you’ll regret it! Why’d you say that You know it’s going to  disrupt his concentration! Shut up Ginjo! I’ll tell you, so calm down! Someone’s Spiritual Pressure  is closing in on Chad! You mean, it’s! Hey, Ginjo! Stop the training! Let me out of here! Can’t… Right now, concentrate on your training! We can’t let you out of there  until this training is done! This is no time to be telling me that! Chad is… Are you telling us that Chad  would be defeated so easily That’s not what I’m saying! Ichigo, what is it that you want to protect Is it the lives of your friends What Are they arguing again Or is it the bond you have with them Seems like it If Chad were weak, I’d rush  over to him this minute But right now, we should  do what we need to do! Isn’t that all there is to it I’m sure that’s what Chad wants, as well Didn’t I tell you He’s training because he  wants to protect something Now, Chad’s in imminent danger,  so he wants to rush to help him It’s all about his wanting  to play the hero of justice What! So you leave here and go to him, what then! You can barely use Fullbring,  you could rush to his side, but you won’t be any help I don’t want anything to do  with a hero wannabe like you! I won’t be of any help, you say Maybe you’re right But I’ve regained some fighting  power, if only a very little If I just stay here without  using my powers to help… It will leave me with nothing but regret! Regret, huh Fine If you want to go, then go I could care less But… If you want to get out  of there, do it yourself If only it were that easy… Is it time Yes “Time Tells No Lies” Damn! Not again! Guess this means I can’t do a  thing unless I defeat these guys Damn! It feel just like Getsugatensho, but  it’s actual power isn’t even close! With such a lame weapon like  that, what’s there to regret Shut up! The sword’s not the same as  the one I always fight with! I get it I was throwing my attacks too soon since this thing  doesn’t have a blade If I charge it more with my Spiritual  Pressure like I did with Getsuga… I’ll give it a try! Hey! Don’t break it! He produced this much  destructive power just by getting a small hang of it Amazing… I’m out! Sorry, gotta go Wait Yeah, I’m okay… I was followed, but I  managed to lose the tail Right now, there’s no indication  that I’m being followed I see…that’s good Anyway, don’t worry about me Continue with your training Yeah, okay Sorry Strange, though… I was followed, but that’s all There was absolutely no sign  that I was about to be attacked What the hell was that Looks like it went well Good work Sir! Okay, let’s keep going! All right, this time you’ll  be entering this fish tank! Got it You’re awfully obedient this time Don’t you have anything to say Like, “You’re making me  get into that thing again!” Nope! Just do it Fine Ichigo I permit you! Welcome Oh, so it’s you Not the plushie this time Now that we know you  don’t need them anymore I believe I haven’t  introduced myself to you yet I’m Jackie Tristan  It’s nice to meet you Ichigo Kurosaki! Let’s get this thing started! Nice I like the look on your face Aren’t you going to attack You haven’t brought out your Fullbring yet So naive… This may be training, but  it’s still a fight You have to consider me your enemy Would you say the same  thing on a battlefield I probably would Unbelievable Fine then I’ll start “Dirty Boots”! You ruined my birdcage! I’ll pay for it later,  isn’t that good enough No! That was my favorite! Then what should I do Oh, fine… I’ll forgive you if you go eat  donuts with me just this once! Donuts Wait, uh, donuts! Okay, I’ll be going now Go ahead We don’t need you anymore Hey young lady! Mind if I take one of these plushies with me You’re into girlie things like that Oh come on! You can have one! Now get out of here! You give me the creeps! Thanks, young lady! Look, I brought Mr Pork! Mr Pork’s occupation: Mr Pork’s occupation:  Nursery school teacher "
" Damn! Not again! Damn! It feels just like Getsugatensho, but its actual power isn’t even close! I get it…  I was throwing my attacks too soon since this thing doesn’t have a blade If I charge it more with my Spiritual Pressure like I did with Getsuga I’ll give it a try! He produced this much destructive power just by getting a small hang of it Amazing All right, this time you’ll  be entering this fish tank! I permit you! Welcome Oh, so it’s you Not the plushie this time Now that we know you  don’t need them anymore I believe I haven’t introduced  myself to you yet I’m Jackie Tristan  It’s nice to meet you Ichigo Kurosaki! Let’s get this thing started! Nice I like the look on your face “Dirty Boots”! Wow Not bad I didn’t think you could dodge that I didn’t either What’s that supposed to mean What about you What’s with that outfit I didn’t know there was a  Fullbring you could wear There are That’s why I’m dressed like this I see So, this “Dirty Boots” of yours What’s its ability You think I’d tell you Good point This is a battle, after all Guess I’ll have to find out for myself Right! Hey, where’re you going We need you to undo your “Dollhouse”  when they’re done Stay here and watch No! Huh Can I say something  that’s been on my mind No need to say it I don’t like that aspect of Riruka I said you didn’t have to say it What about you, Giriko Me I don’t really mind I don’t want to look  at Jackie’s Fullbring! Not over yet! Hmm… How is Mr Kurosaki doing Hard to say… One… Two… Three! I see… Aren’t you going to attack Then… let me attack you! You’ve been repeating the same routine Dodging my attacks, then getting hit You’ve got good instincts,  but you sure take your time Are you trying to get the  hang of it as you fight Not that it matters Pretty soon you won’t  have that luxury See this The soil that was hard before is soaking up water and turning into mud Observe My “Dirty Boots” are getting dirty It’s begun Yeah… Do you think Mr Kurosaki will survive We can only hope Her kick got stronger Get it now As the name “Dirty Boots” implies, the dirtier they get, the stronger I become With sand, dirt, mud,  dust…blood, rust, anything! I was slowly gaining strength until now But from here on, they’ll become stronger  at an accelerated rate! The dirtier they get, the  stronger she becomes What’s with that! That’s so stupid! I can’t stand getting dirty! I’ll never become dirty I’ll always be clean and cute Even when I die Then can you buy me that next time! Sure, I’ll buy you anything Yay! Ichigo Kurosaki… Stop messing around!! Don’t you understand! You’re not a Soul Reaper right now! You’re fighting with a mortal body! Did you lose your sense of reality from fighting so long as a Spiritual Entity! You’re mortal! You can die! If you continue taking  any more of my attacks with your mortal body, you’ll  be dead meat in no time! Is that all you know how to do! That technique of yours is full of holes! It’s useless in real combat! Haven’t you realized that yet! If you haven’t, I’ll show you! That technique is inconsistent  in its effectiveness! Depending on your concentration, the number of blades varies  from three to six! You keep firing it and the  number of blades will decrease At four blades or less, I  can destroy it with a kick! And! After three consecutive shots… “I become most vulnerable”…is that it He did that intentionally! He’s gone Bringer Light!  The flickering of the Bringer Light after moving at high speed  using Fullbring is an  indication for the user’s  next high-speed jump…  It’s a sign that he’s  beginning to master Fullbring Impressive  You quickly grasped the flaw  of your newly acquired ability and took advantage of it Who taught you how to fight I was taught the basics The rest… I learned as I fought I was a Soul Reaper for only a short period But in terms of experience,  I got more than you guys Experience, eh His mind for battle, which had  been unconsciously sharpened  in the battles he’s fought, is being awakened as he fights  in a state without his powers  Not bad, Ichigo Kurosaki  Ready Bring it! Hey… Thank you, Mr Chad Sure… Where’s Ichigo Over there I see… That’s perfect Huh I wanted to ask you something That guy you told me about This Tsukishima I want to know about his ability I see… Orihime Inoue said that, huh I’m positive I was cut  But when I came to, there was no wound…  and the people who came here were gone…  And then, when you and Kurosaki came…  for a split second, I thought of  that person as a “friend”  I don’t really understand  what I’m saying either  I just felt like he was my friend  It’s not like I mistook  him for someone else  or that I was mistaken How should I put it…  It felt like I thought about the past and…  suddenly I remembered who he was  I’m thinking that’s what  Tsukishima’s ability is Ability That’s right… The power of suggestion—interfering with memories Did Tsukishima’s Fullbring have  that sort of special ability Tell me… Don’t keep anything from me now That’s good At this pace… Ichigo! What the! My Combat Pass… Don’t hide it I’m not hiding anything I’m puzzled… Puzzled If Tsukishima possessed  such an ability, I would’ve definitely told you at the beginning Tsukishima’s Fullbring is  called “Book of the End” An extremely deadly weapon—literally, a sword that can cut anything But… That sword possesses no special abilities Don’t just stand there… Let’s continue! We’re stopping What’re you talking about! We’re not done! Your Fullbring is going out of control! I’ve never seen that happen before! We pushed the pace of  your training too hard! We have to stop It’s all right! Let’s keep going! Riruka! Undo “Dollhouse” I said, let’s keep going! My Fullbring isn’t out of control! This is how I’ve always done it… This is my Combat Pass telling me to hurry up and regain my powers! Listen… I’m telling you it’s dangerous! Do you need to be crushed to understand! Is it possible that his ability changed That couldn’t be Fullbring powers dont change with growth But my ability has gone  through a lot of changes! No, you’re mistaken In your case, you just  weren’t able to find your Fullbring’s innate ability  in the early stages How many years do you think we’ve  lived with our Fullbring We’re way past that stage Then what happened to Inoue That’s why I said I’m puzzled As far as I know, that wasn’t the  work of Tsukishima’s ability What about Uryu Ishida Huh He was attacked by Tsukishima, wasn’t he Is Uryu Ishida’s memory in disarray Fine… Great, look how dirty they’ve become… I’ll crush you as you wish! Good! We need to make sure… If Uryu Ishida’s memory is also affected, that’s something else  we have to worry about… If his memories haven’t been affected… Then what It means it wasn’t Tsukishima  who stabbed Orihime Inoue Are you sure Hi It’s been a long time, Ginjo …Tsukishima! So he’s… How’ve you all been Kutsuzawa, hope you haven’t  been drinking too much Yukio… Looks like you’re still  engrossed with playing games That’s not good You need to read more books Riruka’s not here Tsukishima…what did you come here for I don’t see Jackie around, either Tsukishima! They in there Wait, Tsukishima! What is this! Ichigo Hmm… That you, Riruka! Listen,  Tsukishima just… Hey! I bought too much stuff to carry back  Can you come pick me up in your car   I don’t have a car! Forget  that, Tsukishima just… What! God, you’re so useless!  You’re the one who’s useless! Xcution Dictionary! Today, I’ll explain Jackie’s power! Jackie’s Fullbring is “Dirty Boots” The dirtier her boots get, the  stronger Jackie’s kicks become! If that’s the case, wouldn’t  it be better to keep them dirty Look, that’s not how it goes… What if we gave them that distressed look… Knock it off! Huh! Now look what you’ve done! Hey, stop that! You’re making a hole in the floor! "
" I see… Orihime Inoue said that, huh I’m thinking that’s what  Tsukishima’s ability is The power of suggestion—interfering  with memories… Did Tsukishima’s Fullbring have  that sort of special ability Tell me… Don’t keep anything from me now That’s good At this pace… Ichigo! What the! My Combat Pass… What about Uryu Ishida He was attacked by Tsukishima, wasn’t he Is Uryu Ishida’s memory in disarray If Uryu Ishida’s memory is also affected, that’s something else  we have to worry about… If his memories haven’t been affected… Then what It means it wasn’t Tsukishima  who stabbed Orihime Inoue Are you sure Hi It’s been a long time, Ginjo Tsukishima! So he’s… How’ve you all been Kutsuzawa, hope you haven’t  been drinking too much Yukio… Looks like you’re still  engrossed with playing games That’s not good You need to read more books Riruka’s not here Tsukishima…what did you come here for I don’t see Jackie around, either Tsukishima! They in there Wait, Tsukishima! What is this! Ichigo Ichigo… Ichigo… That’s… A Shihakusho! Could it be…his Soul Reaper  powers have returned No… That’s not a Shihakusho It’s… a Clad-Type Fullbring! Is this the true form  of Ichigo’s Fullbring! Of course! It was the same with Ichigo’s Bankai Not only his sword, but his  Shihakusho changed as well… He said his Shihakusho was  a part of his Bankai It was a Bankai that was worn For Ichigo… wearing his power is his true form Did you know When Riruka’s “Dollhouse” is broken,  whatever’s inside is forcibly set free So you were hiding and  training in that thing… But I must say, you’ve come quite far If that was the case… You could have told me Hmm… Who are you What do you want with me Oh This is a surprise You mean you haven’t heard about me yet Oh no… I hadn’t told Ichigo  yet about Tsukishima…! I’m Shukuro Tsukishima… Your friend’s… Chad, wait! Idiot Do something like that in here and… What was that! Was that an explosion! From where! Did a gas leak cause an explosion! Call the police! Hurry, hurry! What was that noise! See You get fools going crazy What a pain I’ll handle the neighbors, the  fire department and the police… Oh boy… Who do you think has to pay  to fix all of this damage Hey! What was that noise about! Hey, tell me! Chad! He’s not here… Ginjo! He’s not here… Somebody explain! You idiot! Don’t make things worse  than they already are… Ichigo’s activated his Fullbring I say it’s time we tell  him about Tsukishima now Not yet… We still don’t know how powerful  Ichigo’s Fullbring is And, we don’t know if he has  full control of it yet… Right now, telling him  that Tsukishima attacked Inoue would only agitate him I see… So he’s the one… Ichigo! I didn’t realize… You guys were so concerned about me… Looks that way Were you the one who attacked Inoue… and the one who cut down Ishida What do you think Hmm… Is this your Fullbring You’re strong, I’ll grant you that Damn it! What’s going on! None of Ichigo’s attacks are hitting him! Even though Ichigo’s first  step and timing are perfect Take a look at Tsukishima’s feet Bringer Light! At the moment when Ichigo’s  attacks are about to reach him, Tsukishima uses his Fullbring  to make a high-speed move just out of harm’s way Ichigo! Wait! What’s that… You’ll never be able to  hit me with such attacks I said, it’ll never hit Is that… Wow! Ichigo! When did he learn to do Bringer Light Nice! He used Fullbring on the concrete  floor to leap farther But…that’s still not enough… Did he just It was slight, but during his jump he  applied Fullbring to the air to accelerate himself Ichigo… You’ve already mastered  Fullbring to that extent I see… Looks like you’re more  capable than I had thought But… It’s not good enough Your Fullbring power itself is still… Far from being complete If you concentrate on your right arm, the Fullbring on your left arm  becomes undone all too easily Case in point, you were unable to break  your fall just now…right Damn… Sorry… Looks like it’s still a bit too  early to let Ichigo fight you Ginjo… I’m back! Man, that was crazy! You won’t believe this! I guess they said on TV that  honey was good for you, and now it’s being sold out everywhere! So I rode my bicycle to the next, next town and went to fifteen different stores and… Huh Mr Tsukishima Are you in the bathroom Are you taking a dump Are you going to interfere, Ginjo I guess we see things differently If you ask me, you’re the  one who’s interfering Ginjo… Move! Can’t do I said… Get out of the way! Don’t you get it I’m saying you’re in the way You don’t get slammed from  that height and come away unscathed with a mortal body Right now, you’re struggling  just to breathe We can’t afford to have you die Now shut up and go to sleep Ginjo… Are you serious about this If you fight me, you’ll die, Ginjo We really don’t see things  the same way, do we If we cross swords, aren’t you  the one who’s going to die Wait, Ginjo I can still… Chad! Don’t, Ichigo… I know you realize the  difference in power… In your condition, it’d  be impossible to beat him! What you’re seeing is a fight  between two Fullbringers So you want me to simply  stand by and watch! You want me to let the guy who  attacked Inoue and Ishida go! I’m not saying that! I’m saying it’s still  too early to fight him! Something’s wrong… His sharp attacks clearly shows that  he’s aiming for my vital spots… And yet… I don’t feel any blood thirst from him Ginjo… What’s he planning to do Damn you… Now look what they did… They’re fools! Fools! Now it’s coming from that way! Oh, my! Wow, awesome! A fire What is going on! The crowd is growing This is not good Ginjo! Don’t! Let go of me! Ichigo! That was dangerous You cut pretty deep into the building What if there were people inside Don’t worry I made sure to choose an abandoned  building when I jumped over Is that so In that case, I’ll also let loose Not over yet! Ichigo changed his fighting style Did he learn to manipulate his Fullbring  just by watching Ginjo fight Ichigo… Looks like you’ve gotten a bit better But…that sort of attack  still won’t affect me You really don’t get it, do you Your Fullbring is still incomplete Ichigo! Such a big difference from a second ago Not bad… Your power is now… much closer to the power you once possessed “Invaders Must Die” What…is this! I see… You don’t want me to come in contact with Ichigo Kurosaki when his  powers are still incomplete Especially when he’s so close  to perfecting it Right Yukio I feel like we’re forgetting something… Aside from the fact that Ginjo and Chad owe me an explanation, what else is there! No, it’s not about your stupid  issue, but something else… The story is moving forward without  anyone coming to help me… I’m sorry… I was cooking, when all of a sudden… That wouldn’t cause an  explosion this big, would it What’s taking you The commotion isn’t dying down at all… Huh It’s already been two years  since I became a single father… I’m not used to cooking, so  it’s been a real struggle… Huh What are you I never imagined cooking my daughter’s favorite, omelet, would cause all this What omelet… Please forgive your Dad What a wonderful father-daughter love!  Looks like he’s doing a great job…"
" Not bad… Your power is now… much closer to power you once possessed “Invaders Must Die” What…is this! I see… You don’t want me to come in contact with Ichigo Kurosaki when his  powers are still incomplete Especially when he’s so close  to perfecting it Right Yukio Hey…What is this! What’s going on! Let me out of here! Hey! No you don’t! Save complete… Now… Ichigo Kurosaki, who’s close  to being fully developed, won’t have to come in contact with me But maybe you made a mistake Shouldn’t you have confined  me in there, instead Sorry… I didn’t have enough  battery life to save you Plus, that wasn’t why I saved Kurosaki Listen You hear that You see We’ve attracted a crowd, the  police and the fire department… We’ve caused violent explosions… TV news choppers might  even come flying by… Wouldn’t that be a problem for  you, as well, Mr Tsukishima “The Love Gun” That’s right! You know what it can do! You made it! Mind making yourself scarce I’m not really good at these types of things Get going, Mr Tsukishima… But if you want to make  a spectacle of yourself, then I suggest you stay here All right See you again, Riruka We should go, as well We’ll take Ichigo and Jackie with us… Chad! What’s wrong! Hey! Come in Ishida… Sorry to call you here  on such short notice… Thank you for coming No…don’t mention it How’re you feeling A lot better That’s good… So, what’s the matter About that… I want you to heal these wounds right now Huh… Sure, no problem, but… Why all of a sudden The situation’s changed Kurosakii…made contact with  the guy who did this to me His Spiritual Pressure is  different than it was before, but it was definitely Kurosaki’s… I don’t know why his  Spiritual Pressure changed, but what’s certain is that I can’t  bide my time recovering in bed You’ve sensed that something’s  different, too, haven’t you Yes, I did, but… But Kurosaki hasn’t said  anything to me yet, so I’ve kept my distance… But… If the presence I sensed  together with Kurosaki is the person who attacked you… Then… I think he’s the same  person who attacked me What All right, load complete Where are we! Our alternate hideout It’s far from comfortable, though What If you say things like that,  I’m not adding any amenities It’s not your money, but all you  do is complain for gosh sake… It’s my money that’s going to end up paying to fix previous hideout… Sorry… But you caused a lot of explosions… Do I spend money to fix it up the way it was, or rebuild from scratch I’d better calculate which is cheaper Take that up with Chad… When he wakes up, I will Chad! Why do I have to be the  one who looks after him! Really… Both Chad and Jackie’s injury are nothing! Don’t get theatrical and  faint on us like that! If I leave them alone, they’ll  wake right up, won’t they For crying out loud… Chad! Are you okay, Chad Chad Uh, yeah… I’m okay… It’s not serious… Good… What about that guy, Tsukishima He retreated… For now, anyway Something bothering you No… If he wanted to hurt us, he could’ve still kept  fighting in that situation… Especially with his power Riruka was inside of  Tsukishima’s attack radius, and he could’ve cut down Yukio, as well Was the reason he didn’t attack them because he was actually  only interested in you… Or… Did he have some other reason You’re overthinking it Mr Tsukishima knows my abilities He couldn’t attack me  under those conditions while I had the terminal in my hand Even more so if he’s  interested in Kurosaki I suppose you’re right Kutsuzawa, how’s your end No problems at all The police, fire department,  reporters and neighbors— they’ve all been taken care of Good work Okay then, I’ll start  working on an estimate… Man, what a headache this is going to be… Wait, Yukio Stay here and work with  Ichigo on his training What! Why me! There’s nothing I can do for him! Besides, this thing’s  about to lose its charge! There is, that’s why I’m asking Do it with the cord plugged in! I’m exhausted after what just  happened, so I don’t want to! So the truth comes out I don’t know how Tsukishima found our hideout, but  it’d be reasonable to assume he traced the Spiritual Pressure If that’s so, then your Fullbring, which can completely block  off Spiritual Pressure, will be essential to Ichigo’s training You can do it, right All right Training…as in an actual fighting That’s right It seems that suits you best, after all Just so you know, I’ve  already defeated Jackie Who will I be fighting next Me Strange… You and I were attacked by the same person, but the extent of your  injuries versus mine… suggests an enemy with  different capabilities One other thing… Did you notice a sweet smell A sweet smell What was it now… Honey, maybe… I remembered something! He called his Zanpakuto-like  power “Fullbring”! Was it the same for the person  who attacked you, as well Sorry… I didn’t have the luxury  to ask questions… Until you mentioned it, I thought that that sword  was a type of Zanpakuto… Sado Inoue… If you’re taking this street… Were you at the hospital Yes, I was there, healing  Ishida’s injuries I see… How did it go His wounds have healed, but I think he should stay  in bed a bit longer They don’t seem to be injuries caused by ordinary Spiritual Pressure… I see… I’m glad I met you here I wanted to ask you how Ishida was doing Tell me as we walk back Huh W-Wait, Sado! Where are we going To where Ichigo is From here on, Ichigo’s training  will require your powers! Okay, I’ll begin now I see… So this is what I was being kept in earlier That’s right This is Yukio’s Fullbring,  “Invaders Must Die” He can trap a target in another dimension and “control” it on a game screen Don’t worry I’ve told him not to interfere Ever fantasize about being inside a game What’re you talking about Admit it Every kid’s thought about it Nothing to be embarrassed about I can’t say I never  thought about it, but… Is that so I’ve never wanted to, not even once Then why’d you make me say it Well, whether you did or not  doesn’t make any difference So why’d you make me say it! This might be a bit different  than you imagined… I wanted to tell you that this is what  the inside of a game looks like It’s definitely a lot more  barren than I thought it’d be Barren In that case… How’s this Isn’t it a lot livelier  It’s awfully one-dimensional, though… Yukio, you don’t have to  do anything unnecessary Anyway, though, since you’ve  entered this game space, don’t you want rules fitting for a game What do you mean Nothing too complicated A simple “system” Yukio! Can you give us a life gauge Okay Matched to your current health  No Make it an even six each Okay Oh, there we go When those six life gauges are gone So it’s “game over”… Exactly Do you need an explanation  of “game over” No thanks I can guess When it’s “game over,”  I’ll put up a “You Die” Very funny Ready Yeah “Cross of Scaffold” Just a minute! Who’s that girl! This is Inoue Oh She’s the one! Hello… This is Riruka Dokugamine Pleased to meet you… Chad’s told me about you He says you can heal people’s injuries What’d you come here for Are you here to help with  Ichigo’s training Come on, Riruka… That’s right Do you realize what you’ll be doing Healing his injuries means he’s  going to get injured again later! If you heal him, Ichigo will get  injured and suffer over and over You’re… worried for Kurosaki, too, aren’t you Huh Uh… No, I… I’m not! Now just a minute! I realize that But… I got past that issue a long time ago If Kurosaki needs my help to  do what he’s decided to do, regardless of what it is, I will use my powers to help him What if Ichigo suffers a terrible  injury he can’t recover from I won’t ever let him suffer an injury he can’t recover from No matter how hopeless the injury, I will heal it completely He wields that huge sword as  though it weighs nothing…  Coming at you! You’ve gotten quite a bit  better at wielding Fullbring But … You still have a long way to go Oh… Welcome Ginjo A visitor I’m letting her in Oh, if it isn’t the healing item Uh… How do you do I’m…uh… Skip the greetings You’re just in time for a job Hurry up and heal him Kurosaki! Come on… This is so stupid So that’s the last of it, right Are you sure about this… Absolutely sure Get off my back! How many times do you need to make sure A father may rob his son’s future It’s only right to confirm multiple  times that you’re certain about this And I’m saying to stop  asking me again and again I guess you’re right All right, let’s move on to our last step Just place your Spiritual Pressure  in here and it’s done Okay, please do it Right Our next episode will  be a New Years special Wow, looks like it’s going to  be an all-star of Soul Reapers Who knows I can pretty much tell from  what we’re seeing You don’t really believe what’s being  shown is going to be everything, are you What! It’s not! That, is a secret It is! Xcution Dictionary! W-What is this! An extra level Isn’t it fun Oh, that’s a poisonous swamp Tell me that sooner! Inoue! I’m sorry, I’m at level 40 right now, so to join me, you’ll need to go to the castle,  get the secret treasure, and defeat the monster in the hills  and reach level 35 first, okay Huh You can’t use the healing item  until you get to a higher level What a hassle!

Why’re you turning it down Huh Having the Squads overcome their differences to get along  is a wonderful thing! Yes, it is, but Hisagi is entrusting you with this important task because he trusts you, Kira! NoI don’t think that’s why he You can do it, Kira! Y-You think so I do! Hinamori! Be right there! Well, I’ll be looking  forward to your article! All right…I’ll do my best! So today, you’ll all be flying kites Have fun Okay, ready… This is a lovely New Year’s sight Hinamori said she’d be coming later… I hope I can make this all  exciting before she arrives Say, Captain… The others’ kites are flying high, but… Our kite isn’t doing as well That’s because you made  ours look like this! That’s why I told you to  do a more ordinary design! Huh Whose kite is that What’re you doing, Hisagi Can’t you tell What, is there a problem Uh…we’re the hosts here… The purpose of this event is to  have all Squads get along, right So what’s the issue All right… Please help make sure everyone has a good time flying their kites, okay I heard you! Whoa! It’s really getting up there Huh Hisagi, you bastard! Oh, sorry I’ll untangle it right now Our string snapped! You did that on purpose! Don’t be silly… Maybe your string was weak What! Squad 11’s weak! Is that what you’re trying to say! Hey, please calm down! He’s insulted Squad 11’s pride— I won’t stand for it either It was just a kite! Hey Hisagi! Let’s see whose kite—yours  or mine—flies higher! You’re on Oh, yeah! Okay, let’s do this, Yumichika! Right! Now hold on, both of you! Hisagi! Why’d you have to start an  argument from your side! Huh It’s theatrics to kick things  up a notch Theatrics! There, you see! Kotsubaki! Our Captain will always  be number one, right! You bet! Now leave this to me! What! It’s a hassle, but since  Captain Soi Fon might scold me, I’d better take first place What! See I’ve really kicked  things up, haven’t I This can’t be happening… Look out! Out of my way! I’ll give it my best, too! That hurt… Looks like you’re having a hard time… Captain Kyoraku… We’re enjoying ourselves The two of you…aren’t competing We’re different from those barbarians I’m relieved to hear that Look, look, look! Collision coming! Collision coming! Hey! What’re doing to our kite! For starters, I’ll go after the  easy-to-knock-down women’s kite! Omaeda! That’s a cheap shot! Who cares It’s you women’s fault for being weak! Hado Number 31! Shakkaho! My kite! Women are weak, and easy  to knockdown, you say I will not tolerate… such insults! Way to go! Do it! Do it! Shakkaho! Yes! Success! Don’t underestimate Squad 13! I figured this might happen, so I put together a kite using  new materials made in America! Good job, Kotsubaki! Wait a second… What sort of situation would prompt  you to make a kite like that What’s that! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! This is our Squad 11 captain’s kite! Things are becoming quite heated… No you don’t, Madarame! Your kite is no match for mine! You can’t beat our “True  Lady Yoruichi” kite! Nooooo! It’s no use This is out of my control… That voice…Hinamori! Help! What’s going on! Get me down! Hinamori! What is she doing up there! Allow me to explain! Hinamori, who arrived late to the grounds, became a victim of the kite battle between the Punishment Force and Squad 11… Unfortunately for her, the rope she grabbed was  pulled skyward by the kite and that’s how she ended up, up, there! This is no time to be explaining! We’ve got to do something  and help Hinamori down… Bankai! Huh! Daiguren Hyorinmaru! If that’s the way they want to play, we’ll take down Ikkaku’s kite together! Hado Number 58! Tenran! I’ll save you, Hinamori! Shiro! Shiro! Hinamori! Captain! Hinamori! What was that wind Hey! Don’t get distracted! What’s that! Go, go, Baldy! Go, go, Meow-Meow! Do your best, both of you! Why… Why won’t anyone listen to me… Keep your chin up, Izuru! Hisagi… Use this, Izuru! Use this to complete your mission! T-This is…! It’s about time we settle  this once and for all… Yeah! I’ll send your kite crashing  down with the next hit! Pull! Go! I will stop you both myself! Raise your head! Wabisuke! Huh Isn’t that… I hope not… You fool! It’s the start of the New Year—what  is the meaning of this! Extra, extra! SEIREITEI BULLETIN GIANT KITE CRASHES INTO SQUAD 1 BARRACKS Read all about it! Extra! I’m such a loser… Sorry to make you wait, Renji That’s okay Sit down So, what did you want to  see me about today, Rukia Have a drink first! This is sake from the World of the Living! Come on, just one drink Renji! The reason I asked you here is… I’ve been asked to perform a dance So, youre having trouble  getting the steps right, and that’s why you wanted to talk to me Yes… I’ve learned the choreography… But… The Celebration Dance is  something Hisana once did Keep that in mind so as not to  embarrass the Kuchiki Clan I’ve been told that my sister  danced it beautifully… I could never match her Oh, yeah I see, but I’m not sure  I’m the one to talk to… Oh yeah! Hey, show me this dance of yours You want to see me dance! I can’t tell whether you’re  good or bad without seeing it I suppose you’re right, but… Well That was a strange-looking dance… What! How dare you call it “strange-looking” after coming just to see it! Getting angry isn’t going to help! Didn’t you think it was  strange-looking yourself Well, yes, but… Be that as it may, this is one  expensive-looking kimono… It sure is! This piece was painstakingly made over a long period of  time just for this dance! As long as you can get the dance right, there’s no need for you to wear… Huh Rukia, what’s this Oh, that’s a book on dance for beginners What about it I’ve got it! Rukia, come with me! No, I have to rehearse my dance… Never mind, let’s go! H-Hey! Wait, Renji! Don’t worry! This won’t take long! We’ve come with a request! Hey, what’re we doing at Squad 11 You’ll see—I want to get stronger! Quit slacking, damn it! Listen up, you guys! Fighting has no holidays! If you slack, I’ll kill you personally  and toss you into the river! And what do you guys want Let’s join them, Rukia! Why me, too! I see… This’ll be fun! Hello! What are you planning to do at Squad 10! Never mind Just indulge me My, what brings the two of you here The Captain’s not here right now… If I do say, Rangiku You look especially ravishing today! Huh What’re you talking about Did you come all this way  to sexually harass me Of course not! Rukia here wants to learn the  secret of your feminine charms! Right, Rukia Huh! Oh Not…really… Oh, I see… So you’ve finally awakened  to your own femininity! I said… Come in, come in! Hey, wait! After all the trouble I went through… I don’t have time for your games! How was that Okay, I guess Don’t comment when you  weren’t even watching! What is that you’re doing today, anyway! Can’t you tell I’m practicing my New  Year’s calligraphy Do that at your own place! Why not give it a try Huh Doing calligraphy and calming your mind might help you immerse yourself  even further in your dance! Is that how it works It can’t hurt to try! Okay, done! Well Doesn’t your mind feel calmer It does… By the way… What time is it About seven, maybe Seven! Is it that late already! Calm down, Rukia! Don’t get so flustered! Quiet! Because of you, I’ve wasted more time! That’s not fair! Then what about all I’ve done… Forget it! Go home But…I was trying to… I said, go home Hey, hear me out! Ouch… Are you all right, Rukia Yes… I’m fine… The kimono… Oh no… I’m…so sorry, Rukia! About the kimono, I’ll This piece was painstakingly made  over a long period of  time just for this dance! Get out… Rukia Get out! Master Byakuya What is it It’s about… Where am I Long time no see, Kuchiki Sir Kaien! I came today to check on you Sir Kaien, I… No, don’t say a word Listen, right now you’re… THE BOY AT THE TEMPLE GATE —A CANDLE IN THE WIND “The boy at the temple gate—a  candle in the wind”! Huh You know the proverbs: “A cornered rat cannot repent” “Nothing ventured is  worth two in the bush” “Out of sight…fall from trees” Uh…yeah… But, Kuchiki! Fear is greater with or without consent In one ear and a nail in the other Even a worm has a god who will save it Don’t ever forget that! Please don’t go, Sir Kaien! What should I do! When your toes are tired, put  a chili pepper in your socks! So long! Sir Kaien! Sir Kaien! A dream What a strange dream… Brother! Hisana wore that kimono when she performed at the Celebration Dance You should wear it, as well, when you dance at this year’s ceremony Brother! However, what’s important  is not the kimono, but your attitude towards  performing the dance You know what I’m talking about… There was someone else who said  the same thing before I did… Let’s join them, Rukia! You look especially ravishing today! Doing calligraphy and calming your mind… That Renji… So that’s why he went about  doing all those things Rukia, there’s still time before  the Celebration Ceremony Use that time to practice your dance and not embarrass the Kuchiki Clan Thank you very much, Brother! Hello! Oh, if it isn’t Hanataro… It’s been a long time I came today to see Lieutenant Abarai… Oh, Renji Is something the matter No, just that Renji… has shut himself up in his  room since yesterday I understand Then… TO RENJI ABARAI please see that he gets this All right I’ll be sure he gets it Well then, I’ll be going How unusual for Renji to get a letter… I wonder who it’s from RUKIA KUCHIKI Dear Renji, This coming January 10th, I will be performing the Celebration Dance I’d really like you to come and see me Thank you Rukia! Your dance has greatly improved! Really! My feet were warm,  making it easier to perform Thanks to my advice, no less! I kept a chili pepper in my socks! Sir Kaien was right all along! What about my advice Thank you so much, Sir Kaien! Another Illustrated Guide for the year! Ichigo! Let’s have a kite-flying contest! Keigo That kite’s humongous! Ichigo! Let’s give it our best! What the hell! Ishida! Why so glum The Quincy Dance recital is coming up… It’s not going well… Q-Quincy dance Let’s do it! You’re on! My recital… Huh! W-What…! "
" So that’s the last of it, right Are you sure about this Absolutely sure Get off my back! How many times do you need to make sure A father may rob his son’s future It’s only right to confirm multiple  times that you’re certain about this And I’m saying to stop  asking me again and again I guess you’re right All right, let’s move on to our last step Just place your Spiritual Pressure  in here and it’s done Okay, please do it Right He wields that huge sword  as though it weighs nothing Coming at you! You’ve gotten quite a bit  better at wielding Fullbring But… You still have a long way to go Kugo A visitor I’m letting her in Oh, if it isn’t the healing item Uh… How do you do I’m…uh… Skip the greetings You’re just in time for a job Hurry up and heal him Kurosaki! I-Inoue I see… Chad brought you here, didn’t he Kurosaki… That’s right I know you didnt want Inoue to get involved, but you’ll need her help from here on Hey, Chad… I know I didn’t come here to assist Ichigo I had Yukio make a separate  room with a higher setting I’ll be training there by myself If we’re going to fight Tsukishima, then I can’t be standing  around doing nothing All right… Do as you wish I will We’re outta here, Mr Tsukishima And we’re taking Kurosaki with us But if you want to make  a spectacle of yourself, then I suggest you stay here Damn it… Chad! Whats wrong! Hey! I was cut for sure… Yet no one seemed to notice  that I had been cut Theres no wound…no pain either Even Im tempted to question  if Ive really been cut Inoue was right His ability is inexplicable I dont know what he did to me,  but the only way to take him  on is to become stronger I must get stronger…as fast as I can… What’s taking so long Isnt he healed yet Please wait just a bit longer I cant wait You’re good, right, Ichigo Yeah Wait, Kurosaki! No, Inoue! Look out! A Santenkesshun You’re going to block my “Cross  of Scaffold” with that thing! Youre wrong How so! Shitenkoshun It diffuses the impact of an attack by exploding the moment it’s hit And at the same time, it automatically responds with  a reactive attack of its own A detonation shield, eh Now that’s nasty Call it what you want If you dont want to get hurt, then dont attack when I tell you not to Inoue… When did you Its been seventeen months  since you lost your powers Its not as though Sado and I  did nothing during that time We had faith That one day, you’d regain your power to fight So both me and Sado… made a decision That when that time comes… we won’t be a burden to you Dont worry about us We want you to focus on  getting your powers back I see… Thanks, Inoue All right! Lets keep going, Ginjo! Yeah He figured that my reach  makes in-fighting difficult, so he changed tactics by moving in closer… Guess again! Why do you think this has  a hilt on the blade! Its to compensate for the  disadvantage of my reach! Is that right Still… hes fighting with much more  efficiency than earlier Which means I was right to bring her here He’s at his best… when somebody he has to protect is near him But still… Riruka… How come youre crouching over there Umm… There was nothing to lean on, so… Yukio! Make a table and a chair! Im going to have my snack here Hurry it up! Huh! He can do that! No way What! Can you do that for me too Please! Sure What the hell, Yukio! Riruka, you should learn  to ask nicely like her Now’s a good time Why  not have her teach you Just wait till I get out of here… Huh Whatre you looking at You can look, but you can’t have any Its so good! That’s right! Be thankful  and don’t eat it too fast Uh-huh! Hey! You ate it already! You only get one! Oh, fine! Eat it Just eat it! My god! How audacious are you! Now I want to know what  your parents are like! You’re right Id like to as well What You don’t have parents Nope I heard they were really abusive My brother thought they  were going to kill me, so he ran away with me when I was a baby Oh So your brother who’s raising  you now is your parent Well, Id like to see his face! Sorry He’s already dead A distant aunt is paying for  my living expenses right now If my grades drop, so do my funds But thanks to her, I make sure  to study, so I’m kind of glad Im leaving! You’re boring me with your stories! Huh! How can you talk about something like that with  a smile on your face! There must be something wrong with you! No… Because Ive already been saved Im able to laugh and talk like this… all thanks to Kurosaki Are you stupid! Thats not what I was asking! And besides, I wasnt listening to  what you were saying earlier either! Im sorry… See you! Wait! Are you really going! Look, therere still some donuts left No thanks! I was tired of eating them anyway! If you want them, help yourself! Thank you! You really are a nice person, Riruka! You’re such an idiot… Strange… I dont feel anything from his sword I thought it was because  I wasnt used to fighting him  at first, but that’s not it… I don’t feel anything  no matter how many times I strike him And it’s also different from what  I felt against Gin Ichimaru… In his case, his mind  wasn’t focused towards me But this guy’s different Hes looking straight at me, but its like theres a lid on his mind  I dont feel a thing Tsukishima was the opposite He barely looked at me, but I felt  his intent to kill all over me Is it because it’s a Fullbring  sword and not a Zanpakuto Is that why I can’t  sense what’s inside him Or is it because I don’t  completely trust him yet You’re too distracted This is supposed to be a battle, remember I guess Ill just have to drag you back Kurosaki! You want Ichigo to become strong, dont you Then be quiet and watch It seems that during the time  he lost his Soul Reaper powers, he also lost the resolve to face battle Hold on, Ichigo Ill drag you back into the battlefield Why Just what the hell are you! Shut up Quit whining Its irritating Just what are you after! Are you… Are you really on my side! Hey, what are you talking about I told you our purpose at the beginning Our goal is to have you regain  your Soul Reaper powers We’re teaching you Fullbring  as a preliminary step And this is how youre doing it Sorry, but after what  you’ve just done to me, I’m having doubts about  trusting you as my ally! Like I said, what’re you talking about What! If you don’t fully trust me… Then why did you even agree  to this training I proposed Did you think trust didnt matter as long as it helped get your powers back You thought you could escape from us even if we suddenly turned on you Without your powers Dont make me laugh The reality is that, right  now, youve lost your sight and are quite helpless Damn you! You fool… It was over for you the moment you stepped  into this field with me! Bastard… Whats the matter Do you want to die Dodge for your life, coward Yukio Inoue! Whats wrong! I wonder what happened… Why dont you see for yourself Ginjo! Its useless…if that’s all you’ve got Kurosaki! Kurosaki! Koten… Don’t bother Your voice wont reach outside from there And no matter what you try,  that cage is unbreakable Look on the bottom right of the cage You cannot break or go through that cage Its a restricted area Thats the rule of this game Sorry I cant hear what youre saying Where is he Left or right! Nice try… Hey, you’re dodging better than I expected Even if I cant see… I can tell your movements  by your presence and sound Presence and sound, huh Whats wrong You said you could dodge me From my presence or sound, was it Dont make me laugh! As if you can dodge me like that! I’ve been going easy on you! I’ve let you evade me! Did you think you were dodging  me with your own skills! Its over I’m going to kill Chad and Inoue You saw this coming, didn’t you The moment you realized  I wasn’t on your side I can’t speak! And I can’t see him! Dont worry Im going to kill you, too Wait Ginjo! Stop! I can see Ginjo! No, thats not… It’s  not him I’m seeing That’s his… Spiritual Pressure! Kurosaki! Well done Its complete What The moment Fullbring is complete, somebody has to make sure to contain that power by putting their life on the line Because the soul squeezed into  the item is released all at once, without that person, the wielder’s body cannot  withstand the force Thats why I needed you to complete  Fullbring in front of me… Ginjo… Sorry… I was a cheesy bad guy, I know Welcome… to Xcution I put up quite a good act as a villain! You were terrible First of all, you talk too much That won’t cut you for  being the final boss Who cares! As long as I looked evil! Second, you were playing dirty Only a small fry that gets killed in  the beginning would do such a thing Oh, come on… Xcution Dictionary Whats this Yes All I need now is that  one, and this level is cleared! You think itll go so smoothly Huh! A ball! Why! Too bad Start over! "
" Ginjo! Well done Its complete What The moment Fullbring is complete, somebody has to make sure to contain that power by putting  their life on the line Ginjo… Sorry… I was a cheesy bad guy, I know Welcome to Xcution O-One One hundred! That’s it! That’s my limit! I’m not doing it any more! What You tired already What do you mean “already”! How many sets of a hundred pushups are you gonna make me do! That was only your fourteenth set Only! Are you crazy You trying to turn me into  a wrestler or something! Stop whining with just fourteen sets Why don’t you do one more  set to match your name You had to say that! I hate those kinds of puns! Liar I know you wear a T-shirt  that says “15” on it How do you know that! That stalker network of  yours gives me the creeps! Kurosaki’s working hard I’m coming in! Riruka, you came in  before I answered again Shut up! I’m leaving your breakfast here! Oh, wait! Let’s eat together, Riruka! I just had some donuts, so no thanks! It seems like… all she eats are donuts… Okay, I’ve finished loading it Thank you for everything, Yukio Don’t mention it I do this all the time Okay, I’ll be leaving then What about Ichigo He’s not going to school today He said he completed his Fullbring and just has a few kinks to work out Then it looks like he  might be done tonight Sado, what made you decide to go back to school all of a sudden Did something happen You haven’t been coming all  this time, so…you know… If Tsukishima’s aim is preventing the reawakening  of Ichigo’s powers, was it really necessary to attack  Ichigos family and you Wouldn’t that have  been counterproductive Could he have actually been trying to corner Ichigo to induce  him to acquire Fullbring For what purpose I don’t know But it makes more sense that way I think the key to answering  that question… lies in Tsukishima’s powers Have you noticed anything different  since that day, Inoue Yes Remember how I said I could remember Mr Tsukishima  inside my old memories He’s a very dear person to me… That’s what I find myself  thinking sometimes I see Then we can’t leave things as they are In any case, I think it’d be a good idea for us to sort through  what’s happened so far I agree Hey, you! What You’re not here You put me through all this trouble and now you disappear without a word! I’ll bet you’re just an airhead  that all the boys fussed over- Dear Riruka, Breakfast was delicious Thank you so much! Let’s have donuts together again S-Stupid! Well How’s Ichigo Kurosaki doing He’s doing well He’ll be a Fullbringer by tonight Oh yeah What Not interested It’s not that But won’t Mr Tsukishima sense it, too Yeah… He’ll probably start making his move What do you mean by “start  making his move”  Yukio, let me out Isn’t Ichigo what Tsukishima is after That attack said it all—even  I could tell that And prior to that, there were a number of strange incidents happening around Ichigo that looked like  Tsukishima’s doing Saying he’ll “start making his  move” doesn’t make sense He’s already taking action What Women are such nitpickers What was that for! I think you deserved that, Kugo… Whatever Thus far, he’s only messed with Ichigo to fan his sense of imminent danger But now, Ichigo’s Fullbring  is about to become complete This time, he’ll attack like he means it, that’s what I’m saying Attack! Why! What is it that he wants to  do with Ichigo’s powers Who knows What! You’re so unreliable! But even Tsukishima should have a hard time dealing with Ichigo once  he’s acquired Fullbring If Tsukishima wants Ichigo… His first move would be to eliminate those who are  trying to protect Ichigo and then isolate him That means we’re in danger, too Yeah… And Chad and Orihime Inoue would definitely become targets, as well Orihime! ‘Morning, Tatsuki Good to see you again, Chad What happened to you! You haven’t been coming to school at all! You okay Solid as always Now if only Ichigo would… Kurosaki said he won’t be coming today What! How come you know about  Ichigo’s business Ichigo’s doing his best  to get himself together Did Ichigo get involved  in something again! You’re in the way That’s none of your business Come on, we’ll be late for class Orihime, you too! You mean those two are targeted! Then why’d you let them leave here! We had no choice We can’t keep them locked  up here for our convenience I’m guessing they’ll look into Tsukishima on their  own to help Ichigo Huh! But right now, we can’t take the risk of joining them in trying to determine  Tsukishima’s objective We must protect Ichigo at all cost in order to achieve our goal But… I’m sorry, but it’s the best we can do Yukio, I’m going to rest for a bit Sure, I’ll handle things Inoue! How’d it look I went around the campus, but didn’t sense that Spiritual  Pressure from anyone else That means it was only from  Tatsuki and the other two Those three definitely  had traces of contact with someone possessing  strong Spiritual Pressure We can’t prove it, but was it Tsukishima Oh no! Does that mean he did something  to Tatsuki and the others It’s okay, Inoue Nothing seems out of the  ordinary about them But what’s certain is that he’s  always lurking around Ichigo Mr Tsukishima is What is it No… I’m all right Let’s go Yeah What was that…  Why  Who’s that girl Beats me Maybe she’s looking for someone Jeez… These things make it harder to see That girl’s causing  me nothing but trouble Stop that, you’re acting silly Admit it, You care about “that girl” You’re wrong! I just came to buy donuts And I just happen to pass by the school that Chad and that girl go to… So I just thought maybe I should  check things out for a bit… Did you just say “Chad and that girl” It’s nothing Who are you By “that girl,” did you mean Orihime I might’ve… I came to see her Where are they Chad and that girl… They already left… Huh Then where are they now I don’t know what business  you have with them, but I’m not going to tell someone so suspicious… Tell me It’s important! KARAKURA GENERAL HOSPITAL Thank you very much Sado… Well Did you find out anything Ishida was told he couldn’t  leave the hospital yet, but he’s been gone since around noon I’ll try calling Ishida Okay Riruka Huh What’re you doing here Its not what it looks like! I came to buy donuts when… At the hospital It doesn’t matter where I buy them! Never mind that! What’re you two doing here! We came to see our friend… You mean, Uryu Ishida Oh, I see… So the two of you are racking your meager brains to investigate Tsukishima Why do you think that Don’t patronize me! You must’ve realized… Tsukishima is making contact  with Ichigo’s classmates You can’t fool me We had no such intention But Kurosaki’s been  working desperately hard, so we thought we might lend a hand… Are you guys stupid! You’re up against Tsukishima! Didn’t Ginjo tell you! He’s the kind of guy who kills Substitute Soul Reapers  and even his friends! And you’re trying to investigate  him by yourselves! You guys are way over your head! You’re right I’m not very strong, and I’m not sure that  doing this will even help But Kurosaki has always protected me That’s why I can’t  do anything knowing that Kurosaki might be a target I want to help him…even if only a bit… What’s the matter No, it’s nothing Anyway, give up your crazy idea… of trying to find Tsukishima That’s all I’m saying! Riruka Thank you What was that for You’re creeping me out! is not available  At the tone, please leave your message  It’s no use… Let’s head back to where  Ginjo and the others are We should be able to contact  Ishida before it gets dark We can come up with a new plan after that Like Riruka said, investigating that guy by  ourselves is dangerous Sado, what’s wrong No…it’s nothing I wonder if there is any other way to learn about Mr Tsukishima… Sushigawara The guy who was with Tsukishima  when you were attacked It certainly seems likely that he knows about Tsukishima’s powers… But isn’t he also a Fullbringer Yes But… He didn’t seem all that strong Here If he said he was from  Miyashita High School, MIYASHITA HIGH SCHOOL then this is the place I don’t have a good feeling about this… Excuse me We’re looking for someone Who the hell are you Huh Hey! What do you and your bimbo want! You mocking us! Jeez, what’re they doing… I warned them not to… If they cause a scene,  Tsukishima will notice them Yes, I will What’re you doing out here Riruka… Come back here, dammit! Why is this happening! I sort of figured they weren’t  the type to talk with us You were right They wouldn’t listen… I thought it was a good idea, though We couldn’t learn a thing  about Mr Tsukishima What’s wrong! When did we become friends  with Mr Tsukishima What’re you talking about Didn’t we go with him to the Soul  Society to rescue Kuchiki… No, that’s not right… Inoue! What is the matter with me Shall I tell you Hi there Riruka tells me you’ve  been looking for me So what’s up Mr Tsukishima, you didn’t…! I did… But don’t worry about it It was all in the plan Impressive! In just this short time, you’ve increased your power tremendously I did it to defeat you! Oh, it’s Yukio I thought all he did was play  video games by himself, but he’s learned how to  play together with others Shitenkoshun! Sado! I’m okay We can beat him with just our powers… Not bad at all You might be quite useful to me What! Brazo Izquierdo… Del Diablo! Now, Inoue! Tsubaki! Mr Bunny is done  Orihime  Did you wait for me, again  Why Inoue! What’s wrong! Why is this happening Inoue! It’s time to wake up now Who am I Bastard! What did you do to Inoue! What, you say The same as what I did to you Okay, Ichigo! Show everyone your  completed Fullbring power! Huh Why should I You’ve become stronger Admit  it, you’re curious too, right Not really I don’t feel like showing  it off at this moment But I want to see it right now! Show it to me! Pretty please! Xcution Dictionary! Ichigo! Your Fullbring is nearly  complete! Congratulations! Uh…Yeah… I made this to celebrate the occasion! See It’s a Fullbring doll It comes with a carrying strap too I even made you into a  character in the game Thanks… Today is an auspicious day! Ichigo! This celebration is for  you! Try to look happier! Uh…Yeah… "
" Oh Karin! Hi there Impressive! In just this short time, you’ve increased your  power tremendously I did it to defeat you! Now, Inoue! Tsubaki! Why is this happening It’s time to wake up now Who am I Bastard! What did you do to Inoue! What, you say The same as what I did to you I’m too late Inoue and Sado’s  Spiritual Pressures It doesn’t look like they’ve  been injured, but I sense another Spiritual Pressure Okay, break time’s over Yeah Yukio I’m on it “Invaders Must Die” We’re almost done You can all look forward  to getting rid of our despicable powers Yes I hope so Man, look at the time! Oh, Ishida Are you okay now Not yet… But I had some paperwork at  school to take care of Heard you got hurt pretty  bad from falling off a tree, while trying to save a cat That’s not like you Hurt trying to save a cat That Ryuken… What sort of explanation  did he give to the school! A Spiritual Pressure! During my absence, did you come across anyone suspicious Huh Nope, if you’re talking about  those punks, they didn’t come Besides, Ichigo, the guy they’re after,  has been playing hooky You think he’s doing one  of his part-time jobs Maybe I should go check  out his work place again You mean, go bother him That other Spiritual Pressure I sensed from where  Inoue and Sado were… It belongs to him No doubt about it… And… I sensed the same Spiritual Pressure from  those two, as well… What’s going on Why did he approach Asano and Kojima, who  don’t possess any powers And that odd sensation mixed in with each of their Spiritual Pressures… What is he plotting Brother Ichi didn’t come  home yesterday, either I see… Has anything… unusual happened around Kurosaki or to anyone else in  your family recently Huh For example…you saw someone  or felt something… I’m not really sure when  you put it that way… Besides, Brother Ichi’s pretty numb when it comes to things like that… There could be a ghost or monster right in front of his eyes and he  wouldn’t notice it, I think Is that so… Do you know where he’s  working part-time Wait here a sec ODD JOBS SERVICE - UNAGIYA Here you go Unagiya If Brother Ichi’s there, tell him he doesn’t need to come home What’s wrong No, nothing… See you Who was it Brother’s friend Yeah Ishida That’s the first time  I really spoke to him, but he’s exactly like  Brother Ichi said Okay, that should be enough… You can stop now What’s the matter  You’re awfully quiet Aren’t you going to complain Want to do another set Just kidding By now you must’ve built some stamina Stamina That’s right Fullbring is performed  using your flesh and blood To fully control it, you need  a crazy amount of stamina I see… So that’s why you put me  through this crazy training… You recover fast too That’s good When your Fullbring became complete, you saw something, didn’t you I knew it… You should’ve seen me glowing as a Spiritual Pressure  with your smashed eyes I made you fight without your  sight to make sure of that That’s proof that your Soul Reaper powers are starting to come back After you lost your  Spiritual Pressure… the remnants of your remaining  Spiritual Pressure laid dormant, collected in one  location for a long time… That’s why we used  the Spiritual Pressure that flowed inside of you from your Combat Pass via Fullbring  to stimulate the Spiritual Pressure inside  of you and awaken it After that, once you build up your stamina and learn to  control Fullbring fully, your Soul Reaper powers will merge on their own with Fullbring… giving you powers beyond  that of a Soul Reaper Here Give it a try Your Fullbring should  be fully complete now Yukio On it Ginjo… Impressive It’s like you’re  a totally new person You’ll need a name… For your Fullbring UNAGIYA I don’t see their car… They must not be home… Welcome back Looks like you managed to complete it You were taking so long that I was beginning to worry when the battery in this thing  was going to run out Yeah, sorry to take up your time In any case, you should go home for  today and see your sisters They must be worried… after not hearing from you Yikes! That’s right! I haven’t  called them at all! How many days have I  been training here! Just about one whole day, maybe Huh That’s because I fast-forwarded  time while you were inside You should thank me Now go on home I’m sure they’re all  anxiously waiting for you Now…I can protect them… My family… Everyone It’s strange… I can sense the odd Spiritual Pressure, but they appear to have  no awareness of it… And I couldn’t ask them  if they had met him Inoue said that she was attacked by the same  guy who attacked me… If this is all his power’s doing… Is it possible! That was impressive! He actually managed to  complete his Fullbring… Now we can say farewell  to our despicable powers The question, though, is  how Tsukishima will act… What’s wrong, guys Aren’t you happy We finally remembered About what What we’re supposed to do Don’t tell me! “Dirty Boots!!” They’re still up I got them worried… I’m home… Welcome home! Thank goodness! You’re finally back! Yeah I’m sorry I’m so late… We were waiting for you! Hey, whose shoes are An old friend came to visit today! An old friend Who Guess I don’t know without a hint Okay, here’s a hint! He’s one of our cousins! A cousin That’s right! A cousin! A cousin… What cousin do we know well enough that he’d drop by… Brother came home! Hi, Ichigo It’s been a while See Aren’t you surprised, Brother It’s Shu! We haven’t seen him since Grandpa  Rin’s memorial service… How many years has it been It’s so good to see him again! He came this evening and  we had dinner together! It was so nice to have dinner  with Shu after all these years! He showed up unannounced That part of you hasn’t changed, Shu Sorry Did I cause you guys trouble N-No, of course not… C’mon, Brother! Say hi to Shu! Tsukishima! You bastard! What’re you doing here! Brother! Brother Ichi! Stop it, Brother! What’re you doing! What’s wrong with you, Brother Ichi! You’re hurting Shu! Let him go! Are you angry that Shu  dropped by without notice! What’s wrong with you, Brother Ichi! What did you do to Yuzu and Karin! Brother!! Brother Ichi! It’s all right, Yuzu, Karin Ichigo’s always so serious He must be angry with  me for staying so late Answer me!! Yuzu…would you mind Okay… It’s probably Keigo and the others Hey, good evening, Yuzu Hi! Here, go ahead and use these slippers! Oh, thanks! We’re coming in! Shu, we’re here… Huh Oh, Ichigo’s here, too You’re right Hey Ichigo! We hear you’ve been staying  out late these days! You should come home earlier! You’re making Yuzu  and Karin feel lonely! That’s okay We’re not lonely! I asked them to come Hi, Shu! I wanted to see everyone since  it’s been such a long time It’s been a while, hasn’t it Don’t give me that scary look I’m sorry about calling  everyone so late at night, but tomorrow’s Sunday,  so it’s okay, right You know… maybe I’ll call Chad and Orihime, too Orihime It’s me That’s right Tsukishima Huh What are you talking about We met just the other day Actually, I’m at  Ichigo’s place now… What the! Mr Tsukishima!! Tell me, Tsukishima… What did you do to everyone! Are you all right, Mr Tsukishima Yeah…I’m okay… You’re not okay! You’re bleeding! Tsukishima! Ichigo! What’re you doing! I don’t know what  you’re so upset about, but that’s no way  to treat your relative who you haven’t seen in years! Relative! No! This guy is… What about him! Never mind! Apologize!! You don’t understand… Tsukishima is… Apologize to Mr Tsukishima! Ichigo… Ichigo… Hey Ichigo, what’s gotten into you You’re nuts Yeah, what happened Brother Ichi… Brother… What happened to you What’s gotten into you, Brother Ichi You should apologize Hey! You’re acting strange, Brother Ichigo Hey, are you okay, Ichigo What are you doing Ichigo You’re to blame, Brother Brother Ichi You… Kurosaki What’s happening… Is this Tsukishima’s power! Oh, if it isn’t Ichigo! What happened Now that I look at you  you’re covered in sweat What happened UNAGIYA Here, drink this Stay here until you calm down… If you want to tell me about  what happened, tell me Thank you… Ms Ikumi… Ms Ikumi… Forget it! Just be quiet! Who could it be at this hour Coming Tell her what happened No… There’s no way I can tell her Ms Ikumi doesn’t know about Soul Reapers or Hollows or Fullbring… Telling her such things out of the blue would only make her uneasy! Ichigo! You’re in luck, Ichigo Mr Tsukishimas here to pick you up! What is this! What the hell’s going on! Anybody! Isn’t there anybody left whos still sane! Ichigo! Ginjo! He got them! Riruka… And Kutsuzawa… And Yukio… And Jackie… Tsukishima got them all!! Ichigo, make sure to come up with a name for your Fullbring by the next episode What I have to think of one Let’s see… You better come up with one soon Otherwise, we’ll just give it a name  that sounds really embarrassing Oh, I have one! Now that’s a good one! Huh What Wait, what! The Complete Quincy Looks like he ran away again What’re you here for There’s somewhere I have to go now… Why don’t you join me No thanks Even if I told you  that’s where Uryu is It’s none of your business But if you so insist then I suppose"
" Hi, Ichigo It’s been a while Tsukishima! You bastard! What’re you doing here! Brother! Brother Ichi! Stop it, Brother! What’re you doing! What’s wrong with you, Brother Ichi! You’re hurting Shu! Answer me! Shu, we’re here! Huh Oh, Ichigo’s here, too You’re right Hey Ichigo! We hear you’ve been staying  out late these days! You should come home earlier! You’re making Yuzu  and Karin feel lonely! That’s okay We’re not lonely! I asked them to come Oh Karin! Hi, Shu! I wanted to see everyone since  it’s been such a long time It’s been a while, hasn’t it Don’t give me that scary look I’m sorry about calling  everyone so late at night, but tomorrow’s Sunday,  so it’s okay, right You know… maybe I’ll call Chad and Orihime, too What the! Mr Tsukishima!! Tell me, Tsukishima… What did you do to everyone! Tsukishima! Ichigo! What’re you doing! Never mind! Apologize!! You don’t understand… Tsukishima is… Apologize to Mr Tsukishima! Ichigo… Ichigo… Hey Ichigo, what’s gotten into you You’re nuts Yeah, what happened Brother Ichi… Brother… What happened to you What’s gotten into you, Brother Ichi You should apologize Hey! You’re acting strange, Brother Ichigo Hey, are you okay, Ichigo What are you doing Ichigo You’re to blame, Brother Brother Ichi You… What is this! What the hell’s going on! Anybody! Isn’t there anybody left whos still sane! Ichigo! Ginjo! He got them! Riruka… And Kutsuzawa… And Yukio… And Jackie… Tsukishima got them all! We should be safe here for a while I kept this place in the  event Tsukishima found all of our safe houses Not even Riruka and Kutsuzawa know of this place, much less Tsukishima Damn it Damn it Why the hell did this happen! Why! Ichigo It’s your fault, Ginjo! This all happened because  you dragged me into this! Yeah…you’re right I’m sorry Damn it! I know! You guys were only trying to help! It’s not your fault! It’s nobody’s fault Don’t go blaming yourself Before they attacked me, Yukio and the others said… We finally remembered  About what  Guys!  Remember What’d he mean by that From what Chad said, I thought Tsukishima’s power was the ability  to disrupt memories… But rather than their  memories being disrupted, they actually sounded more like things became clear  after they remembered I’m thinking Tsukishima’s power… is not a disruption of memory, but a manipulation of the past Tsukishima’s “Book of the End” is a Fullbring that uses a bookmark This is purely speculation, but if a new power arose  from “Book of the End, it coincides with its original  form as a bookmark Tsukishima places his presence in the pasts of the people he cuts down Is that even possible! I don’t know But you heard what the guys that were stolen by Tsukishima said It’s far beyond a matter of trusting or not trusting Tsukishima To them, Tsukishima is someone who was always there in their past as a family member, a friend, a lover, someone deeply connected to them Otherwise, there’s no way they’d speak of their memories of him  in the ways that they did They weren’t confused and they didn’t lose their memories He is already a fact of their pasts Shedding tears won’t  miraculously bring back their memories like  it does in fairy tales To all of them… The two of us who  don’t know Tsukishima are the crazy ones! Would… Would… killing Tsukishima  return them to normal! I’ll be honest with you Even if we kill Tsukishima, there’s no guarantee  they’ll return to normal We might be despised by our families and friends as  nothing but murderers and they might continue to think of us as having gone crazy But regardless of whether we can or cannot undo the effects, the only way to sever their bond with Tsukishima is to kill him! Can you do it Can you really kill Tsukishima, when there’s no guarantee  it’ll undo everything Oh, boy… You guys are having a  pretty disturbing conversation So this is where you were Ginjo! I thought you said you were the only one who knew about that place! Yeah… Then how! Damn! Making our escape comes first You can’t get away That was dangerous, Kugo Wasn’t that your precious hideaway How’d you know I’d be there How What’re you talking about How I always do, of course Whenever we’re separated, we always make sure to know where each of us are, remember Something really is  wrong with you, Kugo C’mon, let’s go back Don’t worry Neither Mr Tsukishima nor I, or anybody, is angry with you two In fact, we feel sorry for you It’s okay We’ll bring you back to  your senses right away All right Ichigo! He’s offering to take  us to Tsukishima It’s just what we need You… I’ve made up my mind We’re here So this is the place Hey Tsukishima! Wait! Ginjo! Don’t charge blindly If his powers are what  I think they are… One slash and it’s all over! Knock it off I’m unarmed I don’t want to fight you two Let’s go inside and talk You really think we’d walk into a house  full of potential traps Are you kidding me If I were going to set a trap, I’d have set it in the  forest on your way here You heard him Now, come on inside Welcome back! What took you, Ichigo You’re late! What’re you just standing there for Yeah, come on! Come on and join us! Hey, Ichigo! Ichigo! Brother! Ichigo! Welcome back, Ichigo! Ichigo! Ichigo! Brother Ichi! Brother! It’s all right, Ichigo These people consider Tsukishima  to be their friend, but they consider you  a friend, as well They won’t attack  you without warning Stay calm… I’m so happy! Shu said he’s not  angry at all, Brother! That’s right! You’re lucky, Ichigo!  Shu’s such a nice guy! You should apologize while you can! He’s right You should  apologize properly Ichigo, apologize Apologize, Ichigo Apologize! Apologize! Please apologize Apologize Apologize Tsukishima… -Hey! -Ichigo! Brother! Damn it! He couldn’t bear it Damn! I want to kill Tsukishima right now But I couldn’t fight him in there If I fought him back there,  I would’ve dragged  everyone into the fight! Everyone…  Yuzu…Karin…Tatsuki… Keigo…Mizuiro…Ms Ikumi… Everyone!  Oh, good You seem to be doing well Yeah Looks like he’s brimming with energy I’m glad Oh I thought you didn’t  like me, but maybe not You voluntarily got  yourself surrounded Now then… I destroyed the stairway Yukio’s about the only person that can possibly come up here Now… There’s nothing to hold you back Fight with everything you’ve got! Ichigo! Damn you! No you don’t! You’re not getting away! So that’s your Fullbring You’ve come a long  way in a short time Is that supposed to be a compliment Say it while you still can I came here to kill you Chad…Inoue… Sotenkishun! I reject Don’t… Don’t do this, Inoue… Don’t heal his arm! He’s! I’m impressed You heal amazingly as usual Thank you! Chad… Are you two also like the others I don’t know what you mean by that… I’m actually confused because  you’re different Ichigo… Why are you doing this Kurosaki… Have you forgotten how Mr  Tsukishima has always helped us We were able to save Kuchiki And bring Inoue back from Hueco Mundo And were able to defeat Aizen It was all thanks to Mr Tsukishima! Even when we first  awakened to our powers And when Inoue went  alone to Hueco Mundo Mr Tsukishima was… always there for us We were able to come this far all because Mr Tsukishima  was there for us! Do you understand what’s going on Ichigo Guys! Snap out of it! Look! Mr Tsukishima bought  me this new game console Huh He also renovated my bar What! Join this side, Kugo, and something  good will happen to you too I won’t fall for that! I won’t! I think… Xcution Dictionary! Today I will explain my power,  “Book of the End” Mr Tsukishima! WASABI PASTE Look! FRESH WASABI ROOT CHOCOLATE AND WASABI MOUSSE I made this wasabi-chocolate  parfait from the recipe you taught me! Please have some! Mr Tsukishima Do you remember this Back when I was feeling depressed, SNUGGLE SNUGGLE you dressed in this and  let me snuggle you Thank you so much! Maybe I inserted the wrong  kind of memories…"
" Oh, good You seem to be doing well Yeah Looks like he’s brimming with energy I’m glad Now then… I destroyed the stairway Yukio’s about the only person  that can possibly come up here Now… There’s nothing to hold you back Fight with everything you’ve got! Ichigo! So that’s your Fullbring… You’ve come a long  way in a short time Is that supposed to be a compliment Say it while you still can I came here to kill you Chad… Inoue… Sotenkishun! I reject Don’t… Don’t do this, Inoue… Don’t heal his arm! He’s Good job As usual, your healing  powers are remarkable Thank you! Chad… Are you two also like the others I don’t know what you mean by that I’m actually confused  because you’re different Kurosaki… Have you forgotten how Mr Tsukishima has always helped us We were able to save Kuchiki… And bring Inoue back from Hueco Mundo… It was all thanks to Mr Tsukishima! Do you understand what’s going on… Ichigo Ichigo! Hey, pay attention Right now, you’re fighting against us You can’t afford to be  worrying about others! Who is this guy  Did he make this fall  What did he just do  I don’t see anything in his hand  The chain on the fallen  chandelier isn’t cut  Each of its screws came out  What is this guy’s Fullbring  We’re not letting you get past us! There is a place and  time for everything Science fiction novels talk about going back in time with a time machine and splitting the future  into different timelines Tampering with things invariably  changes the future That’s because time  is believed to flow from the past to the future But my Fullbring, “Book of  the End,” splits the past That’s possible because my power doesn’t manipulate time and memories my power is the ability to insert “my very presence”  into a person’s past So Ginjo’s guess was correct Ginjo guessed my power I’m surprised I underestimated him I didn’t think he was that smart Anyway, I know it’s sad, but I want you to understand The past they experienced and the past you experienced are  two separate things That’s a roundabout  way of putting it Why don’t you just say you’ve changed it to something  different with your powers That’s where you’re wrong It didn’t become something else Everyone except you… has lived their lives with me You’re the only one leading  a life from a false past You must be sad that it’s  only different for you But you don’t have to worry Soon, that feeling will have  never existed in the first place Inoue… Chad… Why, Ichigo This is not what I became strong for… I didn’t become strong to fight you! Wait, Chad! I… Brazo Izquierdo Del Diablo! Damn it… Damn it… Damn it… Why… How did this happen…! I wanted to protect you guys! So why! I… I…! What did I regain my powers for! Tsukishima! Ichigo! “Dirty Boots”! “Time Tells No Lies” Stop it, Kutsuzawa! Damn it, not you guys too! I have to do something … “Doll House”! You’re not getting past us! Damn it…! What the hell… He’s not tough at all… What… It’s broken…!  You should be happy I  didn’t hit your body! That last spin was so good There’s no telling what  would’ve happened to you What do you mean My Fullbring is… “Jackpot Knuckle”! I can control the odds and draw out the jackpot  right from the start! That last punch hit the  jackpot and the guard of your sword just happened  to snap from wear and tear! The coin I flicked earlier hit the jackpot and the screws of the chandelier just happened to come loose enough  for it to come falling down! Come at me, Kugo Ginjo! I’ll show you what a one  shot, one kill really is! Damn… I can’t allow Ichigo  to be cut down as well… I don’t have time to  bother with you guys! Let’s go! Tsukishima! What’s the matter Poor thing… So angry that you can’t  even find the words Getsuga Tensho! He’s fast!  He’s able to unleash  Getsugatensho even in Fullbring mode… Or rather, he learned how to…  His powers have reawakened…  Not only that,  but the speed of his attacks are  faster than I had anticipated He really did succeed in combining  Soul Reaper powers with Fullbring… Damn you…! Tsukishima! And as expected, despair helped  him complete his power…  Oh, boy… I think he’s complete Ichigo! Keep your eyes over here! No you don’t! It’s time Time! What’re you talking about I don’t stand a chance  against the four of them… Where’s Ichigo Why are you protecting him… Please stop it… Chad… Inoue… You took the words right  out of my mouth… Don’t do this, Ichigo! Don’t you get it I…have no desire to fight you! Tsukishima! Stop hiding behind my friends! Come on out and fight! Where’d he go… Damn it… Ginjo… Damn it… Ginjo! What’s going to happen!  My “Book of the End” inserts my presence at will into  the other party’s past… Will Ginjo, just like all the others…  think of Tsukishima as his friend…   Ginjo! Are you all right, Ginjo! Please… Ginjo! Shut up… Stop paying so much attention  to me, Kurosaki… Ginjo! I thought I told you, don’t  let Tsukishima get you from behind, or it’s all over! Are you all right…! Ginjo… I don’t know But… Right now, I still consider  that guy to be my enemy… And I still think of you as my friend I see… Good I don’t know why Tsukishima’s  power didn’t take effect Maybe there are individual  differences in how long it takes for his  power to take effect… Or maybe he deliberately didn’t let them take  effect for a reason Either way… We have to defeat Tsukishima  now, while we can… Once his powers take effect, there’ll be nothing we can do! What happened to you What’s gotten into you, Brother Ichi You’re acting strange, Brother Brother Ichi… You’re to blame, Brother Hey! Brother… You… …Right! Kurosaki Ishida…! Which side is he on…!  Ishida was also cut down by Tsukishima  So who healed his wounds!  Was it Inoue  Inoue was cut down by Tsukishima  Did she heal Ishida before  she considered Tsukishima as her friend If it was after she considered  Tsukishima as a friend, it would mean she healed Ishida  to make him part of Tsukishima’s army Which is it!  Ishida!  So you’re… one of them, too Ishida! Ishida… Kurosaki…come here I saw what’s going on downstairs Relax I’m on your side You’re not… What’s wrong Hurry, Kurosaki… Ishida…! Kurosaki…! Don’t you get it! The guy who cut me… is the guy standing behind you! Kurosaki! Ginjo… Why Is it because of  Tsukishima’s power… Yeah Definitely because of  Tsukishima’s power… But make no mistake I didn’t become your enemy because Tsukishima cut me I let Tsukishima cut me twice so I could return to my original self Your Fullbring is mine Just what I’d expect from  Mr Tsukishima’s friends! You’re all very strong! I’ve been meaning to  ask, but who are you I’m Mr Tsukishima’s apprentice! He had an apprentice You haven’t heard about  me from Mr Tsukishima Like how I’m useful, or adorable -Not a word -Not a word In celebration of Uryu  Ishida Joining the Battle! QUIZ: WHAT’S UNDERNEATH THE GLASSES It’s been so long… so while I don’t think  you’ve forgotten… But let’s assume you saw  me for the first time, try to guess my true identity You’re wearing white, so  you’re the laundry guy! Laundrymen don’t wear white You’re good at sewing,  so you’re a mother! Huh Who’s! You’re wearing white,  so you’re a squid! Okay, let’s try to get  away from the clothes! Eyeglasses You’re wearing white, so cotton! You’re just trying to make  fun of me, aren’t you! "
" So you’re… one of them, too Ishida! Ishida… Kurosaki… Don’t you get it! The guy who cut me is the guy standing behind you! Kurosaki! Ginjo… why Your Fullbring is mine I remember now…  Damn!  Oh dear…  Hes one of his friends, right  I think it would have been better if I  cut him with my Fullbring instead What are you talking about  He’s going to be the key  Kurosakis fate depends on  whether he can notice the  difference between what  happened to this guy and  what’s going to happen  to our next targets Besides, its no fun if we cant lose  Come on Hurry up and cut me  You and I are going to become  enemies who once betrayed each other Were really going to do this, huh  I guess I have no choice  Thats what happened If I cut someone with my  “Book of the End,” I can slip my existence  into that persons past If I cut that person again,  they return to normal I would be working closest to you So to keep you from suspecting anything, I had Tsukishima slip his existence into my past as an enemy It was the first thing we did  before doing it to the others That’s not the reason why We didnt cut you because  youd be the closest to him It was because you have  the worst acting ability Dont be stupid My acting was pretty good back there But you referred to Ichigo as Kurosaki  right after I cut you You cut him before cutting the others Thats right How very perceptive You saved me the time to explain things After I cut Ginjo, I slipped memories into the other Xcution members as well But I didnt make them  hate me as much as Ginjo I didnt have to worry about the acting abilities of  the others quite so much Shut up Looks like Kugo has succeeded Looks like it Everything weve done is  to achieve this moment I think I can safely assume  that things have gone our way So what are we going to do now We just have to wait Once Kugo does the final touches, our mission will be complete I get it now In short, not only did  you plan all this out, you changed Inoues, Sados and  Kurosakis sisters memories so you could corner Kurosaki You talk as if you figured  it out before you got here I wasn’t able to deduce that it was the power to change people’s past However… I realized something was wrong from the Spiritual Pressure  lingering around everyone You each took different actions to take down Kurosaki, didnt you You figured that much while  being immobile I’m impressed But thats just the end result What Tsukishima and I have been following the same plan to achieve a single goal Ever since the beginning That’s what you’re gonna do Okay No way…  Don’t you think that’s  a little too much  What  Are you saying you can’t  listen to my orders   Now, now, Shishigawara  We shouldnt force him to do things But you will remember  That in the past, I saved your life  It seems a single incident wasn’t  enough to convince him   In that case…  Now then…  Lets move on to the next stage  Im not interested in what his reasons were for trying to get our help We set things up so he would team up with us from the beginning Nice, here it comes There we…go! My Fullbring…  I wanted to regain my power  But I couldnt find any way to do that  I just had to tolerate it  Powerless… For seventeen months…  I thought I had finally found a way  I thought I could finally protect  everyone with my own power  But…  But…!  Is he crying Poor thing Just let him cry We have no use for him anymore And well probably never see him again Is that it  Is there nothing I can do anymore  Let me be a Soul Reaper  for a while longer I want to become strong I want to become strong and  protect people from Hollows! Those who are attacked by them And I’m going to beat him! Otherwise… I won’t be able to face my mom! Give it back! My power Give it back to me, Ginjo… What are you babbling about You got back your power because of me Whats wrong with me taking it from you Even though Im done with you,  Im not going to kill you You should be thanking me I said, give it back What more can you do I dont know But I cant give up! He’s…!  Give it back… Give it back Give me back my powers! Ginjo! Dad… Urahara…  I see…  So thats it Have your memories been changed too! You idiot… That isnt me Take a good look Look at whos holding that sword You should be able to see her now Rukia! No… Thats impossible! Rukia… Yes It’s been a while, Ichigo You’ve become so strong and mature since the last time I saw you… Not! Ouch! Crying like a pathetic fool! You turned into a wimp the moment I stopped keeping my eyes on you! Pitiful! Urahara told me about the  power of this Tsukishima guy He can write over the past… It is indeed a terrifying power But so what! No matter how much he changes your past, he cannot change your future! Lost bonds can be forged once again! Am I wrong, Ichigo! Rukia… Can I say one thing He didnt change my past, you know Dont make fun of me  with that serious look! Thats dangerous! You idiot! Even if its been a while,  thats a pretty harsh reaction! You fool! This sword has no blade! Come to think of it, what is that sword This is a sword that  Urahara prepared for you Thanks to this, I can give  you Soul Reaper powers again! Dont be ridiculous Just because he looks like a Soul Reaper doesnt mean his powers have returned The reason why Kurosaki was  able to become a Soul Reaper the first time around  was because he already had Soul Reaper powers to begin with But he no longer has any Soul Reaper powers! Thats because Ive taken them from him! He has absolutely nothing Theres no way your  Spiritual Pressure alone could bring back his powers! You idiot! It’s not just Rukia Renji! Byakuya! Toshiro! Kenpachi! Ikkaku! We put all of our Spiritual  Pressure into that sword! Restoring Ichigo’s Spiritual Pressure would be a piece of cake! You said your name was Ginjo, right You only stole the top layer of Ichigos power, which was  fused with his Fullbring The power that comes from within Ichigo is not something that  you could ever steal! Ichigo! They dont know that this isnt enough to make you give up hope! They dont know what kinds of hopeless situations youve overcome! Show them, Ichigo! Show them that despair  isn’t enough to stop you! Right Yeah, yeah That sure is amazing! Things wont be that easy! Hes fast! And his Spiritual Pressure  has increased as well!  It seems that your  strength has increased But its nothing to be surprised about Your Getsugatensho has  gotten more powerful, but is that all youve got! Guess again! This isnt enough to kill me, Kurosaki! You idiot That wasnt a Getsugatensho That was the force created  from swinging my sword What the hell What the hell is this  Spiritual Pressure! Getsuga… tensho! Ichigo! Allow me to explain what I have been doing  for the past few months Nah, you don’t have to Oh, come on Aren’t you curious to know why I have a Lieutenants badge on my squad uniform Now that you mention it, how… And so! I drew some pictures to  show you how I spent my days! On second thought, no thanks Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! Im going to give a quiz this time! Just like the last time… What! Youre the one who said to act  as if Ive never seen you before! I didnt say to make fun of me! Ill shoot you! You already did, see! Hey! Im trying to ask a question What if you hit me! Soul balancers like us… Do you want me to hit you! You four-eyes are way too serious…! Its just a quiz Why are you being so mad! You two! Hakuren! Now answer the question! I don’t think they can "
" No… Thats impossible! We put all of our Spiritual  Pressure into that sword! Restoring Ichigo’s Spiritual Pressure would be a piece of cake! Ichigo! Show them, Ichigo! Show them that despair  isn’t enough to stop you! Right Your Getsugatensho has  gotten more powerful, but is that all youve got! You missed! This isnt enough to kill me, Kurosaki! You idiot That wasn’t a Getsugatensho That was the force created  from swinging my sword What the hell What the hell is this  Spiritual Pressure! Getsuga… tensho! Sorry I missed Next time, I won’t Must retreat! I’ve got to retreat and regroup! You’re not getting away! What incredible power His physical abilities have  become even more powerful! Did the Fullbring I gave him increase his innate powers! Getsuga… tensho! Damn… It’ll take more… More than that…to kill me! You feel it, right Rukia…Renji…Byakuya… Kenpachi…Ikkaku…Toshiro… No, thats not all Hirako… Rangiku… Unohana… Hanataro… Dad… Mr Urahara… Yoruichi… And even the Old Head Captain You have all of our powers, Ichigo I thought transferring your powers to a human was a serious crime We didn’t have a choice it’s the Head Captain’s orders I understand the situation Bring that sword to me, Kisuke Urahara! Head Captain, then… Regardless of how he went about it, Ichigo Kurosaki saved our lives Now it’s our turn to  save Ichigo Kurosaki Even if it means breaking the tradition, it would bring perpetual shame to the 13 Court Guard Squads to trample  on the debt we owe him This is an order of the Head Captain! All captains and lieutenants  of the 13 Court Guard Squads are ordered to place their Spiritual  Pressures in this sword! Help Ichigo Kurosaki regain  his Soul Reaper powers! That’s how it was Nice of the Head Captain,  don’t you think Don’t be stupid It’s not the kind of sane decision  you’d expect of a leader The Head Captain would’ve probably never made a decision  like this in the past You changed all that, Kurosaki That power you received is the result of the changes you made to the Soul Society in all of your battles Accept it with honor What is it! No way There are two reasons why  the Head Captain decided to restore your Spiritual Pressure The first is as we just told you And the second reason is him Long before you ever showed up, a man was issued a Combat Pass  as a Substitute Soul Reaper… then relinquished that  position and disappeared The first Substitute Soul Reaper, Kugo Ginjo The first… Substitute Soul Reaper! What’re you talking about! He’s… When Ukitake first handed  you the Combat Pass, he must have told you this The Soul Society also has a  law covering the emergence of a Substitute Soul Reaper If the Soul Reaper is deemed  beneficial to the Soul Society, it is customary to give this to them The Substitute Soul Reaper law  was created for him! Captain Hitsugaya Be that as it may,  we’ll save the details for later Right now, concentrate all  of your attention on him! You got that right! You guys would have a problem  if he’s not focused on me! Thanks, Kurosaki If I hadn’t taken your powers, I’d be dead right now Kurosaki was crying Why Kurosaki and Mr Tsukishima  are friends… Why did it turn out like this Mr Tsukishima is the one I love… Way, way before I even met Kurosaki, he always protected me, and treated me with kindness I’ve always, always, admired him I want to do anything  Mr Tsukishima says For Mr Tsukishima,  I could sacrifice anything… That’s how I felt But… Why is it that it hurts so much when I see Kurosaki crying It hurts…so much… In my mind, in my heart and  even in the pit of my stomach Please don’t cry, Kurosaki… Please don’t cry… Please don’t cry! Thank goodness… Kurosaki isn’t crying Kuchiki… Abarai… Toshiro… They all came to stop Kurosaki Something’s not right… Why is everybody on Ichigo’s side! Didn’t they come to stop Ichigo It’s almost as though… They’ve come to defeat Ginjo! What’s the matter, you two Are you having doubts about your past Mr Tsukishima… That’s odd You don’t believe the  memories you share with me Who was it who protected  you from your parents and raised you, Orihime Who was it who gave you that pendant, Chad S-Something’s not right with me… I’m alive right now because of Mr Tsukishima, so…why… I… I believe in… Believe in Mr Tsukishima… Tsukishima! Don’t keep cramming  memories into their pasts! They’ll become unusable! Think about how many you  ruined by doing that! Whew Thank goodness… Hey, no fair… Thanks to you carelessly  unsettling them, we were easily able to  knock them unconscious Thank you very much Now Inoue and Sado have  been taken out of action They won’t have to suffer anymore We’ve already moved the  others to a safe place, so you’re now able to fight  without holding back Kugo! What I knew it! This is quite unfair! How could you take Mr Ichigo’s  power all for yourself! Hey! Giriko! Yeah! You promised to share it with all of us! Hold on, you guys! I don’t really care about  having Ichigo’s powers… Shut up! You don’t have to remind me about it I’ll give all of you guys a  portion of Ichigo’s power So this is what it’s like! Wait… Wonderful! So this is the power of  Mr Ichigo’s Fullbring! It’s as though youth is  gushing out from my body! Your comments are totally like  those of an old man, Giriko Aren’t you going to share  it with Shishigawara It’s not nice to leave him out Increasing his power would  only cause trouble When this fight’s over, kill him I thought he had an  interesting ability, though All right! Here we come, Mr Ichigo! Feel with your own body the wonderful power you’ve given us! Look at him getting carried away… It’s my fault their powers increased I’ll go Huh Hey What is this about Don’t tell me you’re going  to take on all of us alone I went easy on you You shouldn’t be dead Huh! Shouldn’t be dead, you say! You think you’re so cool  You’re such a joke! Don’t you get it It wasn’t a “You have  defeated the enemy!” It was, in fact, a  “But they evaded your attack!” “Digital Radial Invaders” You saw it, didn’t you We took your Fullbring, Ichigo Kurosaki A Fullbring that is worn  and emitted outward Thanks to you, I was able to  expand the area of incursion of my “Invaders Must Die”  beyond the screen You’re too soft, Ichigo! Ikkaku! At this point, don’t go trying to end a fight by striking with  the back of your blade Kill them good! You owe these guys that  for starting the fight Stay sharp, Madarame Sorry Not bad Shall I award bonus points No thanks Who the hell are you Looks like they spread out just right Well then, I’ll assign rooms Hold on, Kuchiki That one looks stronger Switch with me! “Switch because he looks stronger” I can’t let that go In other words, I look weak to you Shut up It’s boring to cut down small fry You appear to be a muscle-bound idiot People like you need  to be crushed by force What do you think! My “Time Tells No Lies” is also capable of something like this! The simpler the terms of my contract with the Gods of Time, the more powerful it’s manifested! My contract right now is an exceedingly simple  “increase in power”! Right now, I am more  powerful than anyone… Impossible… See What a bore You guys have changed quite a bit! Yes, we have trained and become stronger, both in mind and body We won’t get distracted so easily But you haven’t changed that much What! Can’t you tell! Look at my height! Im taller now! You’re getting easily distracted… Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers! Today, I’m giving a quiz! Question one! Guess the name of my Zanpakuto, Zabimaru Ishida! But he just said its name… Doesn’t he know the meaning of “quiz” Okay then, Ichigo! Um…Bucktoothmaru… “Bucktoothmaru” What the hell! Didn’t I say it’s Zabimaru! You knew and still said it! Okay, moving on! Hold on a second! You’re going to let that go! Let what go"
" Why isnt anyone coming… Is this…Karakura Town Cool, huh I chose an environment you’re  used to fighting in Aren’t you happy You can fight me one-on-one Sorry, but its two against one Ishida… What about your injuries Kuchiki healed me It was just first aid, though Kurosaki… I have to apologize to you Right after we returned from saving  Kuchiki in the Soul Society… You told us about the Combat Pass That’s when I got the idea  that a Substitute Soul Reaper must have existed before you And that he probably went missing If he was alive, they  should have let you know If he was dead, they should  have told you why But the fact that they did neither means that even the Soul Society  probably didnt know I should have told you this  when I thought of it Ishida… Take that! What the hell, Kurosaki! Who cares Stop dwelling on things that are over! Idiot! Like you don’t dwell on things… Did you say something Nope Lets do this! Dont get in my way! But Kurosaki  What really worries me is if their  reason was neither of them…  Thats… …impossible… Aw, man… Nobody’s out yet Taking their sweet time… Ive got nothing to do This is boring I’m going home No! We made a promise that wed come together and leave together! If you leave early, the grandpa is going to be  angry with you again, Kenny! That hurts Dont pull my ear I dont know how he did it, but he used his power to trap  me in some strange place Where are you swinging Are you really trying  your best to find me Or can you not power up if you don’t hear something like, “Or the girl dies” Looks like I got stuck  with the annoying guy… Where are you! Show yourself! Damn you! Don’t… Don’t… Don’t think you can… tempt me with these things! This is way too easy… Damn you… Maybe I should shoot her for real Where are you Whats wrong I dont think this is the right  time to be gazing at the moon I was thinking that its a  good thing Im fighting you Whys that Ichigo Kurosaki is soft He may be consumed by anger, but I hardly doubt he would be able to fight you for the sole  purpose of killing you Oh It sounds like you would never let me hit you with my sword! I despise the way you fight You dont act on your own You torment your foes by stealing bonds It is truly despicable An audacity punishable only by death Come at me I shall cut you down before  you take one swing Hey! Dont run away, you bastard! How odd  -Come on out! -No matter how I look at it,  that punch shouldnt have been able knock down such a large tree It shouldn’t even be able  to break a wooden sword  -Hey, you’re playing dirty! -But that kid…  Hes been smashing everything  with a single hit  Whats going on  Do things just work in their favor  because they set up this place  Hey! I busted your shoulder, didnt I! Looks like you were unlucky! This bastard!  He popped his shoulder back  in with just his muscles!  What kind of monster is he!  Huh What’s wrong Are you scared Im not scared, bastard! Arent you going to attack me I cant attack a woman What a gentleman But perhaps you have  a narrow world-view Have you ever met a woman  stronger than yourself It doesnt matter if  theyre stronger or not I wont attack first I see Then the only thing  that’s narrow about you is your outlook on things What is that thing that looks  like it came from a motorcycle Do you get more powerful  if you make it roar This thing Im surprised I had no idea that Soul Reapers  knew about motorcycles Yeah, kind of Youre not going to make  the first attack, right Then shut up and watch But you should at least draw your sword If you dont want to regret having such a narrow outlook in life, that is My “Dirty Boots” get  stronger the dirtier they get! And its not just my boots… Any grime on the Fullbring surrounding  my body makes me stronger! You should draw your sword Thats a good reaction! But Im not done yet! I got him  You’re finished! Impossible…  He was hit hard!  So how is it that he was  barely knocked back! All right I get it now Ill take the next one too Come on I told you… youre going to regret that attitude! Ive been training for the past 17 months so that I can fight against Aizen It doesnt matter if  youre a man or a woman All of you aren’t good enough for me Damn I thought I would be able to get  out of here if I defeated her It seems like theres no way out Its probably because Im still alive Youre conscious already Youre one tough woman Im conscious, but I wont  be able to move for a while Nows your chance to finish me off Shut up What’s that! The sky is folding! Damn it! Yukio is watching us! He figured I couldn’t defeat you, so he’s decided to wipe us  out along with the dimension You! Hurry up and kill me! If one of our Spiritual Pressures  disappears and we settle this, this dimension should  automatically open up! Kill me! Can’t do that Why! A man who lays a hand  on a woman is scum Living as scum is the  same as being dead Were forcing our way out of here That’s the logic of a child… I thought I became cynical enough where that sort of thing didn’t  sting me anymore I wish a guy like you were  the one who saved me You… Huh Aww… She died Dying to save the enemy How touching Well, Im not sure if the  enemy survived that, though Oh, good job You finally came I thought you might never find me Did you find me because you leveled up from all the traps I placed You dont seem the least bit tired How unpleasant You sure like to talk a lot You sure are violent What if I had left a  bomb in the next room You and I would have been blown up Weren’t you watching My Hyorinmaru is a sword of ice I would’ve frozen the explosion A sword of ice, huh Thats so cool! I’m not here to chat with you Me neither You can fix the broken  walls and rooms, huh What a useful ability Didnt you see This whole dimension is my ability In this dimension, I’m god I see You dont get it, do you A god can do anything For example… Something like this… You truly are a god Thats impressive Why do you keep making fun of me! You brat! Dont dodge it! Are you afraid! Dont let me dodge it then Are you holding back Of course I am! Shall I show you whatll happen if I dont hold back! You cant escape this room! The next room and the next room… the walls, the ceiling, and the  floors are all part of my ability! Theyre set to follow you  forever and crush you! Come at me! Ill kill you! Captains are just elites who  were raised in a warm home! Somebody like that could never beat me! Oh, I see… You’re an abandoned child No! I wasnt abandoned! I abandoned my stupid parents! I made that choice! You have no right to  say anything about it! I transferred all of my  dads money over to me and destroyed his company! If you ignore your children,  they learn all kinds of things! Theyre stupid for not realizing that! That feeling when I saw the news  that they had committed suicide… You lost focus from being so  busy talking about your story Damn it! Whats wrong Theyre set to follow  me until they crush me Are you sure you dont  want to shut them down Huh Whats this You saved me anyway! Of course you would! You took pity… I didn’t take pity on you And Im not interested in your past Theres no guarantee that this dimension and the other dimensions will disappear if I kill you So how about I make you a deal H-Hey! Wait a second! I wont freeze your head and your arms If you shut off your power  within five minutes, I wont kill you Damn it… Never… Never… Who the hell are you calling scared! What do you think! I think youre the one whos afraid! Damn it! Come down here! Flying is cheating! No one told me that Soul  Reapers could fly! Im not flying Im standing I dont get it! It’d be unsatisfying if I beat you without knowing what you can do, so I thought I’d try to  understand your ability first But I quit It’s a pain in the butt Do you want me to slap you like a brat Or do you want me to  destroy you like a man Choose one Thats easy! I want to destroy you like a man! Well said! What The tendons in my pinky are torn…  But more importantly,  he smashed Hozukimaru…  Well blocked! If I had hit your head, I would have split it open and  this would have been over! Youre right Im pretty lucky Are you stupid! Youre not lucky! Your spear broke with a single hit! Im the lucky one! Come at me! Im going to steal all of your  luck and leave you with nothing! I see your luck allows  you to break things That means weapons are useless Are you going to take  me on with your fists! Bring it on! Here I go! Youre kidding, right  Whats with this guy  Is he not affected at all  Thats impossible  Im hitting him  Even if I dont break  a bone with each hit, I should be leaving fractures So why…  So why is he attacking me  as if nothings wrong!  What was that just now  I didnt feel anything!  My…  My chances of hitting the  jackpot are going down!  My “Jackpot Knuckle” allows  me to make one lucky hit  Ive never used it this  many times in a row,  so I had no idea this would happen! So the chances of hitting the jackpot go down when it’s used repeatedly! Whats this It suddenly stopped working Are you worn out already! D-Damn it! Im not worn out! Damn it! All right!  Jackpot!  Your punches were pretty powerful… But luckily, when you hit a vital  spot, you didnt do much damage This was a bad matchup for you You may be a lucky guy, but Im the luckiest guy in  the 13 Court Guard Squads! Whats wrong You cant cut me from that distance The fact that youre  waiting there means that coming any closer puts  you within my range I need to think of a plan I see Youre very cautious Did my actions seem meaningful to you What about this I believe I shouldn’t view  them as meaningless acts Scatter… Senbonzakura… Rukia How are things on your end Yes, Brother! Several items ambushed me,  but everything is fine! And they are all cute… I mean,  they are all works of art! Rukia… Y-Yes, sir! Bring one back for me Xcution Dictionary! Today, Im having tea with all  of the members of Xcution! Ugh… Come on… Why arent they coming! Since no ones coming, TO JACKIE TO YUKIO I guess this segment is over"
" Whats wrong You cant cut me from that distance The fact that youre  waiting there means that coming any closer puts  you within my range I need to think of a plan Did my actions seem meaningful to you What about this I believe I shouldn’t view  them as meaningless acts Scatter… Senbonzakura… It seems like youve got guts! Wait… I haven’t lost yet! Stop, idiot Why die in a pointless battle like this Its…Its not pointless! I’m ready to throw my life  away for Mr Tsukishima! Is this Tsukishima guy really  worth risking your life for Of course! Mr Tsukishima is super strong! I would die for him! Thats not what I meant Im asking you whether  he would die for you! What does that matter! He may not die for me, but  I’ll die for him anytime! You idiot! If youre going to risk your life,  it should be on equal terms! It doesn’t matter if he’s  your boss or subordinate Only die for somebody  who’ll die for you! Throwing your life away so easily  is something a kid would do! I’ll ask you again If you’re to die here right now, will your boss risk his  life to avenge you Aren’t you going to share  it with Shishigawara It’s not nice to leave him out I thought it’d be troublesome  to increase his power When this fight’s over, kill him I thought he had an interesting  ability, though If you’re still willing  to die for him, come at me Ill kill you with everything  Ive got so you have no regrets Do you understand now You cannot cut me or  even get close to me Oh, right there What is this A trap I set When did you set this up A long time ago Does that mean you’ve been  in this dimension many times You know about my powers, right I see youve figured it out My “Book of the End” inserts my  existence into my target’s past When I cut the ground back there, it made it so I’ve been here before So your power works on  inanimate objects, too I dont remember ever saying it didnt And I just inserted myself into  your sword’s past as well Your blade will never hit me again Ive seen your sword and  all of your techniques so many times that they bore me A moment of hesitation sealed your fate You wondered if I knew about  your Senbonzakura’s… “safe zone” Due to Senbonzakura’s unique  attack method, there is… an area where the blades can never  enter in order to protect its user The area encompasses an 85  cm radius from its user Once inside, you cannot be injured That is the safe zone The safe zone even exists in its  Bankai, Senbonzakura Kageyoshi It is probably the only  weakness of Senbonzakuras invulnerable offensive and  defensive capabilities When fighting against your  Senbonzakura, one must advance, not retreat But without that knowledge, taking that action is  psychologically near impossible That is why you have  not mentioned this fact to anybody, with the exception  of a very few close relatives So you’re saying you uncovered Senbonzakura’s weakness by facing it countless times Then tell me, whom did you hear  the term safe zone from From you You havent forgotten, have you I cut you just now Now come get me, Byakuya None of the techniques you’ve  developed will work on me Thats because I helped you  develop those techniques I guess that means Senkei and Gokei wont work on you Not even Hakuteiken Its no good I cant cut it! Im not sure what kind of animal it is, but I could never cut it! I just can’t! Whats this I thought you couldnt cut cute things You fool! Dressers arent cute at all! Oh yeah I guess we have different tastes I should have filled that  stuffed animal with rocks! You finally came out of hiding, huh Are you relieved that you  can finally kill me A Soul Reapers duty  is to protect humans I have no intention of killing you Huh! Thats not what I was asking! Read between the lines, will you You think you could kill  me in a fight, dont you! Well here’s what I think! You’re full of yourself! Dodging it like its nothing, huh Cocky little bastard! Dance! Sodenoshirayuki! No matter how much you  increase its power, you are no match for me Give up Lets end this Think of me however you want But I have no intention of  killing an ordinary human A Fullbringer isn’t  an ordinary human! Addiction Shot! What is this Rukia Kuchiki! I permit you! What Why am I a stuffed animal! Oh, how cute! But you cant hold your  Zanpakuto looking like that! Come back here, Tiny Devil! Who are you calling a  Tiny Devil, you fool! This is a rabbit stuffed animal! At least call me Tiny Bunny! It’s not a rabbit, it’s a devil! Can’t you tell by looking at the tail What are you, stupid! And dont you think youre  pathetic for not being able to keep up with a stuffed animal! I can use my Flash Step! I see! When I think about it, Im only  trapped in a stuffed animal I havent lost my Spirit Energy! What! Hado Number 33: Sokatsui! It… It exploded inside of me… What I dont know what just happened,  but you sure are stupid! You dont mind if we  finish this, do you Now you understand that Fullbringers arent  ordinary humans, right You seem to care a lot about proving that youre not ordinary humans Is not being normal  that important to you Of course We were able to meet Tsukishima  because we werent normal Ginjo saved us because  we werent normal When asked what rule every animal and human in the world has to obey, most people would say  survival of the fittest There are clear differences  between the strong and the weak But its not as simple  as kill or be killed You know what true survival  of the fittest is, dont you So let me tell you a story… About how our… survival of the fittest works Let go, Riruka! No! Its mine! Why dont you let go, Gina! Dont be like that! Are you stupid Mom! Riruka took my doll! Mom! I found out I had an ability that no one else had when  I was five years old When I was six years  old, I was invincible When I was seven years old,  there was someone I liked He was a young man who moved  into our neighborhood He used coarse language,  but he had a kind voice If he saw someone in trouble,  he would run over to help them I hid him away without a second thought Everyday, Id bring him sweets  and wed eat together I was so excited because I thought  he was going to become mine But that never happened Ever since I hid him in my treasure box, hed become more and more afraid of me I couldnt bear to see the way  he looked at me any longer, so I let him go I didnt even stop to think what would happen if he  told anyone about my power The term Survival of the  Fittest is just an illusion The weak believe that they can become the predators if they work hard But they dont get eaten  because theyre weak They get eaten because  they are the minority It’s always the incompetent and loud majorities who  become the predators You and everyone else know this,  but you choose to ignore it Separated, we were the prey One who couldnt see the  value of her ability because she couldnt  protect her family One whose mind and the way he used his power were twisted  from being neglected One whose power convinced him  that he was the voice of God Someone who became alone because she used her power foolishly When Ginjo appeared  before us, he said… Are you just going to die quietly just because there are only a few of you Thats absurd! Look at history! Whether it is royalty or warriors, it was the minority  that controlled things! You havent done anything wrong The world is just too  lenient towards idiots Lets change all that Its our turn to eat them We… Somenomai… Tsukishiro! Damn it! Ill be honest with you I can understand where  you’re coming from However… I will not make that an excuse of  having to abandon my friends! Friends Why don’t you just say that it’s  the majority that matters to you! Dont make a fuss If I use Tsukishiro one more time, your entire body will be frozen Thats what I mean when I say  youre full of yourself! What! How did I get out of  the stuffed animal! I’m really sorry I didn’t want to use this  power to end our fight, but Damn it… Where did she disappear to It broke You made a wise decision  to undo your Shikai after learning that I’ve  uncovered your safe zone And your sword skills have  improved considerably But now that your sword is broken, you will have to fight  using Shikai again Whats wrong Are you unable to use Shikai  now that its broken Bankai… Senbonzakura Kageyoshi… Youre going straight into Bankai, huh But… Whether youre in Shikai or Bankai, so long as I enter your safe zone… youre powerless There are blades in the safe zone! You revealed your weakness too soon My weakness The fact that you figured  out my safe zone means I can anticipate  where your coming at If I set up my blades from  within the safe zone, it can cut you How odd I dont remember you  doing such training Things Ive trained to do  wont work on you, right I get it now It was just a desperate maneuver Trying to cut me with  that is ridiculous You can make Senbonzakura  Kageyoshi move twice as fast if you control it  with your hands, right It feels like its moving  even faster than that But you do realize it, don’t you The more you train  yourself to be faster, the narrower your safe zone  becomes It’s suicidal The safe zone is meant to give you minimal response time to  dodge your own blades in the event you lose control When you increase the  speed of your blades and narrow your safe zone, if I just disrupt your timing a little, you wont be able to dodge them Well Do you understand You cant defeat me no  matter what you do Youre using Kido now Before you fall into despair,  Ill tell you something I know how to cancel out all of  the Kido techniques you use Come on Why dont you try one out on me I see… You grabbed some of your blades… I never knew you could fight like that I used to think that battle was something you trained for and went  into fully prepared But today, for the first  time during our battle, I experienced the ecstasy of being in the moment  between life and death Thank you I enjoyed our battle If what’s hidden inside  your Combat Pass is nothing but a horrible truth… Then I will cover your eyes and ears to prevent you from learning it The Complete Quincy Honestly… Going off  on his own like that… He hasnt changed at all Sir, we have an emergency patient! Understood I’m on my way Do as you please… "
" What’s the matter! Taking your sweet time to  analyze the situation! You want to get this over with, right Same here! Just as I suspected  He didn’t simply make Kurosaki’s  Fullbring his own  His attacks are combined with the power of Kurosaki’s  Spiritual Pressure! This is going to be a problem  So, did you come up  with any great ideas What’s that supposed to mean Just that You’re the one who suggested  we analyze the situation Weren’t you trying to come with  an idea to quickly take him down Are you stupid or something There’s no such thing What There isn’t I was observing his Spiritual Pressure Listen to me His Spiritual Pressure contains your Well, I’ll be going, then Wait, Kurosaki! The fact that his attack is combined  with your Spiritual Pressure means Ah, you finally decided to come out So Did you come with a plan  while you were hiding I just checked He didn’t have any, so I came on out A Getsugatensho, huh Bring it on I almost died because  of that the last time If you’re going to beat me, I  suppose that’s the only way Don’t do it, Kurosaki! He’s egging you on! Getsugatensho! The fact that he has your Spiritual  Pressure combined with his own means it’s possible that he can  also use your techniques! Are you listening, Kurosaki! I heard you Quit nagging Who’s nagging! You have a bad habit of not  hearing people through! Listening to you won’t change a thing! It’s not as though that’s  going to diminish his powers! It does change things At least you can be careful Watch it, Kurosaki His last blow made it very clear It wasn’t just your Spiritual  Pressure and Fullbring that he took He’s probably acquired every  one of your abilities! How cruel of you… Am I not…your benefactor… Doesn’t it pain your  heart to do this… You are indeed my benefactor And I do appreciate it However, you are Ichigo  Kurosaki’s enemy I will not hesitate to kill that enemy Regardless of who they are Damn… Good, you’re finally out Captain! You got out pretty quick Shut up You’re just slow Abarai What happened to you You’re a mess You look pathetic! Sorry… I escaped that dimension quite  a while ago via the explosion, but I was unable to move  for some time, so… Oh, so that huge explosion  came from you What about your opponent  Did you kill them She’s dead… I think What about you Uh, well… He disappeared after I  scolded him a little… Scolded him! That’s why you took so long! Taking your damn sweet time! Sorry, sir… Why’re you guys arguing  the minute you show up… Huh! This is none of your business! You’re right Fine Get it out of your system Hey! This wasn’t part of the deal! You said you’d free me  once I shut down my powers! Once we confirm that  everyone is free, we will Kuchiki and Kuchiki aren’t here Can you refer to them  by first names, sir You’re confusing us I’m losing feeling  in my arms and legs! Rukia! Look after her Yes, sir! Is she all right She’s alive Her wounds are slight, and there isn’t any irregularity  in her Spiritual Pressure However… there were no signs of  the enemy or its corpse in the area where Rukia collapsed You look like you know something Of course not I hardly know anything about  Riruka’s abilities… Neither of us wanted to show  the other our abilities I don’t know if she’s  dead, or if she got away, but I’d be grateful if she were dead Come on! Isn’t this enough! Melt this ice already! Not yet Why not! Oh, I can’t undo that one It’s the truth! Did you know Fullbringers and Substitute Soul  Reapers can trade their powers When we first joined Kugo,  we traded a portion of our powers with each  other as a sign of loyalty We also placed a small  restriction on those powers Here’s the restriction  I share between Kugo… “If Kugo is within the  range of my abilities, then I cannot undo them  unless he orders me to” That’s pretty good You put yourself at  quite a risk, though I had no such intention I suppose not You’re just fighting with  everything you’ve got, right So, what are you fighting for right now What do you mean Tsukishima’s dead Actually, he’s not dead yet, but his Spiritual  Pressure is nearly gone I’d say he only has about  ten minutes to live… And… when a Fullbringer dies, all traces  of his abilities disappear Understand what that means If Tsukishima dies, all of the memories of the past that he inserted will return to  what they used to be Your family and friends will all be just the way they were before So I’ll ask you once more: Right now, what are you fighting for No answer Then let me tell you one more thing It’s about the enemy you  should really be fighting They’ve stabilized… Yes Tessai, I’ll leave the rest to you Yes, I will see to them Where are you going To where everyone is To assist I’m coming with you No, most of the fighting  is probably over, so I’m going to provide healing You’ll be of no help,  Isshin, so stay here Shouldn’t we try to  wrap this up quickly by assisting Ichigo with his fight If we don’t do that, then… He’ll find out from Kugo Ginjo That’s fine He was going to find  out sooner or later The enemy I should really be fighting! Yeah Don’t mess with me! I’ve had enough of your mind games! That’s right You see yourself in at a disadvantage, so you present a shocking “fact” to lay on the psychological pressure in order to make your point that “You’d be better off  joining with me” Isn’t that right At a disadvantage, you say What ever makes you say that Sorry, but I can fully defeat  the both of you right now Why don’t you try shooting  at me from the back I’ll parry your shots while  keeping our conversation Kurosaki Do you know why you were  entrusted with a Combat Pass What do you mean When you were handed the Combat Pass, you must’ve been told  something like this: “If the Soul Reaper is deemed beneficial to the Soul Society, it is customary to give  them the Combat Pass” Listen closely, Kurosaki That’s a lie It’s no simple task for an  organization to determine whether  someone will be of benefit  or a detriment… And the biggest issue is that if they  “hand out Combat Passes  to those of benefit,” they’ve never told  Kurosaki what happens  to those who are not More correctly… Whether someone is of benefit or detriment to the Soul Society  has nothing to do with it Combat Passes are handed  out equally regardless The official name for Combat Pass is “Substitute Soul Reaper  Combat Pass”… It certifies that one has permission to conduct Substitute Soul Reaper  duties in the World of the Living I know that But have you ever, to this moment,  truly felt its authority I am Ichigo Kurosaki! I’m  a Substitute Soul Reaper!  Here’s my Combat Pass!  What the hell is that  I’ve never seen or  heard of such a thing  What’s with this thing  It isn’t any help at all…  Are you saying the Combat  Pass has another function Yeah The function of the Combat Pass is to keep watch and control Thanks to the Combat Pass, the Soul Society is able to keep constant tabs on your whereabouts, and allowed them to control  your Spiritual Pressure, at least while you had  the Combat Pass near you Didn’t you ever question… Why your Spiritual Pressure that rages out of control  when you’re agitated, even in Soul Reaper form,  never had any effect on you when you were in human form Why, when you used your Combat  Pass to produce your Fullbring, your Spiritual Pressure gushed  forth from the Combat Pass Why, during your Fullbring training, you heard your friends voices  via the Combat Pass Surely you must’ve  questioned them before The Combat Pass is a device that communicates  with the Soul Society, absorbing your Spiritual Pressure, then analyzing and controlling it You were given that so the Soul Society could keep watch on you and control you It’s not that you never  felt it was strange You simply pushed those questions  into the back of your mind People who you bonded with in battle would never do that to you You didn’t want to believe  they would do that to you Ichigo I will tell you The man who came up  with this plan is… Jushiro Ukitake… The Captain of Squad 13 The Combat Pass What’s that The Soul Society also has a law  covering the emergence of  a Substitute Soul Reaper It has been decided since  ancient times that if the Substitute Soul Reaper is  deemed beneficial to the Soul Society… then we are to give this to them  That one is yours now  I see…  Thank you, Ukitake  Ukitake did… We were tricked by the  most peace-loving man among the 13 Court Guard Squads! Ichigo! The man’s aim is to watch and control us in order to use us as pawns of the Soul Society, and to eliminate us if we resist! This is bad…!  Kurosaki! There’s no way Kurosaki can cope with these truths  in his present state! They all know! Everyone in the Soul Society  besides you knows this! They abandoned you and  left you to die, Ichigo! Don’t listen to him, Kurosaki! Shut the hell up! Bankai! Rukia! …Renji… You all right! Does it hurt anywhere! Yeah… Right now, my right shoulder hurts… Is Ichigo still inside… With this many captain-class  Soul Reapers present,  destroying that dimension  should be easy… I get it…  They’re waiting to see his decision What! What’s going on! Impossible…! It’s collapsing… Bankai “Shut the hell up” Shut up about what Do I annoy you so much that you’d do Bankai to kill  me at once to shut me up What would that do Would that hide your eyes  from reality once more Shut up That one was towards you But what I said earlier wasn’t… It was towards Ishida “Don’t listen to him,  Kurosaki!” my ass Shut up Mind your own business! Kurosaki… I also thought what Ukitake  said to me sounded odd… What! But I didn’t want to believe it I didn’t want to suspect Ukitake That’s why I always shoved those  thoughts to the back of my mind But then I realized something… I asked myself, “Why was  I suspicious of Ukitake” Ukitake is a lot smarter than me If he really was planning to deceive me, he would have done so in a way  that I wouldn’t notice But Ukitake handed me the Combat Pass along  with that explanation And I soon realized that the Combat Pass had no function I’m guessing that Ukitake purposely allowed me to realize that He purposely let me come to that realization and make my own choice Regarding what Coming to that realization didn’t leave you any  choice in the matter I did make a choice… I chose the path of protecting others I wanted power I wanted the power to protect all  sorts of people, all the time When I lost my powers, I  remembered that feeling Rukia gave me the power I  sought to protect people Everyone helped me regain  the powers I had lost That’s why I will protect  everyone and fight you There go the negotiations You leave me no choice! I didn’t want to have to kill you Bankai Oh yeah, I forgot about that… You were a Substitute Soul Reaper  yourself, weren’t you That’s right But there’s something else you forgot As I told you… People like us were attacked by Hollows before we were born Inside me… is the power of a Hollow Is that so Bring it on, Ginjo Let’s hurry up and settle this You talk big for a kid Time will try to constantly  try to catch up with you And with a roar, it will overcome you Do not look ahead Hope only lies within the unforeseeable current that will close in from behind Illustrated Guide to Soul Reapers Hey Long time no see It’s me, everyone’s idol, Kon! Since this is the last “Illustrated  Guide to Soul Reapers,” I’ll let you in on an interesting  story about myself! After Ichigo lost his powers,  these two were deeply troubled… “What could we do to help  him” they wondered This is what I told them: You guys need to have faith in Ichigo… Huh We’re done! Is this the end! I was coming to the best part! Why!"
" Brother, where are you going We’re returning to the Soul Society Huh Have you forgotten, Rukia We came to see the choice  Ichigo Kurosaki makes The Soul Society was aware that once the next Substitute  Soul Reaper appeared, Ginjo would set his sights  on him sooner or later When that happened, we would use that Substitute  to find Ginjo and before eliminating them  at an appropriate time The majority of captains  shared that view But our contact with that Substitute  changed the Soul Society We shared our powers with the Substitute we were supposed to kill and dispatched captains  to watch his actions rather than kill him Kuchiki Remember when you objected to the orders of keeping watch on Ichigo Kurosaki That can’t be! Ichigo wouldn’t… He would never succumb to the  temptations of the enemy! You were right Ichigo Kurosaki learned the  truth and made his choice That choice was the very same choice that the Ichigo Kurosaki we knew— the Ichigo Kurosaki you  believed in—made I’m glad the Substitute  Soul Reaper after Ginjo was a man like him That’s right He hasn’t changed since  the very beginning The one man’s unchanging will is what changed the Soul Society’s  million years of rigidity Ichigo! Why  I plan to crush the Soul  Reapers who betrayed me  And I expected you to argue  that that was wrong  Aren’t you even going to do that  Why won’t you  The look in your eyes  is that of someone trying  to understand me… Of someone trying to put himself in  my place and see things  from my perspective Are you telling me that you plan to understand me,  and still reject everything that I am… Ichigo! Ichigo…  Would our roles switch  if you were the one who  had appeared first Would you have become like me  Would we, Ichigo If you had come first… would we have been…  No! Riruka… Are you stupid You were really going for the kill! Out of my way! Don’t die! Don’t die, Ginjo! Ginjo! Face it! Face up to it already… We…couldn’t save Ginjo… Ginjo is the one who saved us… But the one who saved Ginjo… Is Ichigo Are you all by yourself  I see  Then we’re alike  Come with me  From today on, it’ll be the two of us  Why, Ginjo You taught me how to use my powers… You taught me how to fight… So why Why didn’t you teach me  what to do when you died! Shishigawara… Oh…I see… I get it… You have a bad habit of kicking things You have no business lecturing Riruka Jackie You’re alive That’s nice I may as well be dead Jackie, your Fullbring… Yeah I see That’s good, though You were the only one among us who truly  detested her abilities On my way here, I found Giriko’s watch and dead body, so  I buried them together I detested my abilities so much But now that I’ve lost them, I kind of envy Giriko for being  able to die with his powers Maybe it’s because  somewhere along the way, I realized that our Fullbrings were  all that connected us together… That sounds stupid I’m leaving Ichigo! Oh, you’ve come to I’m…alive… Yeah Mr Urahara came right after it happened But… Except for you, we couldn’t  find anyone else… I see Thank goodness…Riruka… You… When I heard they didn’t  find anyone, I… What After giving it a lot of  thought, I couldn’t…! In my mind, Mr Tsukishima,  you’re the strongest! You mustn’t die, Mr Tsukishima! You’re the strongest, Mr Tsukishima! You can’t die! You’re invincible, Mr Tsukishima! I see now, Ginjo…  I’m able to finally understand  now that you’re gone  Maybe you already knew  Thank you…Shishigawara  Wha-! What’re you saying! It’s only right that I  help you, Mr Tsukishima! After all, I am your apprentice! Oh! Mr Tsukishima, it’s morning! What a beautiful morning! -Thank you  It’s a sight for sore eyes! I wasn’t alone  Captain! Captain Ukitake! Reporting, sir! Ichigo Kurosaki has successfully defeated Kugo  Ginjo in the World of the Living! The captains dispatched to observe the battle have  also safely returned Retrieval of Kugo Ginjo’s  body is complete I see… Captain! I’m all right… What about Ichigo Sir, Ichigo Kurosaki is safe Thank goodness… Riruka, time for breakfast It’s got Tessai’s special pickles  that he makes only for guests Riruka I’m coming in Thank you, Ginjo,  for inviting me to join Xcution  Thank you, Chad,  for believing us  Thank you, Orihime, for  crying tears for me  And Ichigo…  I can say this with peace of mind…  Goodbye Forget me, okay Because I know that regardless  of how I say goodbye, I know you’ll never ever,  forget us  Reporting, sir Lieutenant Kuchiki of  Squad 13, who had been clearing up affairs in  the World of the Living, has just returned Why’re you reporting that to me Sir…because… What Huh Really Yes, sir Ichigo Kurosaki Understood What’d he come here  for all of a sudden Ichigo! Hey, Renji! How’re you doing Good… Hey, wait a minute! What brings you here! Well, you know… Rukia! What’s going on Why is he… He says he wants to speak directly with Head Captain Yamamoto What! He just received permission Hey, just a minute! What could it be about As a fellow Substitute Soul Reaper, he must have a lot on his mind… It wouldn’t be the least bit  strange if he were furious with us Do you mean he came to  return his Combat Pass Well, that I couldn’t say… It’s a sticky situation, though What’s this Are you guys all here to greet me Not everyone Kurotsuchi and Ukitake aren’t here Anyway, come inside The Old Man is waiting for you Kensei! You’re a captain now! Shut up! I said go on in I’m sure you didn’t  come here to chitchat Rukia, I think we should… Lieutenants Abarai and Kuchiki,  have a seat at the end Yes, sir Ichigo Kurosaki You fought admirably Oh, let’s forget about that I didn’t come here today  to be praised for my efforts Then what did you come for Yeah It’s about Ginjo’s body,  that you had Renji retrieve— I want to bring it back to the World of  the Living and give it a proper burial Ichigo…  Are you crazy Do you realize what you’re asking! Hirako! He’s right! The man is a heinous villain who  stole the powers of many Soul Reapers and murdered them one after another! How could you… That’s not what I meant! Listen, Ichigo… The guy messed up your  family and your friends Can you forgive a guy like that Or rather…should you Ichigo…  Asking to bury Ginjo is synonymous  with asking for his pardon…  That’s…  It’s not about forgiveness My family and friends are  back to the way they were I’m still alive And he’s… Just a Substitute Soul Reaper Ichigo Kurosaki Can I assume you’ve  said those words after considering all the ramifications Screw the ramifications! I simply want to do that for him as  a fellow Substitute Soul Reaper… Since I am going to continue to be one What! So that’s it I will grant your request Okay, then I’ll be going Oh, by the way… From now on, when a Soul Reaper  comes to Karakura Town, at least let them know that  this is a Combat Pass I knew I’d find you here Kyoraku Looks like Ichigo’s going back What about the Combat Pass… He says he’s taking it with him… Just to be sure, I asked him… He says he trusts us, so  he’ll hold on to it Oh… I see… He’s matured, hasn’t he Yeah We just didn’t realize that… We couldn’t help it When youngsters grow up, it happens so fast that we older people never see it coming Thank you… See you around, Rukia I wonder how many times  I’ve heard you say that This isn’t going to be the last time, so who cares how many times I say it You’re right Kurosaki! What took you, Kurosaki Big Brother! Yuzu, Brother Ichi is over there Hey, Ichigo! Welcome home!

The enemy is below us!, What Urahara Bey always does!, - How well do you know me! - Were falling!, - What happened - Its like I heard a voice, It cant be Except for the dead,  all those who stayed there are here, - Thats how it came to you - Its possible, It seems we go unnoticed, Is Dondoçakka among the prisoners, No, I dont feel spirit power Probably in another group, The reason they dont come back here is,  knowing that all the Hollows and Arrancars here are dead, - You dont see them - Its a scary sight, Unfortunately Its like no one is alive, I hadnt given in Thats their style, Look at this, This is the condensed soul particle flame they use, Thanks to this, the stone and sand of Hueco Mundo, which did not burn under normal conditions, burned, In the face of those who use a force we have never seen,  we were completely stunned, We had no choice but to flee, Then those who were just taken, They may want to use it as a vanguard, In the worst-case scenario, theyre just like the ones here, Understood Lets go save it, Hold on! There is no Dondochakka there!, So what We will save Dondochakka anyway, What difference does it make if we save a few Arrancars on the way, So Its true that youre right, Wait, dont go!, Look at this job The Arrancars he went to rescue,  is he not aware that he has an enemy until yesterday, - Exactly! - You both knew, That Ichigo is such a person, If you can solve this problem, if Ichigo solves it, you asked him for help without hesitation, Lets go too Sado!, - We Were coming too! - Yes!, Get in line! Get your back against the wall!, Hurry up!, Well drill you another hole or two!, Stern Ritter J, Looks like this guys head, Look, are we really going to do it I dont think we should, Stupid, theyre going to kill us anyway!, Yeah!, Silence please! Will you live or will you die, Well be holding a qualifier for the Hollows and Arrancars!, Ben, I will kill everyone one by one, starting from the right!, If anyone says I dont want to die, or if there is someone who says I want to join you,  beg as if he wanted to kneel and lick our shoes!, As long as you guys survive our attack,  you are the chosen ones who are lucky, smart and strong!, I beg you, do not waste this opportunity!, If youre going to spare my life, its solid—, Yes, of course its not that easy!, Those who will apply must take the entrance exam!, This elimination will determine the person who is entitled to take that exam, For those who dont understand my explanation,  like this, like this, Does the Commander have any thoughts on bringing Arrancar, There isnt any Hes not interested in Hueco Mundo anyway,  dies like this!, - My commander! - Your time to say commander is too slow, Very strange I thought we confiscated all your swords, Loly Aivirrne, aide-de-camp of our Lord Aizen!, Likewise Menoly Mallia!, We will not be defeated by servants like you!, - Do it - Yes, sir!, - Shall we kill - No, His Majesty has asked us to bring in the brave fools, These girls passed the exam Punish them so they dont die, However, I find it odd that Arrancars of this rank are adjutants, So the person called Aizen isnt very smart, Although, Tier Harribel, who took over the place after Aizens death, he couldnt fall in love with His Majesty, We shouldnt be surprised, Who did I tell you not to overdo it, May I ask who are you, Talk back and forth about our Lord Harribel, come get to know us!, I guess the butlers are not given much information!, You took Sir Harribel while we were gone, Dont get off your ass just because you beat those who call themselves Aizens squire!, Mila Rose, Sung-Sun, Apacci (Three Beast), What is this The war has already begun!, - Thats Tres Bestias soul power! - What are you looking for there, They take orders directly from His Holiness Harribel!, They are terribly powerful and frightening!, Moreover, they are always trying to take each others lives like cannibalistic monsters!, If those insanely powerful monsters are here,  get well soon to the enemy army!, - Theyre so scary, Ichigo! - I cant see ahead, stupid!, What, are you pulling me, Stupid, I didnt open my mouth!, Delete that snot also!, Extraordinary, You must not dive, I have a suggestion for you Surrender, Are you stupid, You are just empty talk!, If you surrender and join our army, you can work for Her Majesty with your only Tier Harribel, Not now or later,  you cant reach a greater happiness than this!, - What do you think were a Four-Eyed Monkey - Dont belittle us!, Oh, the negotiations failed, I am in great disappointment, 1st Company Barracks, Meeting Room, I have given you the detailed report on the infiltration of the rebel army, Thanks Akon You can withdraw, Yes, sir, Yes, this time its foreigners Which were nicknamed the rebel army for now, With the invasion of this rebel army that calls itself the Wandenreich, the disappearance of the Hollows in the living world,  interconnected, Destroying multiple Hollows in the world of the living,  caused serious imbalance of spirits, It is quite possible that the world of the living and the Soul Society will perish, destroying spirits, Intelligent commanders have already understood, Insurgent army, …consist of Quincys, The army is blowing their pipes, It sounds like shooting stars, The army stamps its feet Like thunder"
" N-No…, Thats impossible…, I cant believe the Tres Bestia, were defeated…, A Soul Reaper with an Arrancar, on his back, How unusual, That being said…, I know all about you,, Ichigo Kurosaki, The Daten that His Majesty gave us, included information about you, You were listed, as a Special Threat, that we should prioritize, dealing with!, Special Threat, That technique…, the Hirenkyaku, Are you guys really Qui--, Oh, my!, Dont tell me that you engaged us, without knowing who we were, Very well!, In that case…, I shall answer your question, Yes, we are who you think we are, We are Quincies, SQUAD ONE BARRACKS -, CAPTAINS MEETING ROOM, Quincies…, Well, I figured, that would be the case,, but this is quite the problem, Where is their base of operations, Unfortunately,, I have yet to find it…, I see…, That means we have no way, of attacking them, Im ordering all Squad Captains, to prepare for war, The advance guard of the rebel army, announced that the battle, would begin in five days,, but there is no reason to believe, the words of treacherous fellows, that would launch, a surprise attack, We must prepare for battle at once,, as fast as we possibly can!, We must not let them, get the upper hand again!, The blue skies above are hopelessly clear, At my wits end, I feel a growing frustration, As if to laugh at us hopeless cowards, Countless eyes stare at us, This soul of mine breaks again and again, All I can do is hold it tight, Until the day it turns to ash, Ive absorbed all of this sorrow, It has shaped me, painted me, But thats how we got here, right, One step at a time, just like breathing, These countless scars on my palm, That no longer fade, Are my badge, my story, I faced the fear and shred it to pieces, And let it walk beside me once more, BLEACH: THOUSAND-YEAR BLOOD WAR, All shots hit their mark, Whats the matter!, You can do better than this!, Thats weird…, I heard that Quincies, only use bows, What, Kurosaki!, Inoue!, Look after Nel!, Impressive…, It makes me dismayed, by my lack of skill…, Dont worry, Your arrows were a lot stronger, than Ishidas, Though its been quite some time, since I got hit with one of them, Ishida, By Ishida,, are you referring to Uryu Ishida, You guys know about Ishida, Uryu Ishidas Heilig Pfeil, is weaker than mine, How odd…, Thats not possible, What do you mean, Whoops, Speech is silver,, silence is golden, Ive said a little too much, Forgive me…, Now then, its time for me, to stop fooling around, I just received orders, from His Majesty, Just who is this Majesty, I have no need, to answer that question, In short, it means, you are going to die here, Now take a good look, Im sure youve heard, about this power…, A Quincys final state, Letz Stile!, The Quincy secret move, that Ishida used before!, Allow me to explain…, The proper name for this form is…, Quincy Voll Stern Dich, Weve received an update, from Jagd Armee 1, Quilge Opie is currently, engaged in battle, with Special Threat, Ichigo Kurosaki, Then lets go…, Where to, Your Majesty, Isnt it obvious, An imperial order from His Majesty, to the Stern Ritter, All Stern Ritter are to, immediately get equipped, and assemble at, the Gate of the Sun, Repeat…, All Stern Ritter are to…, The Wandenreich is going to…, invade the Soul Society, Do you feel it, The pulsation of my power…, The power of the one, who shall punish you!, Is that the same technique, that Urahara told me about, You seem confused, I know what youre thinking,, so I shall give you, a definitive answer, Its something entirely different, The Quincy Letz Stile that you know, is a relic of the past, that died out 200 years ago, due to its fragile nature, The only one who was attached to it, was Soken Ishida,, who rejected our research, and evolution!, By comparison,, this Quincy Voll Stern Dich…, the difference in power is, as far apart as heaven and earth!, I see…, I dont know about your history,, but in short,, its different from Ishidas power, Im glad to hear that, If Ishida transformed into, something as creepy as that…, I might cut him down by mistake, Youre easing up on your blade, Getsugatensho!, Thats not good, You should aim your strikes, Damn it!, That said, even if you did that,, you wouldnt find any weaknesses!, You called this form of mine, creepy, didnt you, That is the correct response, To the eyes of you, atrocious Soul Reapers,, the form of we holy executioners…, should be creepy and horrifying, to behold!, No way!, Sotenkishun is being peeled away!, Now have a taste…, of my Voll Stern Dich,, the power of Piskiel!, What…!, What is that monster, You assumed, we couldnt fight anymore,, so you let down your guard,, didnt you, I thought we told you that, you shouldnt underestimate us…, Show this cocky four-eyed monkey, your power!, Ayon!, What the hell…, is that thing!, Ayon is a monster created through, the fusion of our left arms!, Hes got power,, but hes unpredictable!, A monster like you could never, beat my Voll Stern Dich--!, ISHIDA RESIDENCE - ARCHIVES, Theres nothing of importance here…, What are you doing, Ryuken!, I thought I told you, not to come in here, without my permission, The Soul Society and Hueco Mundo, are being invaded by someone, And they are most likely…Quincies, There shouldnt be any Quincies, in existence aside from us, Do you know something about this!, This has nothing to do with you, - Get out, - Are you going to avoid me again!, I am the last Quincy, I have a right to know, whats going on, The answer you seek…, cannot be found here, SHORYU GATE ENTRANCE, Shino, I know this probably isnt, the best time to ask this, but…, What is it, Do you happen to know why, Soul Reapers and Quincies, are at odds with each other, in the first place, We both share the same goal, of defeating Hollows, dont we, What!, Thats because…, Wait…, Why is that, You know that in ancient times,, Soul Reapers were referred to, as Balancers, dont you, S…, SQUAD 13 SIXTH SEAT -, HIDETOMO KAJOMARU, Sixth Seat Kajomaru!, Its an honor to see you here!, Well, the alarms, havent sounded yet,, so why dont we discuss this a bit, For starters,, you understand the law of, this world where souls circulate, between the World of the Living, and the Soul Society, dont you, - Yes, - Of course!, Good, However, souls that become Hollows, in the World of the Living, cannot return to the Soul Society, By purifying Hollows and delivering, their souls to the Soul Society,, they are led back to, the normal circulation of souls, This is the job of Soul Reapers, and the reason why, we are called Balancers, However, Quincies destroy, and completely extinguish, souls that have become Hollows, What happens when they do that, The souls are unable to return, to the Soul Society, Thats right, Normally,, a balance must be maintained, between the number of souls, that exist in the Soul Society, and the World of the Living, As Quincies extinguish more Hollows, in the World of the Living,, the number of souls is diminished,, disrupting that natural balance…, If we allow this to happen,, the balance of souls, will eventually be ruined,, causing the Soul Society to flow, into the World of the Living…, ending in the simultaneous, destruction of both worlds, There isnt much written, about Quincies to begin with…, Master…, Cannot be found here…, ISHIDA RESIDENCE -, RYUKEN ISHIDAS ROOM, This is Masters--!, To prevent this destruction,, the Soul Society had repeatedly, approached the Quincies, for a dialogue,, but they were turned away, each time, The world was steadily, heading toward destruction, And after endless debate, within the Soul Society…, the Quincy Extermination Operation, was finally carried out, 200 years ago, Our goals do not mesh, and the grudge borne of, their genocide will never perish, The Soul Reapers and Quincies, have no other choice but to fight…, Do you understand,, Squad Member Ryunosuke Yuki, May I…ask one question, Are we Soul Reapers, fighting this battle for justice, If there is justice, on one side or the other,, it would be called self-defense, or conquest, However, this is a war, Wars take place…, because both sides are just, You know why Ive called you here,, dont you,, SQUAD 1 BARRACKS -, HEAD CAPTAINS OFFICE, Squad 12 Captain Kurotsuchi, Is this about mobilizing, members of Squad 12, to expunge 28,000 citizens, of the Rukon District, without permission in order to, correct the balance of souls, Why didnt you get permission, Those mass disappearances, in the Rukon District, reported by Squad 11s, Third Seat Ikkaku Madarame, and Fifth Seat Yumichika Ayasegawa…, You would have gotten permission, if things became dire, The mass extermination of Hollows, in the World of the Living, by the rebel army was intentionally, done to disrupt the balance, between the World of the Living, and the Soul Society, If you consider the fact that, the lives of the people, of the Rukon District stopped, the collapse of both worlds,, it is not that big of a loss, If I had waited for permission, and the situation had escalated, beyond control,, that is not something, I could take responsibility for, But if your Department of, Research and Development, had reported the matter, and promptly dealt with it,, we might have prevented, the current situation, Youre wrong about that, The moment that the Quincy, known as Uryu Ishida, infiltrated the Soul Society, as a Ryoka,, I had already foreseen this would, happen and had given my advice, You are the one who chose, to needlessly disregard my words, Everything that is happening now, stems from the fact that, you, Head Captain,, couldnt kill that man, 1,000 years ago!, Oh, dear, But man, this guys tough, I cant believe, hes still in one piece, after that beating, he took from Ayon--, Impressive…, The report did not indicate, this kind of power…, I must advise His Majesty, to adjust the strength of our Blut, But before I do that…, Each and every one of you…, will die here immediately, Not again!, Actually…, Wait, Ayon!, Stop!, Perhaps I should say,, you will live here, Sklave Rai, A Quincys basic ability, to focus Reishi, When taken to its highest limits,, it becomes the absolute, subordination of Reishi, If possible,, I didnt want to use it…, because my holy wings would be, tarnished by such wicked beings, A wise decision, However,, youve neglected to take, the difference in our power, into consideration, Inoue!, Sado!, Whenever I see such a struggle,, it reaffirms my beliefs, Is the sight of the weak dying, always so unsightly, I cannot stand to watch this, Die, A Bankai…!, If I destroy the disk on your head…, you cant use that absolute, subordination of Reishi anymore,, can you!, Figuring that out is one thing, But to actually go for it, takes courage…!, You really are…, difficult to deal with,, arent you!, Hurry!, Hurry it up!, Oh, come on,, what are you talking about!, Youre the one who said,, We should save Dondochakka, while Ichigo Kurosaki is, distracting the enemy!, That was a close one!, I didnt think we would have to, go through this much trouble!, Not only are you heavy, but you chose to hide in the sand!, That hurts!, Dont enter without my permission, This is the second time, Whats the meaning of this, Are the things written here true, I guess that means, you know everything…, About the Wandenreich…, About the guy, referred to as His Majesty…, And even about Mom…!, Uryu…, This has nothing to do with you, Theres no need to be so tense, Sixth Seat Kajomaru…, Squad 11 is standing by,

without form or expression, We lie buried as we glare, into the distance, I cant hear anything, I cant seem to cut anything, It feels like Im sinking, Falling, falling, Touching, Eyes struck wide open, Something no one has ever seen, The furthest reaches are now visible to us, It cannot be undone, and cannot be stopped, This ensuing struggle, Whisk it away beyond, the ends of the earth, Along with our breaths, Take everything, Whisk it away beyond, the ends of the earth, Along with our futures, Along with our world, Something no one has ever seen, The furthest reaches are now, visible to

I object to everything, – The second one, – about you, Kenpachi Zaraki!, – got on my nerves talking about, – Anyone that I object to will be—, – objecting to everything about me, So I tore out his throat, The third guy wasnt too bad, He transformed into me, after all, I struggled a bit, because I was fighting myself, But that just meant I had to become, stronger than his impression of me, I heard you were a monster, but now I understand, Ive got no business with, a scrawny pale guy like you, I came here, to fight you!, Your Majesty!, GENJI-JUKU, Rukia, Damn it!, Damn it!, Break!, Break,

Master Eijisai Yamamoto!, FOUNDER OF GENRYU STYLE / GENJI-JUKU, GRAND MASTER SHIGEKUNI YAMAMOTO, Hey!, Dont call me Eijisai!, F-Forgive me, sir!, For some reason, each time, I distinguished myself in battle,, the name Eijisai, became more widely used, I didnt care much for that, But, Master Eijisai,, I cannot be so audacious, as to call you by your real name!, What is with you, anyway!, Youre not even one of my students,, and yet,, you hang around here every day!, I come here hoping to be, your right-hand man!, In that case, all the more reason, for you to become my student!, If you rise to the rank of master,, youll naturally become, my right-hand man!, No, Master Eijisai,, if I become your student,, then I will only be mimicking you, A right-hand man must be one, who can compensate, for the things you are, unable to handle!, Youre always splitting hairs, Also, I havent shown up every day, This is my first time here, in a month, As you told me to a month ago,, I have acquired a Bankai, Oh, In that case, try to defeat me, with that Bankai of yours, RUKON DISTRICT –, EAST 37 DISTRICT, RYUGON, Bankai!, Koko Gonryo Rikyu!, It was a magnificent Bankai, He wasnt able to defeat me, but, His Bankai left a permanent scar, on my forehead, That Bankai is like a newborn, Thats right, I intend to spend the rest of, my life honing this Bankai, so it can be helpful to you,, Master Eijisai!, His words contained no lies, After years of grueling training,, everybody in the Soul Society, came to know Chojiros name, When my scar dried, it looked like, the Japanese character Ju,, so everyone started, calling me Jujisai, I cannot allow the scar I gave you, to be a reason to change your name,, Master Eijisai, Everyone except Chojiro, He stubbornly continued to, call me Eijisai, RYU (WILLOW), So for Chojiros sake,, I took on the name Genryusai, GENRYUSAI, Head Captain!, Hey!, Whats the matter, old man!, Have you lost the strength, to even retaliate, after getting hit by, your subordinates Bankai!, Come on, say something!, Chojiro, I can feel your frustration, I understand your anger very well, Because I know, the Bankai that you had honed, is absolutely not this weak!, Burn, Im finally able to give you, a proper send-off, Chojiro, Farewell, Do not worry, Every last member, of the rebel army, I will slaughter them, with my own hand, The Head Captain, The Head Captain is furious!, Ive never felt the Head Captain, get this angry before, You idiot, Neither have I, That includes him, fighting on the front lines, Look at how hard, the Head Captain is fighting, We

that would be, an unacceptable disgrace!, – Sir!, – Yes, sir!, Whoa, wait a minute, You guys were as good as dead, a second ago, Whats going on here, This is a real problem, isnt it, Old Man Yamas Spiritual Pressure, is reverberating throughout, the Seireitei, Its giving me goosebumps, Like hes scolding me, As if hes saying, I dont remember, raising you to be a coward, Whod struggle against, an enemy of this level!, Everything we had left behind, Our breaths blending as mist, without form or expression, We lie buried as we glare, into the distance, I cant hear anything, I cant seem to cut

best you can do, How frail, It seems Ive overestimated, you people, Go to sleep, Its been a thousand years,, hasnt it, Yhwach, Ive come to put an end, to your life, The heart burns, Even though the rain falls,"
" THE QUINCY EXTERMINATION OPERATION, FROM 1,000 YEARS AGO, It wasnt 200 years ago, Whats this, The blue skies above are hopelessly clear, At my wits end, I feel a growing frustration, As if to laugh at us hopeless cowards, Countless eyes stare at us, This soul of mine breaks again and again, All I can do is hold it tight, Until the day it turns to ash, Ive absorbed all of this sorrow, It has shaped me, painted me, But thats how we got here, right, One step at a time, just like breathing, These countless scars on my palm, That no longer fade, Are my badge, my story, I faced the fear and shred it to pieces, And let it walk beside me once more, BLEACH: THOUSAND-YEAR BLOOD WAR, Its been a thousand years,, hasnt it, Yhwach, Ive come to put an end, to your life, Good indeed, Its always nice to see, ones spirits lifted, That is for certain, But you people, have misjudged one thing, Your boss will lose to our boss, Because its not just you people, whose spirits are lifted, from knowing that, our bosses are fighting!, Die, old man!, Youre right, Someone misjudged, Your conventions, dont apply to Old Man Yama, Fools!, Thats what they get, for interfering in my battle, What You look like, you want to say something—, Your Majesty!, You havent changed, Yhwach, But know that your habit of, selling your subordinates short, will end here, Youve grown old,, Shigekuni Yamamoto, However, seeing you let your rage, take over like that, reminds me of when, you were younger, Nonsense!, Youve finally drawn it, You talk as if youve been, waiting for me to draw my sword, Do you know why I was waiting, Your flesh, blood, sword, and soul, I intend to crush you, until theres nothing left!, My throat feels dry, My lips cracked open, Captain Unohana, Does your skin feel kind of dry, all of a sudden, Oh my, Isane, How cute of you, to worry about your skin, N-No, thats not what I meant!, Please settle this quickly, before your power itself, destroys the Soul Society, You cant use Hyorinmaru anymore, Youve noticed, havent you, Every drop of water, in the Soul Society, is quietly evaporating, little by little, Theres no mistake, This is, Bankai, Zanka no Tachi!, Bankai, That scorched little sword, is his Bankai, Dont underestimate it, Zanka no Tachi is a Bankai, that seals all of his flames, within that single blade, One swing and its all over, Everything it cuts is burnt by an explosive flame, It is a sword of hellfire, Thats right, Youve seen this Bankai, a thousand years ago, havent you, But are you sure about that, Feel for yourself, whether its still the same, as a thousand years ago, He cut me!, But where are the flames, Is his Bankai really different, from the way it was, a thousand years ago, Flames are his Bankais power, Theres no mistake about that, Then, where did all that flame, disappear to!, The tip of his sword!, Correct!, Zanka no Tachi, East!, Kyokujitsujin!, Ive focused, all the heat of my flames, into just the tip of my blade, It does not burn,, nor does it emit an explosive flame, It merely blows away everything, it touches without a trace, All it means is that, I just have to cut you down, without letting, your sword touch me!, What, A thousand years ago,, all of you died, Today,, I will force you to remember, that all of you are nothing, but a horde of corpses, just waiting to be burned!, These flames, I just told you about, my Zanka no Tachi, East, If there is an East,, there is also a West, Zanka no Tachi, West, Zanjitsu Gokui!, Its heat, is 15 million degrees Celsius, You can no longer touch me now, When I use my Bankai,, think of my body and blade, as being enveloped by the sun, Flames, 15 million degrees Celsius, Theres no way such immense heat, would be visible as flames, Is this an illusion, Wait, Perhaps his Spiritual Pressure, is so overwhelmingly powerful, that it looks like flames, as it bursts out of him, Shigekuni Yamamoto!, Now then, Im ending this, Yhwach, If I dont end this soon, you, and I, as well as the Soul Society,, will burn to ashes, A thousand years ago,, the Quincy empire, known as the Licht Reich, intended to annihilate, all Hollows, They invaded the Soul Society,, who had opposed them,, but were wiped out by, the Thirteen Court Guard Squads, Then 200 years ago, The Soul Reapers, unilaterally decided to, exterminate, the surviving Quincies,, believing that they would disrupt, the circulation of souls, I guess this means that, no matter how much we try,, Quincies and Soul Reapers, will never get along, The Soul Society isnt involved,, but Im still a Soul Reaper!, No, Youre a Substitute Soul Reaper, Furthermore, the Soul Society, has abandoned you, Im a Quincy, I cannot help Hollows or Arrancars, I know, Quincies exist, to destroy Hollows, right, Kurosaki, It feels like Im burning, My eyes, my hair, my throat, If it werent for Blut,, I probably would have turned, into ashes even at this distance, Whats the matter, Are you just going to watch, Wait, that question, was a bit spiteful, Your sword is broken, and theres nothing you can do, I dont blame you, for not being able to move, You can run if youd like, Except Ill quickly catch up, and kill you!, Of course, Your sword is broken, All you have left are your arrows, Now then, Shall we, Kirchenlied, Sankt Zwinger!, This is a Quincys, ultimate defensive incantation, that combines offense and defense!, Step into this and you will be, torn apart by Gods light!, I told you, you cannot harm me!, The dead, The ashes of those who perished, by my flame, Give me a hand, And I will give you, a moments joy of battle, Zanka no Tachi, South, Kakajumanokushidaisojin!, What is this, What in the world is this!, Kakajumanokushidaisojin, I awaken those I have slain by, heating their ashes with my blade, These awakened dead become my limbs, and chase down those I deem to be, enemies until they turn into dust!, How laughable that, the head of the Soul Reapers, would awaken the dead!, You dont deserve to be called, a Soul Reaper, Shigekuni Yamamoto!, Dont think you can stop me, with something like this!, Your mouth works well,, but your eyes dont work at all, Seydlitz!, Argola!, Hubert!, Do you see the subordinates, that you mercilessly killed, Shigekuni Yamamoto, you bastard!, Are you regretting not stealing, my Bankai earlier, No, thats not it, Its not that you decided, not to steal my Bankai, You couldnt, You people steal Bankai by learning, its power and understanding it, Am I wrong, I havent shown my true power, even a thousand years ago, You cannot steal what is, beyond your understanding, Its as simple as that, Wait!, Where are you going!, Dont make a fuss, If you want to kill me,, then come after me, After you defeat your subordinates, who stand before you, that is, You bastard, It seems that even you still had, a shred of humanity left, Dont talk as if you know me!, I thought I told you, dont assume you can stop me, with the likes of this!, I can see your tears, Yhwach, Painful, isnt it, To have to destroy the corpses, of your subordinates, just to reach me, You must hate me, dont you, For using such a dirty tactic as, bringing your dead subordinates, back to the battlefield, But none of what, youre experiencing, could compare to, the hatred and suffering, of the Soul Reapers, that you have killed!, Zanka no Tachi, North, Tenchi Kaijin!, I-I wasnt strong enough, Please forgive me, Wait, who would the boss, be apologizing to, This war was started by you, And youve lost, Who are you apologizing to, I wasnt able to, carry out your orders, Who in the world are you!, Your Majesty Yhwach!, The Squad 1 Barracks!, Okikiba!, Damn you, Yhwach, Stern Ritter Y, The Yourself, The R of Royd Loyd, You made sure that no one noticed, I wasnt present, Well done, You, said I did well, W-What an honor to—, You bastard, What have you been up to until now, Whats beneath, the Squad 1 Barracks, The Central Underground, Great Prison!, I went and met with Sosuke Aizen, THE CENTRAL UNDERGROUND, GREAT PRISON, Yhwach, huh, I have many ways of, finding out your name, Though I didnt think I would, get to see you with my own eyes, I wont ask why youre here, The unpleasant Spiritual Pressure, swirling on the surface above, is enough to tell me, what is happening, In that case,, this simplifies things, One of the Special Threats,, Sosuke Aizen, come under my command, The Quincy King is welcoming me, into the Wandenreich, We share the same path—, the goal of destroying, the Soul Society, dont we, The same path, huh, I refuse, What, I cannot stand to see, the Quincy King, following in the footsteps, of a Soul Reaper, Is that your answer, Were done talking here, Are you leaving already, You came here because you saw, my power as a threat, didnt you, Thats right, But since you are fused, with the Hogyoku,, it would take too long to kill you, or take you with us, to restrain you, A wise decision, It is best to minimize the time, we spend sharing the same path, Especially when, dealing with someone, who should eventually, be eliminated, Now then, I see youve exhausted your powers, in your battle with my impostor, Havent you, Shigekuni Yamamoto, Shut up!, Bankai!, Its not that we couldnt steal, your Bankai, But your power is so strong that, no one other than I can handle it, Therefore, I ordered Royd, to leave it alone until I returned, So what now, I can use the power of this Bankai, to awaken the corpses, of your subordinates,, Genryusai Yamamoto, You bastard!, Farewell, Shigekuni Yamamoto, Everything we had left behind, Our breaths blending as mist, without form or expression, We lie buried as we glare, into the distance, I cant hear anything, I cant seem to cut anything, It feels like Im sinking, Falling, falling, Touching, Eyes struck wide open, Something no one has ever seen, The furthest reaches are now visible to us, It cannot be undone, and cannot be stopped, This ensuing struggle, Whisk it away beyond, the ends of the earth, Along with our breaths, Take everything, Whisk it away beyond, the ends of the earth, Along with our futures, Along with our world, Something no one has ever seen, The furthest

I removed you, from being counted as, one of the five Special Threats, Why didnt you restore, your left arm, You couldve done so if youd, ordered that human girl to, I know why, You didnt want to exploit humans, I know all about it, Even during your battle with Aizen,, you were apprehensive about, getting Ichigo Kurosaki involved, because he was a human, And even now, you stood before me, trying to carry the burden of, the Soul Society and the World, of the Living on your shoulders, and you lost, Youve grown weak,, Shigekuni Yamamoto, You used to be different, The original Thirteen

" It happened again!, I blacked out again, How many times was that, I black out amid battle,, again and again, only to find myself, back where I left off, This brings back memories, I always enjoy my battles,, but not to the point, where Id lose myself, or have blackouts, in the middle of it, That happened only once, That day I fought you, The blue skies above are hopelessly clear, At my wits end, I feel a growing frustration, As if to laugh at us hopeless cowards, Countless eyes stare at us, This soul of mine breaks again and again, All I can do is hold it tight, Until the day it turns to ash, Ive absorbed all of this sorrow, It has shaped me, painted me, But thats how we got here, right, One step at a time, just like breathing, These countless scars on my palm, That no longer fade, Are my badge, my story, I faced the fear and shred it to pieces, And let it walk beside me once more, BLEACH: THOUSAND-YEAR BLOOD WAR, RUKON DISTRICT -, SEVERAL HUNDRED YEARS AGO, Captain!, Its just not possible, No matter how much we search, the Rukon District, I doubt well find anyone, strong enough to satisfy you, Im impressed you figured out, my true intent, Cutting down gangs from, the Rukon District wont, make much difference in preserving, the peace in the Seireitei, The size of this pile of bodies is, the size of your dissatisfaction!, That pile, How long has it been there, Huh, This wasnt your doing, Whos that kid, I was bored, With the sword, With fighting, And so I wandered around, in search of a foe, who could please my sword, Thats probably why our swords, drew us two weary souls together, Such bliss, I hadnt expected this, I never would have thought that, I could experience, such unparalleled joy, by crossing blades with a child, But I never thought, that child would place shackles, on himself because of our battle, I landed one!, Before, I could only react, But now, I can counter it, Its almost as if each time, I experience a blackout, I wake up feeling reborn!, Kenpachi Zaraki, you probably, have not realized this, That you are unconsciously, restraining your powers, while in battle, Do you know why you narrowly lost, your battle with Ichigo Kurosaki, Do you know why you narrowly won, your battle with Nnoitora Gilga, Was it because they were strong, Im sure thats how it seemed, to the others, But I knew that wasnt the case, In each instance, you suppressed, your power to the limit, During that battle, we both, experienced unparalleled joy, The only difference was that, you learned the joy, of fighting on the edge, That is my sin, You must have been ecstatic, Everyone around you was weak, You had no enemies, you could test your sword against, I was the first foe you encountered, who could rival your power, However, I was weaker than you, I was the first person in your life, you could call a foe, You believed that if you lost me,, you would never experience, the joy of battle ever again, You wanted to bring yourself, down to my level,, so little by little,, you unconsciously, began to suppress your power, into a deep, dark place, I was devastated, My weakness drove you, to suppress your power, But one day, I noticed something, Each time you flirt with death, against a powerful foe,, you start to break your shackles, and return to the person, you used to be, I am strong, Stronger than anyone besides you, That is why I will kill you, Even if it takes a hundred, or a thousand tries, That is why I will heal you, Again and again, Until you return, to what you really are, From there, you will surpass me, and reach

only be one Kenpachi, That is the rule, as well as an inevitable fate, Because when the strong, find the next strongest,, they can no longer swing, their sword for their own sake, The tip of their sword, will always be pointed, either toward, killing the next strongest, or toward nurturing them, The tip of my sword is, Hes the one, This child is the one to be worthy, of the name Kenpachi,

Masaki was, - I-Its all right, Ryu!, Ill be, Miss Masaki, Masaki!, Whats wrong!, Are you in pain, No!, Is that a Hollows hole, What do you think youre doing,, Ryuken, Wheres Father!, Were trying to get in touch, with him right now, You will wait here, Wait!, You cant be with that thing!, Youll put yourself in danger!, Come back!, Please, Come back, Ryuken!, What is this thing, that resembles a Hollows hole, Why is she in so much pain, Whats happening to Masaki, Why didnt I stop her by force, Why didnt I do everything I could, to interrupt that battle, Why!, Whew, that was a close one!, It almost got you!, Its you!, Whats wrong, Wait, let me take a look at her!, Dont touch her!, Why do you think, this is happening to her, Its because she protected you!, She broke the rules of the Quincies, to protect you, a Soul Reaper, And because of that,, she was wounded, Why does Masaki, have to go through this!, That wound is whats causing this, I cant think of, any other explanation, Ill never forgive you for, Lets stop right there, Theres no time to argue, Please come with me, both of you, Ill tell you the choices, you have to save her, Im falling, Falling down a peaceful hole, Its quiet, dark and lonely, Yet, Im not scared, I have this feeling, that someone who needs me, is waiting for me down there, Whos there, URAHARAS SHOP, Ive been researching the same, symptom that she is exhibiting, Ive been researching the same, symptom that she is exhibiting, for close to a hundred years, A hundred years!, Just who are you anyway, My name is Kisuke Urahara, I was banished, from the Soul Society, Youre Kisuke Urahara, I dont care who you are!, Hurry up and restore Masaki, back to normal!, I never said anything about, restoring her back to normal, What, Ill give it to you straight, That young lady, Masaki can never go back, to the way she used to be, Her condition, is known as Hollowfication, Hollowfication is what happens, when a Hollows soul, is poured into another soul,, destroying the boundaries, between the two souls, It is the result of an attempt to, sublimate a soul to a higher level, Originally, it was meant to, strengthen a Soul Reapers soul, However,, souls that undergo Hollowfication, eventually become, mindless monsters,, and ultimately self-destruct, against their will, a process known as Soul Suicide, Hollowfication is, an uncontrollable technology, Uncontrollable!, Doesnt that mean theres no way, to save Masaki, I cant return her, to the way she was,, but I can save her life, During my research, over the past hundred years,, I discovered a way to prevent, this Soul Suicide, It involves injecting something, into the victims soul, that can counteract Hollowfication, This allows the soul, to maintain balance, so that their boundaries, wont get destroyed, Thus, preventing a Soul Suicide, Let me give you a specific example, If we inject, a Hollowfied Soul Reaper, with a vaccine made from a Quincys, light arrow and a human soul,, theyll remain in, whatever state theyre in, However, Quincies have, no resistance against Hollows,, so the vaccine isnt enough, I dont understand what you mean, To put it in simpler terms,, were trying to neutralize it, by hitting it, with a counteracting force, To save this Quincy girls life,, prevent her Hollowfication, while retaining, her existence as a human, we need a stronger, counteracting force, Something that must, remain by her side, at all times until she dies, A powerful counteracting force, that continues to suppress, her Hollowfication, Youre lying!, There must be some other way!, Youre quite sharp, You quickly figured it out, However, you have no choice in this matter, The one with a choice, is you, Isshin Shiba, Soul Reapers are, the opposites of Quincies, Humans are the opposites, of Hollows, Currently, Masaki is a hybrid, of a Quincy and a Hollow, To counteract that, we need, someone who is a hybrid, of Soul Reaper and human, This is a special Gigai I created, It was created from a human soul, It envelops the soul, that enters it,, making them completely human, You understand now, dont you, If you use this, youll become, a hybrid of Soul Reaper and human, Which means you can, become her opposite, This is the choice, Im presenting to you, However, this choice has, far too many downsides for you, I must bind your soul, to Masakis soul, and the Hollow within her, with a string of Reishi, For as long as Masaki lives, No, It will be forever passed down, to her descendants, While you are in this Gigai,, not only will you be unable to, use your Soul Reaper powers,, but you wont even, be able to see Hollows, And its likely that, once you get in, youll never return to being, a Soul Reaper ever again, This has only downsides for him!, Theres no way he would accept, something like this!, Hed never—, Okay, Ill do it!, - What!, - I said Ill do it!, Hurry up!, Man, you talk too much!, I have to quit being a Soul Reaper, and protect her, for the rest of her life, right!, Of course, Ill do it!, Youre okay with giving up, your current life, Are you kidding me, Hell no!, But so what!, If I let the person, who saved my life die, because I couldnt make a decision, I know my future self, will laugh at me!, Very well, I shall begin the procedure, Yo, Im here to protect you, Hey, Hollow!, Now that Im here,, I wont let you, lay a finger on her!, Getsuga Tensho!, Ive successfully, connected your souls, Shell be all right now, I see, Thank goodness, Youre that Soul Reaper, from the other day, Please tell me your name!, Thank goodness, Did you leave Miss Masaki behind, with the Soul Reaper, I did, Go home and tell my mother, that Ryuken is unqualified, to protect the Quincies, - No Im not leaving, - I said go home, No, I will not leave you here, by yourself, Young Master, - Katagiri!, - Master Ryuken, Have you forgotten, It is my duty to devote, my entire life to serving you, From the day I first met you,, my life has belonged to you, So please, Please do not be sad, When you are sad,, it tears my heart apart, When you cry, Katagiri, Thats enough, Lets go home, Yes, understood, Young Master, After that,, soon after graduating high school,, Masaki left the Ishida family, Her soul was mixed with a Hollow, For the Quincies,, it was the proper decision, KUROSAKI CLINIC As for me,, I made use of the medical skills, I learned at the Academy, and opened up a small clinic, There were a ton of things, I had to learn,, but with Uraharas help,, I somehow managed, When Masaki became, a college student,, she would often come by, to make fun of my white coat, I told Masaki that I lost, my Soul Reaper powers, because I was banished from, the Soul Society for screwing up, She probably saw through my lies, from the moment I told her that, I was terrible at lying, and her intuition, was incredibly sharp, So lying to her felt trivial, and meaningless, She would always, see through my lies, and forgive me for telling them, In a movie we saw together,, an old man compared the old woman, he spent many years with, to the sun, I dont remember, the rest of the movie, aside from the fact that, it made Masaki burst into tears,, but that one line stuck with me, Masaki was like the sun, She attracted everything,, forgave everything,, illuminated everything,, and spun everything around, I was just, happy to be spun around by her, And then, you were born, You already know the rest, By coming into contact with Rukia,, you gained your Soul Reaper powers, By training with Urahara,, you gained your Zanpakuto, And through your battles, in the Soul Society,, the Hollow in you was awakened, The fact that it was released, means that my Soul Pressure, was no longer able to suppress him, And so, my connection to my Gigai, and that Hollow was broken, Thats how I regained, my Soul Reaper powers, for the first time in 20 years, I probably dont need to explain, the things you already experienced, But, there is still one thing, that youve experienced, that you dont know, the whole story about, Nine years ago from today, June 17th, The day your mom died, You need to know, the real reason, your mom died that day, Everything we had left behind, Our breaths blending as mist, without form or expression, We lie buried as we glare, into the distance, I cant hear anything, I cant seem to cut anything, It feels like Im sinking, Falling, falling, Touching, Eyes struck wide open, Something no one has ever seen, The furthest reaches are now visible to us, It cannot be undone, and cannot be stopped, This ensuing struggle, Whisk it away beyond, the ends of the earth, Along with our breaths, Take everything, Whisk it away beyond, the ends of the earth, Along with our futures, Along with our world, Something no one has ever seen, The furthest reaches are now, visible to us, Dont you know Gods demand, Dont you know Gods demand, As we tear each other down, Your mom, She wasnt supposed to, die that day, What do you mean, Your mom, Masaki, Even though she had merged, with a Hollow,, she was originally an Echt Quincy, Her defensive ability,, the Blut Vene,, was exceptionally powerful, Not only could she defeat, Grand Fisher,, but she could have done it without, getting a single scratch on her, However, That didnt happen, Why not, Its because she lost, her Quincy powers that day, But how!, What happened nine years ago!, Auswählen, AUSWÄHLEN, Its a Quincy selection process, conducted by Yhwach himself, I heard of a Quincy tale, that sang praises of a king, who was sealed away, According to that,, The confined Quincy King, regains his pulse after 900 years, His mind after 90 years, His strength after 9 years, Yhwach robbed Quincies, he deemed impure of their powers, and made them his own, As a result, Uryus frail mother,, Kanae Katagiri, lost her life, And how Masaki lost her powers, and lost her life in battle, How, How is he able to do that, Is it because hes their king, Who is Yhwach anyway!, Yhwach is the Father, of the Quincies, The Quincies started from him, And all Quincies have his blood, running in their veins, The memories within, your Spiritual Pressure, have awakened too soon, It is unable to contain Quincies!, You dont know anything, about yourself, do you, Not even about your own mother, Farewell, Ichigo Kurosaki, my son born in the dark, Dad, Thanks, No problem, Hey, Ichigo, You forgot this, I came to deliver it to you, Thanks, Ms Ikumi, Dad, Im going, I believe the world, is full of danger, I want to protect you from it, Only because inside me is, the same impulse as that danger,"
