1
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:18,643
It's Asguiaro Ebern.

2
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,103
Getsuga...

3
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:23,023
tensho!

4
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:27,152
Why won't his Bankai disappear?!

5
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,363
Help us... Ichigo...

6
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:32,115
It's Hueco Mundo...

7
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:33,783
Hueco Mundo is--!

8
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:35,994
Quiet, please!

9
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:38,288
Will you live or will you die?!

10
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:41,499
We'll be having
a selection competition

11
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:43,835
for the Hollows and Arrancar!

12
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:46,004
You dare to speak poorly
of Master Halibel,

13
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:48,715
and yet don't know who we are?!

14
00:00:58,349 --> 00:00:59,726
Are you guys really Qu--?

15
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:02,562
Yes, we <i>are</i> who you think we are.

16
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,522
We are <i>Quincies</i>.

17
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,945
The Soul Society and Hueco Mundo
are being invaded by someone.

18
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:14,699
And they are most likely... Quincies.

19
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:17,535
Allow me to explain...

20
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,996
The proper name for this form is...

21
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,416
Quincy Voll Stern Dich.

22
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,753
As Quincies extinguish more Hollows
in the World of the Living,

23
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:30,215
the number of souls is diminished,
disrupting that natural balance...

24
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:31,925
If we allow this to happen,

25
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,677
the balance of souls
will eventually be ruined,

26
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:37,180
causing the Soul Society to flow
into the World of the Living...

27
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:41,559
ending in the simultaneous
destruction of both worlds.

28
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:44,854
Everything that is happening now
stems from the fact that

29
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,148
<i>you</i>, Head Captain,

30
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:52,779
couldn't kill that man
1,000 years ago!

31
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:54,989
Sklave Rai.

32
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:58,535
If possible,
I didn't want to use this...

33
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:04,582
because my holy wings would be
tarnished by such wicked beings.

34
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,135
A Bankai...!

35
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:16,970
If I destroy the disk on your head...

36
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,430
you can't use that absolute
subordination of Reishi anymore,

37
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,473
can you?!

38
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,308
The Quincy Extermination Operation

39
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:24,978
was finally carried out
200 years ago.

40
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:29,649
The Soul Reapers and Quincies
have no other choice but to fight...

41
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:36,781
Conflict is such
an unpleasant affair.

42
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:38,741
What the hell...?

43
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,995
Flaming pillars... of Reishi?

44
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:43,955
Sorry...

45
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:47,292
but our orders are to kill you all.

46
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:49,836
Tremble in fear, Soul Reapers.

47
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,840
The Stern Ritters are going to...

48
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,885
purge all of you.

49
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:22,785
{\an8}<i>The blue skies above are hopelessly clear</i>

50
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:27,999
{\an8}<i>At my wit's end, I feel a growing frustration</i>

51
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:32,879
{\an8}<i>As if to laugh at us hopeless cowards</i>

52
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:36,633
{\an8}<i>Countless eyes stare at us</i>

53
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:43,014
{\an8}<i>This soul of mine breaks again and again</i>

54
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:46,226
{\an8}<i>All I can do is hold it tight</i>

55
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:52,482
{\an8}<i>Until the day it turns to ash</i>

56
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,360
{\an8}<i>I've absorbed all of this sorrow</i>

57
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:59,989
{\an8}<i>It has shaped me, painted me</i>

58
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:02,825
{\an8}<i>But that's how we got here, right?</i>

59
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:07,789
{\an8}<i>One step at a time, just like breathing</i>

60
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,333
{\an8}<i>These countless scars on my palm</i>

61
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,377
{\an8}<i>That no longer fade</i>

62
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:16,089
{\an8}<i>Are my badge, my story</i>

63
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:20,051
{\an8}<i>I faced the fear and shred it to pieces</i>

64
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:23,096
{\an8}<i>And let it walk beside me once more</i>

65
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:27,809
{\an8}BLEACH: THOUSAND-YEAR BLOOD WAR

68
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,915
They're already within

{\an8}SQUAD 6 BARRACKS – ALLEYWAY

00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:56,212
have disappeared
in several other locations!

74
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:58,006
We believe they were
killed in combat!

75
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,883
Squad 3's Lieutenant Kira's
Spiritual Pressure has vanished!

76
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,219
Three seated officers of
the same squad have also vanished!

77
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:06,931
25 squad members have perished
in West 601 District...!

82
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:16,524
<i>This is madness...</i>

83
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:19,652
<i>There's no way
we can beat these guys!</i>

84
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,789
Stop...!
We won't let you through!

85
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:35,376
If you are scared,
feel free to run.

86
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:38,379
I can't make a good example
out of any of you.

87
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:40,923
You dare mock
the 13 Court Guard Squads?!

88
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:42,759
I told you to stop!

89
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:44,552
Haven't you noticed?

90
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:46,596
You're so overcome by fear that,

91
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,514
since the beginning,
you've subconsciously been

92
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:51,517
shifting the issue at hand from
life and death to dissuading me.

93
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:55,646
But the war has already begun.

96
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,634
That didn't seem like good news.

97
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:26,594
Did someone die?

98
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:29,639
Is there a need to answer that?

99
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:32,809
There is.

100
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:34,685
The Spiritual Pressures
that disappeared just now

101
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:36,145
came from Bazz-B's location.

102
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:39,690
If there are survivors,
then it means that he messed up.

{\an8}STERN RITTER "U"

Finding faults between comrades?

105
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:46,489
That's not art.

106
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:52,537
I always get flashes of inspiration
whenever I look at Izuru.

107
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:55,665
Just holding a guitar near him

108
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,459
causes melodies
to flow out of me like tears.

109
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:03,256
If Izuru is gone,
my guitar and I will be devastated.

110
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:06,926
Sorry.
I know nothing about art.

111
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,511
But don't worry...

112
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:13,099
You and your guitar will never
get the chance to weep.

113
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,977
Because you're going to die here
in five minutes.

114
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:19,105
I guess you really don't know art.

115
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,649
With the death of
so many of my men,

116
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,985
no guitar wouldn't weep.

117
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:27,488
My guitar and I
are already weeping.

118
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:30,867
Don't assume you're
getting out of this alive...

Don't retreat, you guys!

128
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,484
The mission of
the 13 Court Guard Squads

129
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,360
isn't to protect our own lives!

130

It's to give our lives
to protect the Seireitei!

131
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,703
We must not retreat!

132
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:21,209

They've made a doggy like you

174
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:28,456
they supposedly have a means

175
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:29,790
It's too dangerous!

I'm aware of that.

177
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,043
But these despicable people

178
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,296
are responsible for
Lieutenant Sasakibe's death

179
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:38,883
and caused bloodshed within
the Seireitei without warning.

180
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:44,472
Moreover, they are foes we cannot
defeat without using Bankai...

181
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:49,685
Which means that figuring out
a way to break that seal

182
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,270
will be the key to this battle.

183
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,272
Therefore, Renji...

184
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,651
If my Bankai is sealed away,

185
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,945
I want <i>you</i>
to finish them off with yours.

186
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,656
Captain...!

187
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,413
Bankai...

188
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,670
Senbonzakura Kageyoshi...

189
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,476
Kokujo Tengen Myo-oh!

190
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,603
Jakuho Raikoben!

191
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,022
Daiguren Hyorinmaru!

192
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:45,616
We were wrong...

193
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,661
This is <i>not</i> a seal!

194
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:00,589
My Bankai...

195
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,634
He stole it...!

196
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:24,613
You've gotta be kidding me!

197
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:28,367
She stole my Bankai?!

198
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:31,328
Your Bankai is <i>mine</i> now, Doggy.

199
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,497
I don't sense anything...

200
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,457
Say something...

201
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,419
Say... anything!

202
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,337
Hyorinmaru...!

203
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,465
Hyorinmaru!

204
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:48,304
Captain...

205
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,472
What are you doing, Matsumoto...?

206
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,225
Use Tenteikura!

207
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,351
Hurry!

208
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,478
Inform all the captains about this!

209
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,606
Tell them <i>not</i> to use their Bankai!

210
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:02,484
They don't seal Bankai...
they <i>steal</i> them!

211
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:08,991
{\an8}"13 COURT GUARD SQUADS"

212
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,410
Tenteikura!

213
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,043
They can steal them...?!

214
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,798
What are those fools doing?!

215
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:28,552
It seems Squads 2, 6, and 7
have had theirs stolen as well...

216
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,346
Those idiots!

217
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:33,641
Why couldn't they wait until
my analysis was complete?!

218
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,684
I can't believe their stupidity!

219
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,527
I suppose... we should be grateful.

220
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:50,032
With enough information,
Captain Kurotsuchi can usually

221
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:53,369
come up with a solution
within a day.

222
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:57,957
{\an8}SQUAD 8 BARRACKS – PERIPHERY

223
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:02,586
We had no idea when we'd find out
what your abilities were.

224
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:07,424
But you're not a foe
we can defeat without Bankai.

225
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:13,305
Which means, sooner or later,
someone had to become a sacrifice.

226
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:19,395
Grimmaniel...

227
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:27,736
Well, what do you know...

228
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,321
I tried putting on a brave face,

229
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,490
but I guess I'm more disturbed
than I thought...

230
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:33,826
This is a real problem, isn't it?

231
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:39,999
D-Damn it...

232
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,208
Bankai--

233
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,292
Stop!

234
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:46,046
We cannot afford to lose
your Bankai as well!

235
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,090
B-But Captain...!

236
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:53,595
Then how are we supposed to fight...

237
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,557
against these guys?!

238
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,651
Put me through to Ichigo Kurosaki!

239
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:08,986
Huh?
Yes, sir...

240
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,446
But we need
the Captain's permission--

241
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:11,780
The Captain is on the front lines!

242
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,200
I'll take full responsibility
for this.

243
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,914
Yes?
Ah! Hello, Mr. Akon.

244
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,458
It's been a while, hasn't it?

245
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,585
How are things going over there?
I'm--

246
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,837
<i>I told you it's an emergency!</i>

247
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,298
<i>I need to talk to Ichigo Kurosaki!
Put me through to him!</i>

248
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,008
Kurosaki?

249
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,177
- That's not possible.
- <i>Why not?!</i>

250
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:38,599
{\an8}"INCOMING CALL"

251
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,683
<i>Hunt Army.</i>

252
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:44,855
Damn it!

253
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,440
It's still not working!

254
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:51,653
<i>It seems the enemy
is trying to seal away</i>

255
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:53,739
<i>Kurosaki's Bankai or something.</i>

256
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:57,701
<i>But he's getting quite frustrated
because it's not working.</i>

257
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,495
- What?!
- "It's not working"?!

258
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:05,334
I know that the Soul Society
has been dealing with invaders.

259
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:10,089
The fact that you contacted me
must mean things are quite serious.

260
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:12,716
So let me go back
to my first question.

261
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:16,553
{\an8}"INCOMING CALL"

262
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:18,597
<i>Why?</i>

263
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:24,311
<i>I'm using my Voll Stern Dich
and even absorbed that monster,</i>

264
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,646
<i>so how is he able to...</i>

265
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,316
<i>surpass me so easily?!</i>

266
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:46,375
The guy I met the other day was
also trying to seal away my Bankai.

267
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,254
Why do you want to seal away
my Bankai so badly?

268
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:54,842
I'm not obligated
to give you an answer...

269
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:59,471
Could it be that...
you guys are afraid of Bankai?

270
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,598
Of course not!

271
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:05,227
The Wandenreich fears nothing--!

272
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,401
Thank you very much, Kurosaki.

273
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:15,404
You were able to disrupt
the enemy's defensive Reishi,

274
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,239
allowing me to deal a fatal blow.

275
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:18,365
Mr. Urahara...!

276
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,367
We have an emergency.

277
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,162
Please head to
the Soul Society immediately.

278
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:26,623
Ask Mr. Akon for the details
along the way.

279
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,209
<i>Is this Ichigo Kurosaki?</i>

280
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,461
<i>Listen carefully
without giving in to despair.</i>

281
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:34,089
Pass this message
to the Secret Remote Unit!

282
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:35,591
We have successfully
passed on the rescue request

283
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:36,717
to Ichigo Kurosaki!

284
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:40,220
Ichigo Kurosaki has already
escaped Hueco Mundo...

285
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,555
<i>Everything's going to be okay now...</i>

286
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,390
<i>He'll do something about this...</i>

287
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:47,102
<i>I just know Mr. Ichigo
will save the Soul Society!</i>

288
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,942
- Mr. Urahara!
- Ah, perfect timing!

289
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:58,030
That corpse there should be
carrying a palm-sized metal plate.

290
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,448
Please find it and bring it to me!

291
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,326
Mr. Urahara...
Where's Kurosaki?

292
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:06,371
I had Kurosaki
head to the Soul Society.

293
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,624
I'll explain later!

294
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,375
Right now,
I need to analyze the enemy!

295
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,254
They can steal Bankai?!

296
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,341
What are you talking about?
That's not possible--

297
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:18,967
I don't want to believe it myself!

298
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,137
But this is the information
we received

299
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:23,764
<i>from the captains of
Squads 2, 6, 7, and 10,</i>

300
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,307
<i>who have already had
their Bankai stolen.</i>

301
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,727
<i>No way...</i>

302
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,692
<i>Kurosaki,
I've analyzed the data I gathered</i>

303
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:38,487
<i>from your earlier battle
with the enemy.</i>

304
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:40,155
<i>Mr. Urahara?!</i>

305
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:44,493
There are three major abilities
of note that the Quincies possess.

306
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:49,248
The first is
the Quincy Voll Stern Dich.

307
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:53,377
The second is the ability
he referred to as "Blut."

308
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:57,047
By releasing Reishi
directly into their veins,

309
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:01,134
they can drastically increase their
offensive and defensive abilities.

310
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:04,096
It doesn't seem like they can use
both at the same time, though.

311
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,182
And the third
and most important one is...

312
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,184
<i>Bankai Plundering.</i>

313
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,186
<i>The key thing here is that</i>

314
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:15,357
your Bankai is the <i>only</i> one
they cannot steal.

315
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,694
<i>At the moment,
the reason for that is--</i>

316
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,281
What?!

317
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:25,826
The exit!

318
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,328
Mr. Urahara!
What's going on?!

319
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,205
<i>Mr. Urahara!</i>

320
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:40,674
<i>I let my guard down, thinking he'd
be dead from those injuries...</i>

321
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:42,217
<i>But that's...</i>

322
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:44,177
<i>Ransotengai!</i>

323
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,514
I won't let him get there...

324
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,392
The order given to me
by His Majesty was...

325
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,602
to keep Ichigo Kurosaki at bay...

326
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:55,564
even if it means my life!

327
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,446
What the hell is this?!

328
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:08,493
How unfortunate for you,
Ichigo Kurosaki!

329
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:13,290
You were so close to reaching
the Soul Society to defend it.

330
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:17,586
You no longer have the means
of escaping that prison.

331
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:21,506
You lose, Ichigo Kurosaki.

332
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:24,593
You will remain trapped
in that dark prison...

333
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:36,104
where you must helplessly wait
until the Soul Society falls.

334
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:47,866
{\an8}<i>Everything we had left behind</i>

335
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:52,329
{\an8}<i>Our breaths blending as mist</i>

336
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:56,750
{\an8}<i>without form or expression</i>

337
00:22:56,875 --> 00:23:01,046
{\an8}<i>We lie buried as we glare
into the distance</i>

338
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,007
{\an8}<i>I can't hear anything</i>

339
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:07,260
{\an8}<i>I can't seem to cut anything</i>

340
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,721
{\an8}<i>It feels like I'm sinking</i>

341
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,723
{\an8}<i>Falling, falling</i>

342
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:12,808
{\an8}<i>Touching</i>

343
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:16,353
{\an8}<i>Eyes struck wide open</i>

344
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:19,648
{\an8}<i>Something no one has ever seen</i>

345
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:25,946
{\an8}<i>The furthest reaches are now visible to us</i>

346
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:29,908
{\an8}<i>It cannot be undone
and cannot be stopped</i>

347
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:33,495
{\an8}<i>This ensuing struggle</i>

348
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:38,166
{\an8}<i>Whisk it away beyond
the ends of the earth</i>

349
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:40,335
{\an8}<i>Along with our breaths</i>

350
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,837
{\an8}<i>Take everything</i>

351
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:46,591
{\an8}<i>Whisk it away beyond
the ends of the earth</i>

352
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:48,635
{\an8}<i>Along with our futures</i>

353
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,512
{\an8}<i>Along with our world</i>

354
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,933
{\an8}<i>Something no one has ever seen</i>

355
00:23:54,933 --> 00:24:01,356
{\an8}<i>The furthest reaches are now
visible to us</i>

356
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:03,358
{\an8}<i>Don't you know God's demand?</i>

357
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,318
{\an8}<i>Don't you know God's demand?</i>

358
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:08,780
{\an8}<i>As we tear each other down</i>

359
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:17,998
<i>"The vow rests
in the shade of the willow."</i>

360
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:22,502
<i>"Even as the lightning fades."</i>
