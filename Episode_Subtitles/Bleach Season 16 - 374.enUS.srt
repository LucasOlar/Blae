1
00:00:11,928 --> 00:00:15,223
I want Units 11 through 16
to head over to West 56 District!

2
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:17,392
The rest of you
are to accompany me!

3
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,143
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

4
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:20,020
Leave the bodies
of the dead for later!

5
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:21,938
Transporting the injured
is our top priority!

6
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:23,690
We've got a critical patient here!

7
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:25,775
Please take him to room 203!

8
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:33,158
Captain Unohana...

9
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:35,910
was it really the right choice

10
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:37,954
for us to remain in
the Squad 4 barracks?

11
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,124
We could've saved more lives if we
were out there in the Seireitei

12
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:42,876
- with the rest of—
- Isane.

13
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:46,463
You shouldn't let your feelings
dictate what you say.

14
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:50,550
It would have been easy for us to
vacate this place out of concern.

15
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:56,306
But I know you are
not so short-sighted

16
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:59,809
that I have to explain
why that would have been wrong.

17
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:02,562
Yes, ma'am...

18
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:05,857
I'm...very sorry...!

19
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:08,985
There's no need to cry, Isane...

20
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:13,531
"Do not leave the Squad 4 barracks.
No matter what."

21
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:21,998
That was the final order given
to us by the Head Captain...

22
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:56,783
<i>The blue skies above are hopelessly clear</i>

23
00:01:56,866 --> 00:02:01,955
<i>At my wit's end, I feel a growing frustration</i>

24
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:06,793
<i>As if to laugh at us hopeless cowards</i>

25
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,630
<i>Countless eyes stare at us</i>

26
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:16,970
<i>This soul of mine breaks again and again</i>

27
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:20,181
<i>All I can do is hold it tight</i>

28
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:26,396
<i>Until the day it turns to ash</i>

29
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:29,274
<i>I've absorbed all of this sorrow</i>

30
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:33,903
<i>It has shaped me, painted me</i>

31
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:36,739
<i>But that's how we got here, right?</i>

32
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:41,703
<i>One step at a time, just like breathing</i>

33
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,247
<i>These countless scars on my palm</i>

34
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,249
<i>That no longer fade</i>

35
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:50,003
<i>Are my badge, my story</i>

36
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:53,965
<i>I faced the fear and shred it to pieces</i>

37
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,051
<i>And let it walk beside me once more</i>

38
00:02:57,135 --> 00:03:02,015
BLEACH: THOUSAND-YEAR BLOOD WAR

39
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:15,778
Here you go, sir.

40
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,531
According to this message
sent by Kisuke Urahara,

41
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:24,913
he, Orihime Inoue,
and Yasutora Sado are all safe.

42
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,831
However,
further details are unknown...

43
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:28,583
I see...

44
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,003
Let me go, you idiot!

45
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:33,504
The Captain...

46
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:34,714
There's no way Captain Zaraki

47
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:35,840
- would lose!
- Please calm down!

48
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:36,925
- You need rest.
- Captain!

49
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,384
- Get me a sedative! Hurry!
- Ichigo!

50
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,054
Come over here, Ichigo.

51
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:42,472
You need medical treatment.

52
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,015
No, I'm fine.

53
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,517
I already got some first-aid.

54
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:47,977
No, it's not okay!

55
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:51,105
I can tell that
you're badly wounded.

56
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,066
Ichigo...

57
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,402
Rukia and Abarai
have gotten out of surgery.

58
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:58,613
TRAUMA ROOM

59
00:03:58,696 --> 00:03:59,197
TRAUMA ROOM










They're no longer
in critical condition

60
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,907
They're no longer
in critical condition

61
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,742
and are now stable.

62
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,245
Please call me
if anything comes up.

63
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,833
- Ichigo...
- Rukia!

64
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,835
Is it all right for you to talk?!

65
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,506
She just said
our condition was stable...

66
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,592
Weren't you listening, you idiot?

67
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,760
Oh yeah...?

68
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,929
It seems your mouth
is working just fine...

69
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:25,807
Ichigo...

70
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:29,686
You came to protect
the Soul Society, didn't you?

71
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:31,688
Thank you...

72
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:32,772
Of course!

73
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:36,401
Though,
I couldn't do anything this time...

74
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:37,860
You dumbass...

75
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:40,613
You drove the enemy boss away!

76
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:44,784
If you hadn't come,
things would have been even worse.

77
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,954
You should be holding
your head up high, you idiot!

78
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:49,914
Hirako...

79
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,167
Mr. Ichigo Kurosaki!

80
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,044
Captain Kurotsuchi
would like to see you.

81
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:56,754
It's about your Zanpakuto...

82
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:04,679
Typical. He's always busy
no matter what the situation is.

83
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:08,975
Ignoring his wounds and caring
for everybody but himself.

84
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:11,936
Captain Hirako...

85
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:16,899
I wonder why Ichigo had
such a painful look on his face...

86
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,736
It seems he had
a rough time as well.

87
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:22,905
His Zanpakuto was broken,

88
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:25,325
and in the end,
he couldn't protect anybody.

89
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,160
He's probably exhausted.

90
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:28,953
There's no need to worry.

91
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:34,417
Do you really think...that's it?

92
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,713
I feel as if he's dealing with

93
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,967
something more serious
and he's trying to hide it...

94
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,350
The Head Captain's body
couldn't be found.

95
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:54,395
The enemy destroyed everything...

96
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,359
I have a report.

97
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,612
Squad 6 Captain Byakuya Kuchiki

98
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:05,740
and Squad 11 Captain
Kenpachi Zaraki

99
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,992
have both survived.

100
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:10,995
However,
it will be difficult for them

101
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,872
to return to their duties
as captains...

102
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,750
They may never
regain consciousness...

103
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:16,834
Get out!

104
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,253
I don't want to hear
such reports right now!

105
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,715
Can't you see that
we lost the Head Captain?

106
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,802
What more do you want us
to deal with?!

107
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,595
Stop.
You're embarrassing yourself.

108
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:28,930
Easy for you to say!

109
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,808
I know you and others held a grudge
against the Head Captain!

110
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,434
That's why you can stay so calm!

111
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,144
How dare you...!

112
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:36,687
Stop, Soi Fon!

113
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:39,899
Do you think you're the only one
who wants to scream?!

114
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:44,737
Now, now, now, now...

115
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,739
No fighting.

116
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,492
If Old Man Yama was still here,

117
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:52,703
he would've lined us up
and smacked us for sure.

118
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,624
He'd then say, "How pathetic
to see you cry and scream

119
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,251
in front of
the articles I left behind!"

120
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,086
Kyoraku, you bastard...

121
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:01,963
The Thirteen Court Guard Squads...

122
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,632
doesn't exist to grieve the dead

123
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:07,176
or cry over the destruction
of the Soul Society.

124
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:11,389
It exists to protect
the Soul Society.

125
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,767
Let's try to look forward.

126
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,812
We <i>are</i> the Thirteen
Court Guard Squads, aren't we?

127
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:20,857
"Can't fix it"?

128
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,191
Why not?!

129
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:26,237
You fix your Zanpakuto whenever
it gets broken, don't you?!

130
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,322
Are you stupid?

131
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,658
I don't "fix" mine.

132
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:32,743
I "modify" it.

133
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,580
The only thing
that can fix a Zanpakuto

134
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:38,624
is its owner's mind,
Spiritual Pressure,

135
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:42,378
and time to infuse them
into your Zanpakuto.

136
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,921
That's all.

137
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:46,716
Fine...

138
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:50,636
So you're saying I should
take it back and fix it myself.

139
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:53,556
Let me finish explaining.

140
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,809
I was only talking about Shikai.

141
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,687
The destruction of a Zanpakuto's
Shikai and Bankai

142
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,647
have completely different meanings.

143
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:06,277
A destroyed Bankai
can <i>never</i> be restored.

144
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,196
What?!

145
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:10,865
Then what should I do?

146
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:14,410
It's me.

147
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:19,957
- Come back here!
- Catch him!

148
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,501
- Kon?!
- Nooo!

149
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:24,921
I hadn't seen him in a while,
but he was in the Soul Society?

150
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,839
I see...

151
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,174
I thought so.

152
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:29,759
All right.

153
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,093
I'm on my way.

154
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:34,514
Come with me, Ichigo Kurosaki.

155
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,308
You should meet them.

156
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:40,561
Although I don't want to
in the slightest.

157
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,731
The great Squad Zero is coming.

158
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,070
Hirako!

159
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,906
Came to check it out too, Ichigo?

160
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,116
I don't really recommend it.

161
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,954
So where's this Squad Zero
coming from?

162
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:01,749
I mean, they're only showing up now
after the Seireitei got destroyed?

163
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,834
Where do they usually stay?

164
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:05,711
In the Royal Palace.

165
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,506
Is that not within the Seireitei?

166
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,717
Do you remember how those walls
came falling from the sky

167
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:12,885
when you first came here?

168
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:17,723
Those walls have been
surrounding this area

169
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:20,810
since things have been chaotic
in the Seireitei lately.

170
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:25,731
It was originally meant to surround
the Seireitei during emergencies.

171
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:27,775
So then...

172
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,361
If it's meant to protect
the Seireitei during emergencies,

173
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,989
what does this wall
normally protect?

174
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:35,866
Look, they're coming.

175
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:45,918
What is that?!

176
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,378
Tenchuren...

177
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:50,798
It's Squad Zero's
transport vehicle.

178
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,218
Squad Zero consists of
five total members.

179
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:56,512
Just five?!

180
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,139
They have no squad officers.

181
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,890
All five are captains.

182
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:01,976
Also...

183
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:04,312
...the combined strength
of those five...

184
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:08,190
...is greater than that of the entire
Thirteen Court Guard Squads.

185
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:36,552
Hell yeah!

186
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,347
We're here, we're here!
We're finally here!

187
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,434
Squad Zero's in the house!

188
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,937
Long time no see, you fledglings of
the Thirteen Court Guard Squads!

189
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,564
Have you been eating right,
getting enough sleep,

190
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,399
- and staying healthy?
- These guys are pretty different

191
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,276
from what I had in mind...

192
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,029
The hell was that for?!

193
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:57,657
It's been a while, Shinji!

194
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,659
Hiyori isn't with you?

195
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,661
- How rare!
- "It's been a while"?

196
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,245
I don't know you—

197
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,122
Wait... "Hiyori"?

198
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,333
Have you forgotten who I am?!

199
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,794
It's me, Kirio!

200
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,837
<i>Y-You're</i> Ms. Kirio?!

201
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:15,132
Seriously?! You're like
a completely different person!

202
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:19,303
Oh, Shinji!
I haven't changed <i>that</i> much!

203
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,223
Ah, I'm starving!

204
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,855
Hey! It's been a while,
hasn't it, Unohana?

205
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,401
So, the healing techniques
I taught you...

206
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,194
Are you putting them to good use?

207
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,445
Of course.

208
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:37,947
Really?!

209
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:42,576
Because I heard you guys
just lost a bunch of men!

210
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,704
So what's the story there?

211
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,623
Now, now!

212
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,625
It's been so long
since you've seen one another!

213
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,377
I'm sure you have
a ton of catching up to do,

214
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,586
but save it for later!

215
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:55,589
Well now...

216
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:59,093
I see everyone in Squad Zero
is the same as always, Osho!

217
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:03,639
So what business do you have
for coming here this time?

218
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:05,683
Hmm...

219
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,686
So you're Ichigo Kurosaki, huh?

220
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:13,816
We came here to rebuild
the Thirteen Court Guard Squads

221
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,609
at the behest of the Soul King.

222
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:21,657
For starters, Ichigo Kurosaki,
we're taking you back up with us.

223
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,242
Are you kidding me?!

224
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,953
I don't care how important
Squad Zero is,

225
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,788
but you were relaxing above

226
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,790
while the Seireitei
was getting destroyed.

227
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,125
But now, you come down,

228
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,877
wanting to rebuild
the Thirteen Court Guard Squads?!

229
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,171
Quit joking around!

230
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,507
Let's continue.

231
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:39,717
- So...
- Hey!

232
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:42,052
Shut up.

233
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,180
<i>What kind of move was that?</i>

234
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:47,224
"Quit joking around"?
That's our line.

235
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:49,226
What were you again?

236
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:52,188
The Thirteen Court Guard Squads.
Am I right?

237
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,357
Our job is to protect
the Royal Palace.

238
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:58,402
Your job is to protect
the Seireitei.

239
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:01,655
What kind of Court Guard
cries for help

240
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:04,283
after failing to get the job done?

241
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,869
You're not worthy
to bear that name.

242
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,372
That hurts, damn it!

243
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:14,084
I told you to save it for later.

244
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:17,463
Let's finish
what we came here for first.

245
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:18,589
No need.

246
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:19,757
Huh?

247
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,718
Everything on the list of things
we need to take with us...

248
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,887
They're all here.

249
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,268
All that is remaining is you...

250
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:35,064
Ichigo Kurosaki.

251
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:36,982
Unacceptable.

252
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,319
The three people
inside your spheres

253
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:43,989
are in no condition to leave
the Seireitei right now.

254
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,784
I cannot allow you
to take them with you.

255
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,414
That's exactly why
we're taking them with us!

256
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,334
I'm sure you're well aware

257
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:59,755
that you're not strong enough
to fully restore these three.

258
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:04,260
You already know, don't you, Retsu?

259
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:09,682
Medical care isn't what
you should be doing right now.

260
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,813
You broke into my lab as well, huh?

261
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:20,442
As always,
you're so disrespectful.

262
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:24,572
Oh, why if it isn't Mayuri.

263
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:28,576
As always, you exaggerate
by calling it a break-in.

264
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:32,872
When I placed my hand on the door,
it just slid right open.

265
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:34,832
However...

266
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:39,003
it was far less secure
than when I was around.

267
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,256
H-Hold on a second!

268
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,341
Why are you taking me as well?!

269
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,178
I can recover from these injuries
just fine in the Seireitei!

270
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,390
We know that.

271
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:54,810
You're the only one being taken
for a different reason.

272
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:56,645
"A different reason"?

273
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,606
<i>Hello there!</i>

274
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:01,734
<i>Well, it's been a while</i>
<i>since I've seen you all!</i>

275
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,277
<i>I'm sure you must have</i>
<i>been worried.</i>

276
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,738
<i>I'm so sorry about that.</i>

277
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,406
<i>Huh?</i>

278
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:10,868
<i>Hey, what gives?</i>
<i>I was hoping for a bigger reaction.</i>

279
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:13,787
What's going on here?!

280
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,832
- My head!
- <i>Oh! It's Kurosaki!</i>

281
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,376
<i>Thank goodness!</i>

282
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,462
<i>You're hurt,</i>
<i>but you look all right!</i>

283
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,464
Inoue!
Thank goodness!

284
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:24,632
You seem to be doing well!

285
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,176
<i>Yeah, I'm all right!</i>

286
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:29,762
<i>That you, Ichigo?</i>

287
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:32,139
<i>Thank goodness you're safe.</i>

288
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,435
That's my line.
I was worried too, you know.

289
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:41,023
<i>Well, the truth is,</i>
<i>I wanted to contact you sooner,</i>

290
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,608
<i>but a lot happened...</i>

291
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,860
<i>Huh?</i>
<i>What are you guys doing in there?</i>

292
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,238
That voice...
Could it be?

293
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,617
- <i>That voice!</i>
- <i>Inoue! Sado!</i>

294
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:52,618
<i>Kurosaki, you bastard!</i>

295
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,244
<i>You're there, aren't you?!</i>

296
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,621
- <i>No!</i>
- <i>Hey, why are you</i>

297
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,456
- <i>He's not here!</i>
- <i>with that guy, Urahara?!</i>

298
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:58,582
<i>Kurosaki...</i>

299
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,670
As you can see,
we're all right.

300
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,798
So please do what you have to do
for yourself...

301
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:12,304
You can decide on your own...
what you truly want to do...

302
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:18,060
<i>Oh, and don't worry about him.</i>

303
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,896
<i>We reached a nice agreement.</i>

304
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,648
<i>Well, see you later!</i>

305
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:28,445
Was it okay to tell him that?

306
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,114
Tell him what?

307
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:37,705
If he does
what he truly wants to do...

308
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:42,793
that will surely lead to
protecting us all in the end.

309
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:47,798
But you two should know that
better than I do.

310
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:50,718
And the person...

311
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:56,015
who knows that better than anyone
is Kurosaki himself.

312
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:58,767
Hey, Baldy...

313
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,686
Oh!
You're talking to me?!

314
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,899
If I go to this Royal Palace,
can I fix my Tensa Zangetsu?

315
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,235
That's impossible.

316
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:09,737
It can't be fixed.

317
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:11,697
However...

318
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,741
if you go to the Royal Palace,

319
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:17,703
we can reforge it into something
resembling your original sword.

320
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:22,624
Fine...

321
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,712
Take me with you
to the Royal Palace!

322
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:29,214
All right!

323
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,300
"WELCOME TO
KUKAKU SHIBA'S RESIDENCE"










Time to launch!

324
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:32,760
Huh?

325
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,763
Go!

326
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:42,269
Aren't there any seatbelts
in this thing?!

327
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:44,688
There he goes.

328
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,149
You sure it was
the right thing to do, Sis?!

329
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,026
Yeah.

330
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,028
If he doesn't go now,

331
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,864
the Soul Society is finished
when the next invasion comes.

332
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,117
We have no choice
but to let him go.

333
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:02,831
Even if that means
making Uncle sad.

334
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:07,086
All right, you guys!

335
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,546
Get back to Kukaku's
Great Training Hall already!

336
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,965
Help out with the training!

337
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:15,719
Don't forget who took you off
the streets of the Rukon District.

338
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,806
I'm getting tired of
her patronizing attitude...

339
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,432
Agreed.

340
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,726
Show some guts, Ganju.

341
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,980
You can cry or scream, but I'm
throwing you into the next battle!

342
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:29,399
Got it!

343
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,281
Come on out, Ichigo Kurosaki!

344
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:38,742
We've arrived!

345
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:39,618
THE ROYAL PALACE

346
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,787
THE ROYAL PALACE









This is the Royal Palace!

347
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,956
THE ROYAL PALACE

348
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:51,713
This is the place?

349
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:52,589
That's right!

350
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,258
Feel free to brag about it!

351
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:58,929
Ordinary Soul Reapers
typically aren't allowed here!

352
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:04,518
Though, I'm not sure if I can
call you an "ordinary" Soul Reaper...

353
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:08,689
<i>So this is the place Aizen</i>
<i>so desperately wanted to come to...</i>

354
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,441
Hold on a second!

355
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:15,195
I thought you couldn't get into
the Royal Palace without the Ouken!

356
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,281
Yeah, this is it.

357
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,200
The Ouken refers to our bones,

358
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:23,537
which were transformed
by the power of the Soul King

359
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,790
when we were selected
to join Squad Zero.

360
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:30,294
Therefore, there are two ways
to enter the Royal Palace...

361
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:35,841
We either choose to allow you in
or you come in with us...

362
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:39,553
Sosuke Aizen was
trying to make an Ouken.

363
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:40,637
In other words...

364
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:46,101
he was trying to create us
using his own spiritual powers.

365
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:49,813
He schemed to
take the place of a god...

366
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:53,400
by creating life
and killing the king...

367
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:56,904
Sosuke Aizen...

368
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:00,282
He truly is evil personified.

369
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,119
But take this to heart,
Ichigo Kurosaki.

370
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,664
The Quincies
that showed up this time

371
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:10,209
are an even greater evil...

372
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:16,548
All right.
Stand right there!

373
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,508
Ready?
I'm about to blast you now.

374
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,761
Don't move, or you'll die!

375
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,888
Okay, here goes...!

376
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:24,723
H-Hold on a second!

377
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:27,267
- What is it?
- Where am I heading to?!

378
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,936
Am I going to meet the Soul King?!

379
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,939
Huh? Are you talking in your sleep
or something?!

380
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:35,192
There's no way you'd be allowed
to meet the Soul King!

381
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:37,694
- That hurts, damn it!
- Explain it to him properly!

382
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,238
THE ROYAL PALACE - MAIN ENTRANCE









Listen closely.

383
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,448
THE ROYAL PALACE - MAIN ENTRANCE








Right now,
we're at the main entrance.

384
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:45,285
REIO GREATER PALACE








And over there is the main shrine,
the Reio Greater Palace.

385
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,621
REIO GREATER PALACE









That's where the Soul King resides.

386
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:48,205
REIO GREATER PALACE








And those five tray-like structures
floating around it

387
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:52,042
SQUAD ZERO RIDEN








And those five tray-like structures
floating around it

388
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,877
SQUAD ZERO RIDEN









are the Squad Zero Riden.

389
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,754
SQUAD ZERO RIDEN









Those are our castles.

390
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:58,465
Out of those...

391
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:03,971
you'll be first going to
my Kirinden—all of you!

392
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:06,807
"KIRINDEN"

393
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:11,270
What the hell is this?!

394
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:14,439
We're soaking in a hot spring,
of course.

395
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:15,691
Why are you drowning them?!

396
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:16,775
You're going to kill them!

397
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,694
Wait!
He's bleeding!

398
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,779
Quit your yapping.

399
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:23,657
I'm soaking them in this hot water
to squeeze out

400
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,784
their damaged Spiritual Pressure
along with their blood.

401
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,911
Damaged Spiritual Pressure?

402
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,622
You see that red hot spring
over there?

403
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:32,082
"BLOOD POND HELL"

404
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:33,834
"BLOOD POND HELL"










The sign says,
"Blood Pond Hell"...

405
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:36,086
"BLOOD POND HELL"











So that Blood Pond Hell...

406
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:40,590
We're going to take Byakuya,
who's completely squeezed out...

407
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:42,092
and toss him in there!

408
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,803
Hey!
He's on the verge of death!

409
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,680
I told you to shut up!

410
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:49,683
I draw out their blood
in White Bone Hell

411
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:51,893
and replenish it
in Blood Pond Hell.

412
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:54,146
I'll repeat this several times,

413
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:57,858
and in the end, every drop of
bad blood and Spiritual Pressure

414
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:00,777
in their bodies
will be swapped with my hot water!

415
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,238
That's the way I heal others!

416
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,699
Will doing this really work?

417
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:07,242
Shut up and soak.

418
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:09,369
With the kind of injuries you have,

419
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:14,583
one night is enough to make you
feel twice as good as normal!

420
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,752
"HOT SPRING DEMON" -
TENJIRO KIRINJI

421
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:27,262
<i>Everything we had left behind</i>

422
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:31,558
<i>Our breaths blending as mist</i>

423
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:36,063
<i>without form or expression</i>

424
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:40,359
<i>We lie buried as we glare</i>
<i>into the distance</i>

425
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,320
<i>I can't hear anything</i>

426
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:46,573
<i>I can't seem to cut anything</i>

427
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,076
<i>It feels like I'm sinking</i>

428
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,994
<i>Falling, falling</i>

429
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,079
<i>Touching</i>

430
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:55,582
<i>Eyes struck wide open</i>

431
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:58,919
<i>Something no one has ever seen</i>

432
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:05,217
<i>The furthest reaches are now visible to us</i>

433
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:09,221
<i>It cannot be undone</i>
<i>and cannot be stopped</i>

434
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:12,682
<i>This ensuing struggle</i>

435
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:17,479
<i>Whisk it away beyond</i>
<i>the ends of the earth</i>

436
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:19,648
<i>Along with our breaths</i>

437
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:21,149
<i>Take everything</i>

438
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:25,987
<i>Whisk it away beyond</i>
<i>the ends of the earth</i>

439
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,031
<i>Along with our futures</i>

440
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:29,908
<i>Along with our world</i>

441
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:34,204
<i>Something no one has ever seen</i>

442
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:40,585
<i>The furthest reaches are now</i>
<i>visible to us</i>

443
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,671
<i>Don't you know God's demand?</i>

444
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,589
<i>Don't you know God's demand?</i>

445
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:48,093
<i>As we tear each other down</i>

446
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:00,522
It seems you're awake...

447
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,482
Soul King.

448
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:14,244
<i>"Neither form nor soul</i>
<i>shall escape my blade..."</i>

449
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:19,416
<i>"Nothing...except you."</i>
