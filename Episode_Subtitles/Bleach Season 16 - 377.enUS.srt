1
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,430
You also noticed it, right?

2
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:18,560
That it was going to be useless
no matter how hard he tried.

3
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:24,441
I know the whereabouts of
every Asauchi I've forged.

4
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:30,071
All Soul Reapers
are given an Asauchi.

5
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:31,239
And through continuous training,

6
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:34,242
we transform them into
our personal Zanpakuto.

7
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:37,662
This is the foundation
and essence of the relationship

8
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:39,497
between Soul Reapers and Zanpakuto.

9
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,000
It is an absolute truth.

10
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:45,170
It's not just squad members
and captains...

11
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:48,089
but the Zanpakuto
of us Squad Zero, too.

12
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:52,552
Even a stray outlaw
like Kenpachi Zaraki...

13
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:57,098
gained an Asauchi by pulling it off
the corpse of a Soul Reaper.

14
00:00:58,767 --> 00:00:59,809
Every one of us.

15
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:02,771
Since the dawn of the Soul Society,

16
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:07,484
not a single Soul Reaper has
awakened their own Zanpakuto

17
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:11,196
without possessing
an Asauchi I forged.

18
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,282
It was obvious.

19
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:17,577
That this method
wasn't going to work for him.

20
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,914
You and I both knew that.

21
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,833
He's the only one
who doesn't understand that.

22
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:27,003
That's why he needs to know...

23
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:29,881
the whereabouts of his soul.

24
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:55,782
<i>The blue skies above are hopelessly clear</i>

25
00:01:55,782 --> 00:02:01,037
<i>At my wit's end, I feel a growing frustration</i>

26
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:05,875
<i>As if to laugh at us hopeless cowards</i>

27
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:09,629
<i>Countless eyes stare at us</i>

28
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:15,969
<i>This soul of mine breaks again and again</i>

29
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:19,180
<i>All I can do is hold it tight</i>

30
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:25,395
<i>Until the day it turns to ash</i>

31
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:28,273
<i>I've absorbed all of this sorrow</i>

32
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:32,902
<i>It has shaped me, painted me</i>

33
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:35,738
<i>But that's how we got here, right?</i>

34
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:40,702
<i>One step at a time, just like breathing</i>

35
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,246
<i>These countless scars on my palm</i>

36
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:45,248
<i>That no longer fade</i>

37
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:49,002
<i>Are my badge, my story</i>

38
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:52,964
<i>I faced the fear and shred it to pieces</i>

39
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:56,050
<i>And let it walk beside me once more</i>

40
00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:01,097
BLEACH: THOUSAND-YEAR BLOOD WAR

"KUROSAKI CLINIC"

42
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:19,824
I'm home...

43
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:22,785
Yo, Ichigo!

44
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,078
Long time no see—

45
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:27,957
That punk ran away.

46
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,427
What the hell is wrong with you?

47
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:40,511
"UNAGIYA"
What the hell is wrong with you?

48
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:41,804
"UNAGIYA"
You show up
for the first time in a while

49
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:43,014
You show up
for the first time in a while

50
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,807
looking like
it's the end of the world.

51
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,393
What are you, some school girl
who had a fight with her parents?

52
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:49,854
Sorry...

53
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:59,906
<i>I got kicked out without even
getting my Zanpakuto fixed...</i>

54
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,910
<i>I don't know how to
face them right now.</i>

55
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:09,791
Ms. Ikumi, thanks for—

56
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:12,877
Whoa, hot!

57
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:14,587
Eat it!
It'll warm you up!

58
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,925
I'm sorry, Ms. Ikumi...

59
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:23,513
for not showing up for work
and barging in on you like this.

60
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:36,484
I'd rather you came to work than
hear your apologies, you idiot!

61
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,945
From the moment I hired you,

62
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,989
I've felt like
an older sister to you.

63
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,783
You can come to me at any time!

64
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,286
Kids should rely on adults!

65
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:48,329
Ms. Ikumi...

66
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:51,916
Coming!

67
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,964
Huh?
There's no one here...

68
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,933
It seems like it was a prank...

69
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,935
Thanks, Ms. Ikumi.

70
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:12,687
I'm going home.

71
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,190
I'm fine now...

72
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,318
Hey, wait...

73
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,201
Ichigo!
You forgot something!

74
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,711
I guess I'll deliver this
to him tomorrow...

75
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,135
You came to pick me up
in that outfit...

76
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,304
You know what's going on,
don't you?

77
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:50,516
I heard what happened
in the Soul Society from Urahara.

78
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,852
Including the fact that
your Zanpakuto was broken

79
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,854
and that Squad Zero came down.

80
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:58,775
They kicked you out, didn't they?

81
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,236
Well, I can see why.

82
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:04,364
In your current state,

83
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:07,033
there's no way you can fix
your broken Bankai.

84
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:11,996
You don't know anything
about yourself.

85
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,801
Remember what you said to me?

86
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,971
That you could wait
until I was ready to tell you.

87
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,309
Now's that time.

88
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,645
Listen carefully.

89
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,688
You're not a Soul Reaper.

90
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:40,358
But you're not
an ordinary human, either.

91
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,404
Ichigo.
Your mother was...

92
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,382
My name is Masaki Kurosaki.

93
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:07,718
I'm a Quincy.

00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,286
I found you...

99
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:35,079
Captain!

100
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,082
Bull's-eye!

101
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:40,543
You broke my beautiful tailbone!

102
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,671
- I'll have to take the day off!
- Come on, let's head back.

103
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,590
I'm going to make sure
you do your job!

TOSHIRO HITSUGAYA
I've completed the documents, sir.

108
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,724
Well done, Toshiro!

109
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,392
Our soon-to-be captain!

110
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:57,685
Hold on!

111
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,062
I should be next in line
for the captaincy based on rank!

112
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,439
Are you kidding me?

113
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:05,151
If someone like you became captain,
the Squad would be ruined.

114
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,486
I agree.

115
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,696
I've been making progress
with my Bankai training,

116
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,531
so I think I'll do just fine.

117
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:11,824
Hey, Toshiro!

118
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,868
How could you
agree with him like that?!

119
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,371
Take it easy, you two.

120
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:18,539
Huh?

121
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,750
Does anyone know what happened
to the <i>manju</i> that I left in here?

122
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,419
Captain, by the way,

123
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:25,171
there's a report
that caught my attention...

124
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,797
"CASUALTY REPORT IN NARUKI CITY"
It's about this one...

125
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,634
Wait. Let's talk about
my <i>manju</i> first.

126
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:32,929
Have you seen the <i>manju</i>
I hid in there?

127
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:34,722
Shut up.

128
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,807
Who cares about your <i>manju</i>
right now?!

129
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,352
It was delicious!

130
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,062
So you did eat it!

131
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,272
Even worse,
you tried to brush it aside!

132
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:44,857
You're a naughty boy, aren't you?!

133
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,568
Do you remember the report
from two months ago?

134
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,613
It's from a mid-sized city
called Naruki...

135
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:53,658
where one of the stationed
Soul Reapers died in an accident.

136
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,743
Yeah, I do remember.

137
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,204
The one where the cause is
still under investigation, right?

138
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:02,416
Correct. We just received
last month's report...

139
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,963
TWO SOUL REAPERS DEAD
DUE TO AN ACCIDENT
Last month, two more died.

140
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:10,800
Hey!
Where are you going, Captain?

141
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:13,010
To investigate!
Take care of the rest, okay?!

142
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:15,680
Wait, you're leaving right now?
Alone?!

143
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:20,142
Yup! I should be back in two days,
so cover for me, will ya?

144
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:21,727
You can't be serious!

145
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,396
Shouldn't we report this
to the Head Captain?

146
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,731
We're going after him, Toshiro!

147
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,400
No, let's not.

148
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,318
What are you saying?

149
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:30,611
The Captain went alone because

150
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:33,030
he figured this investigation
would be dangerous.

151
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,741
I know that!

152
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,493
- That's exactly why—
- That's <i>exactly</i> why...

153
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:40,204
...we should wait here.

154
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,749
At our current level,

155
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,961
we would only get in his way.

156
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:58,180
Any progress?

157
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,641
No, none at all.

158
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:03,144
We've been successful
in equipping Hollows

159
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,730
with the ability
to Hollowfy their targets...

160
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,523
but not even the souls of
Court Guard members

161
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:08,608
can withstand it.

162
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:10,443
I see...

163
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,153
No matter.

164
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,279
We are close to narrowing down

165
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,740
the location of Shinji Hirako
and the others.

166
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,117
We get to conduct
Hollowfication experiments

167
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,577
while we smoke them out.

168
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,537
It's two birds with one stone.

169
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:24,915
Let's take our time.
Gin. Kaname.

170
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,586
Everything is in
the palm of our hands.

171
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:32,131
JUNE 4TH, 20:22 - NARUKI CITY

172
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,675
It's getting cloudy...

173
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,802
I don't like this...

174
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,888
The last guy
and the guy before that

175
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,848
died on a rainy day, didn't they?

176
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,975
Let's not talk about it...

177
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,770
I see...
It's dangerous on rainy days, huh?

178
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,480
That's good to know!

179
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,149
Captain Shiba!

180
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,359
What are you doing here?!

181
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,487
Oh, I was looking for the bathroom
and got lost...

182
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,489
That's a terrible lie!

183
00:10:56,906 --> 00:11:00,117
If it rains tonight,
you guys can go home.

184
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,663
I like to pee in peace.

185
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,337
SAME DAY, 20:36 -
KARAKURA TOWN, ISHIDA RESIDENCE

186
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,757
How is everything at school,
Miss Masaki?

187
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:17,843
Oh, me?!

188
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:22,682
Well, I go there every day,
Aunt Izumi!

189
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:26,477
Then how about your Seiren?

190
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,313
My Seiren is going...

191
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:30,856
so-so, I guess...

192
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:33,776
What do you mean "so-so"?!

193
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,319
Yes, I'm sorry!

194
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:38,322
Do you understand
the situation you're in?!

195
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,533
Your predecessors passed away
and you have no siblings,

196
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,743
making you the sole surviving
member of the Kurosaki family.

197
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:45,746
We've only taken you in
because you're a fellow Quincy!

198
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,081
Mother!

199
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,083
Please stop.

200
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,585
I could hear you from outside.

201
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,340
I'm going back to my room.

202
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:00,678
Where's Father?

203
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,263
He's at Fünfte Feld.

204
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:05,599
I too would like to know
when he'll be back.

205
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:11,897
- Masaki...
- Hm?

206
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:13,607
I'm sorry.

207
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,359
Please forgive my mother.

208
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,737
She's taking her loneliness
out on you.

209
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:20,781
Don't be silly, Ryu!

210
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,324
There's nothing to forgive.

211
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,743
I'm not angry at all!

212
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:25,703
Thanks for the meal!

213
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,164
Oh!

214
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,666
The shrimp au gratin
was great tonight.

215
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,251
Bye!

216
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,595
Katagiri...

217
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,598
Yes, what is it, Young Master?

218
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,266
Masaki...

219
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:52,646
She knows the only reason
she was brought into the family...

220
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,524
is because Mother wants to protect

221
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,985
the Echt Quincy blood
in the Ishida Family.

222
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:01,614
Is that what your mother told her?

223
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,450
You really think
she needed to be told that?

224
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:06,994
She's not that stupid.

225
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,289
Do you think...

226
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:13,834
she would be happy marrying me?

227
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,464
Young Master...

228
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,966
I see you believe that
happiness is necessary

229
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,551
for a marriage between Quincies.

230
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:25,846
You are so kind.

231
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:34,396
Your kindness would be more than
enough to make Miss Masaki happy.

232
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:36,941
Don't be silly...

233
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,527
What's so kind about me?

234
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,572
I only want to make
Masaki happy because,

235
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:45,324
without happiness,

236
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:48,118
it is impossible
to look to the future.

237
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:50,621
I'm not referring to our future,

238
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,582
but that of the Quincies.

239
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:07,805
NARUKI STADIUM - NEAR SOUTH GATE

240
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,682
It's starting to rain hard...

241
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:15,145
<i>Either they're specifically
targeting Soul Reapers</i>

242
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,648
<i>or they're just reacting to
high Spiritual Pressure...</i>

243
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,776
<i>I'll try baiting them out
with Spiritual Pressure...</i>

244
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,113
Whoa!

245
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,614
Amazing!

246
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:28,075
So this is Captain Shiba's
Spiritual Pressure!

247
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,289
Damn it!

248
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,708
The size of Spiritual Pressure
is not what they're attracted to!

249
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,262
A <i>black</i>...Hollow?

250
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:01,609
<i>I see...</i>

251
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,319
<i>Its whole body is black,</i>

252
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,779
<i>and its hole appears to be
covered up...</i>

253
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,406
<i>but judging from
its Spiritual Pressure,</i>

254
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,741
<i>that's definitely a Hollow!</i>

255
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:14,663
<i>I sense...</i>

256
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:17,166
<i>a massive Spiritual Pressure
on the move...</i>

257
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,169
<i>A Hollow... and another one....!</i>

258
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:25,925
Don't bother, Masaki.

259
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,636
How many times must I remind you?

260
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:32,932
We Quincies should only head out
<i>after</i> the Soul Reapers are dead.

261
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,894
And even then,

262
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,647
it is tradition to let Katagiri
and other Gemischts handle it.

263
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:41,732
Think of your position.

264
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,694
You need to take
better care of yourself.

265
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:51,492
We Echt Quincies should not
shed our blood so readily.

266
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:54,703
But, Ryu...

267
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:03,671
<i>This thing looks like a Hollow,
but it fights like a Soul Reaper...</i>

268
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,547
<i>It's making it difficult to fight!</i>

269
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:09,885
Captain Shiba!

270
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:13,389
Karakura Town is under
Squad 13's jurisdiction!

271
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:15,307
Run!

272
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:26,151
Ryu. You always think about
Aunt Izumi, Quincies,

273
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:30,030
the future, and many other things
before you act.

274
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,658
I really admire that about you.

275
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:34,785
But...

276
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,038
To me,
"taking better care of myself"

277
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:41,625
means doing what I can, when I can.

278
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:47,214
If I followed customs
and let someone die today

279
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,174
when I had the chance
to prevent it,

280
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,553
I know my future self
will never forgive me.

281
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,606
Katagiri, we're heading out.

282
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,152
What the hell was that?

283
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:09,862
Was it a Cero?!

284
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,823
That thing is fighting
like a Menos...

285
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:18,203
Each time it devours a Soul Reaper,
it's getting stronger and smarter!

286
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:24,084
Hey, there's no way
a monster like you

287
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:27,880
could go on a rampage without
being noticed by the Soul Society.

288
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,631
Who sent you?

289
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,676
Of course, you're not answering.

290
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,722
Burn, Engetsu!

291
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,270
What...?!

292
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:57,659
<i>That attack was done with
a Zanpakuto!</i>

293
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:59,453
<i>It's a Soul Reaper!</i>

294
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:03,040
<i>There's a traitor
pulling the strings!</i>

295
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:04,666
White...

296
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,922
He is covered in a black armor,

297
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,800
yet called "White"
due to the whiteness within him...

298
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,218
How ironic.

299
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:23,310
Don't underestimate me,
you piece of shit!

300
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,410
You're still able to fight
after losing an arm?

301
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:41,662
I'm impressed!

302
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:45,624
Damn it!

303
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,883
Who the hell... is that?!

304
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,136
A Quincy...!

305
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:00,389
This is not a part of our plan.
I shall eliminate her.

306
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,473
Wait.

307
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:02,975
Let's see what happens.

308
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:05,894
Bastard...!

309
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:13,193
<i>It's fast!</i>

310
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,403
<i>In that case...</i>

311
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:17,698
You idiot, what are you doing?!

312
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:25,622
Good...

313
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,916
I've got you now.

314
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:48,770
Are you all right?!

315
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,689
Yeah...
Oww...

316
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,901
Thanks, you saved me...

317
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,944
You're the one who saved me...

318
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,071
If you hadn't protected me,

319
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,281
you wouldn't have been
injured so badly...

320
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,994
Then I guess this means we're even!

321
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,665
I'm going to heal you.
Hold still.

322
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:09,833
Okay...

323
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,920
But, man...
To take that thing out by yourself...

324
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,464
Who are you, anyway?

325
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,009
<i>What should I tell him?</i>

326
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:24,514
<i>What would this Soul Reaper do
if he finds out I'm a Quincy?</i>

327
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,606
My name is Masaki Kurosaki.

328
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,651
I'm a Quincy.

329
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:46,203
I see, you're a Quincy, huh?

330
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,623
I've never seen a real one before!

331
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:51,124
But, wow...

332
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:55,254
I feel lucky getting to meet
a Quincy in person.

333
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,551
<i>What's with this person?</i>

334
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,805
<i>Is this what Soul Reapers are like?</i>

335
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:10,352
<i>I wonder if all the other
Soul Reapers are like this.</i>

336
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:16,650
<i>I hope they are...</i>

337
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:21,071
<i>Then I'm sure that Ryu, Aunt Izumi,
and everyone else would...</i>

338
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:26,868
Let's go, Katagiri.

339
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:29,079
Masaki is safe.

340
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,082
There weren't any problems.

341
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:33,834
Got it?

342
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:38,755
Yes, understood, Young Master.

343
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,675
The fact that
he self-destructed means

344
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,219
he not only surpassed
the target Hollowfication phase,

345
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:47,764
but reached the final
metastasize phase!

346
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,058
And he passed it onto a Quincy!

347
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,103
What an utter failure!

348
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,439
That's not true.

349
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:58,775
There are times when
straying from the initial goal

350
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:00,736
is the superior outcome.

351
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:02,863
How exciting.

352
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:06,783
A Hollow created from
a dead Soul Reaper

353
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:11,788
decided to choose a Quincy,
the polar opposite of himself.

354
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:16,168
Don't you want to see
what happens next?

355
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:28,138
<i>Everything we had left behind</i>

356
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:32,642
<i>Our breaths blending as mist</i>

357
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:36,938
<i>without form or expression</i>

358
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:41,234
<i>We lie buried as we glare
into the distance</i>

359
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:44,196
<i>I can't hear anything</i>

360
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:47,449
<i>I can't seem to cut anything</i>

361
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:49,951
<i>It feels like I'm sinking</i>

362
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,870
<i>Falling, falling</i>

363
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:52,954
<i>Touching</i>

364
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,666
<i>Eyes struck wide open</i>

365
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,795
<i>Something no one has ever seen</i>

366
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:06,093
<i>The furthest reaches are now visible to us</i>

367
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:10,097
<i>It cannot be undone
and cannot be stopped</i>

368
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:13,642
<i>This ensuing struggle</i>

369
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:18,438
<i>Whisk it away beyond
the ends of the earth</i>

370
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,607
<i>Along with our breaths</i>

371
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,109
<i>Take everything</i>

372
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:26,863
<i>Whisk it away beyond
the ends of the earth</i>

373
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:28,907
<i>Along with our futures</i>

374
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:30,784
<i>Along with our world</i>

375
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:35,080
<i>Something no one has ever seen</i>

376
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:41,670
<i>The furthest reaches are now
visible to us</i>

377
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:45,465
<i>Don't you know God's demand?</i>

378
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,969
<i>As we tear each other down</i>

379
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:15,078
<i>"Even with your sins,
you are like the sun."</i>
