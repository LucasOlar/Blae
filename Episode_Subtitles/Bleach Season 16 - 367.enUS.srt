What's the Sutra Scale at?

It's currently at Category 4...
It's quite serious.

reporting this.

I'm sorry, sir.

12
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:52,343
There have been minor ones
in the past...

13
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:55,263
but we've been able to handle them
with only slight adjustments.

14
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:58,892

25
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:21,372
Isn't it obvious?

26
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,794
To be capable of erasing
the very existence of Hollows...

27

Focus on exterminating those Hollows!

You got that? No fighting--

33
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:11,464
That hurt!

34
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:14,008
Don't be so quick
to hit me, Shino!

{\an8}SQUAD 13 OFFICER – RYUNOSUKE YUKI

41
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,644
I know that, but...

42
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,312
I'm just worried,
you know?

43
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,439
What's there to worry
when you're with me?!

44
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,400
No, that's not what I meant.

45
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,236
I've heard that the rate of
Hollow appearances

46
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:34,696
in Karakura Town is high...

47
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,447
It makes me wonder

48
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,825
if I'm the right person to be sent
to a place like this...

49
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,327
Besides, I heard that this town

50
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,872
has a really strong
Substitute Soul Reaper.

51
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,166
So what's the point of me
even being here?

52
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,377
Listen to yourself!
Stop being such a wuss!

53
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,964
They increased the number of
personnel stationed here to two...

54
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:55,300
so that we <i>don't</i> have to rely on
this Substitute Soul Reaper as much!

55
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:56,801
Which means...!

56
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:59,387
They acknowledged your abilities.

57
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,432
But they're adding personnel
to prevent

58
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:03,975
this super strong person
from fighting...

59
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:04,851
It doesn't make sense--

60
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,269
Oh, just shut up!

61
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:09,272
I'll take the north side.
You patrol the south.

62
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:11,357
What? We're not going together?!

63
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:12,984
That would be a waste of time.

64
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:15,820
What's the point in sending
two of us then?

65
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:19,115
Or what? Are you scared?

66
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,743
Just say so if you are.

67
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:23,620
That's right, I'm scared!

68
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,705
Don't say it with such a resolute face!
You're pathetic!

69
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:26,831
I'm done with you.

70
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,167
Go by yourself and
grow some backbone!

71
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,960
Huh? C'mon!

72
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:02,200
That Shino...
I admitted that I was scared.

73
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,619
And she still makes me go
on patrol alone...

74
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,206
Please don't let me come
across any Hollows...

75
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,125
"Clank"?

76
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:29,018
It's here! It's here! It's here!

77
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,271
Shino, it's here!

78
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,202
Shino! Shino! Shino!

79
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,620
Shino! Shino! Shino!

80
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,247
Hey, Shino--!

81
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,515
<i>I have to do this...</i>

82
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:10,101
<i>It's just the two of us...</i>

83
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,354
I have to...

84
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:14,897
save Shino...!

85
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:24,991
<i>Huh? No way... How...?</i>

86
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,577
<i>Just from that one hit...?</i>

87
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,497
<i>Am I...going to die?</i>

88
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,168
<i>No...</i>

89
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:39,547
<i>I don't want... to die...</i>

90
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,291
I gave you both some first aid.

91
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,460
I'll come back to heal you
when this is over.

92
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,129
Okay then...

93
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:28,763
Let's settle this quickly.

94
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,080
There are so many...

95
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,040
How can they take on all of them?

96

97
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:01,796

Your arrow was way more dangerous!

108
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,061
What?!

109
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,605

110
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:06,736

Huh?

122
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,268
We're here!

123
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,852
I brought some delicious bread!

124
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:25,106
Oh, you're awake!
Thank goodness!

125
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,692
You sure you want to claim
that they're delicious?

126
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,361
Those bread are leftovers,
meaning they didn't sell well, right?

127
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:33,614
Fine. No bread for those
who say such things!

128
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,741
Inoue's right.

129
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,202
You're the one who always
enjoys them the most.

130
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,038
Talk about ungrateful.

131
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:43,124
– I agree.
– Shut up!

132
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:46,711
By the way, what's with walking in
without ringing the doorbell?!

133
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,838
We met Yuzu right outside.

134
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,340
How about you stop talking
and get us some plates?

00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,759
Why do I have to take orders
from <i>you</i>?!

136

00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:01,684
You shut up too!

140
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,894
Y-Y-You're that guy from last night...!

141
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:06,856
You just realized that now?
No wonder you were so unresponsive.

142
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:10,359
For the record,
that was two days ago, not last night.

143
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:11,235
Huh?

144
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,946
You were asleep for over a day!

145
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:15,906
That long...?

146
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,701
– Shino! What about--?
– Here!

147
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,038
It's your share. Eat. It's good.

148
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,831
Uh... But...

149
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,583
You can't eat like that.

150
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,877
Hurry up and get into
that gigai next to you.

151
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,128
Next to me?

152
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,215
Do you have to scream
every damn time?

153
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,718
Why're scared of your own gigai?

154
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:38,804
No, that's not it.
I have no time for this.

155
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:42,141
Shino... Is Shino all right?!

156
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,184
I'm back.

157
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,353
I bought the colas...

158
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,482
Ryunosuke...!

159
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,693
Shino! Thank goodness.

160
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,404
– Your wound is healed--
– You're pathetic!

161
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,907
– Okay, let's eat.
– She dropped the cola...

162
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,909
– I think he'd like this yakisoba bread.
– Wait, wait! Shino, that hurts!

163
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,577
– Let's save it for him.
– Quit whining, you wimp!

164
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:02,912
– You're only saying that
– Hurry up

165
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,246
– ‘cuz you don't want it.
– and get inside your gigai!

166
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,209
Oh yeah.
I haven't asked your name yet.

167
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,337
You're right.

168
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:15,091
Allow me to answer. I'm Ebern.

169
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:20,763
Want to know my full name?
It's Asguiaro Ebern.

170
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,015
Any other questions?

171
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:26,727
I don't know who you are,
but get off my bed.

172
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,897
I beg your pardon.
Can you repeat that?

173
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,816
I didn't quite catch
what you just said.

174
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:35,236
I said, I don't know who you are,
but get off my bed.

175
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:36,946
I refuse.

176
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,533
Who was that?

177
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,786
He was wearing a Hollow mask...
Could be an Arrancar.

178
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,079
Who knows?

179
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,790
I'll go and drive him away.

180
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,792
{\an8}"KUROSAKI CLINIC"

181
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:53,671
Um... Who was that just now?

182
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,589
Beats me.

183
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:02,638
Why did he kick me
all of a sudden?

184
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,014
Is he an idiot?!

185
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:04,515
Hey!

186
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,185
I bet you're here
because of me, right?

187
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:10,104
I'll hear you out, so follow me!

188
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:12,690
You think I'm here
because of <i>you</i>?

189
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,400
You're so full of yourself...

190
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:18,904
But you must be curious
about who I am!

191
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:19,947
Nope.

192
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,828
So, was Ishida right?
Are you an Arrancar?

193
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,955
Arrancar?

194
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,708
Did you come alone?
Did someone send you?

195
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,003
What do you have to gain
from fighting me?

196
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:37,089
Me? An Arrancar?

197
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:44,972
What's wrong?

198
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,777
Hey, that's a Quincy's...

199
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,570
What's the matter?

200
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,907
See something familiar...
Ichigo Kurosaki?!

201
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:06,410
{\an8}RUKON DISTRICT – WEST 64 DISTRICT, SABITSURA

202
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,122
There's really nobody here...

203
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,208
There's no way
anyone in the Rukon District

204
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,501
could disappear
without being noticed.

205
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,378
Especially not on our watch.

206
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,589
There were supposed
to be a few left

207
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:20,883
{\an8}SQUAD 11 FIFTH SEAT – YUMICHIKA AYASEGAWA

208
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,883
at the time
we got the report.

209
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,511
Which means
the situation is getting worse.
{\an8}SQUAD 11 THIRD SEAT – IKKAKU MADARAME

210
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,347
Third Seat Madarame!
Fifth Seat Ayasegawa!

211
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:29,600
We searched the entire area,

212
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,852
but we couldn't find
even a single child!

213
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:34,271
So the entire village's been
spirited away...

214
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,440
This is almost supernatural.

215
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:40,528
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm not settling for that explanation.

216
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,196
Um...

217
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:45,407
What ? Is there something else?

218
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:49,078
Actually, there's something
you need to see...

219
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,373
It's these footprints...

220
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:55,668
They all come together here
in one spot, then cease.

221
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,587
You see what I'm seeing, Yumichika?

222
00:13:58,879 --> 00:13:59,713
Yeah.

223
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,259
The footprints are either
from sandals or bare feet.

224
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,178
This wasn't the work of
a Hollow or some such...

225
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:11,433
The residents of the Rukon District
abducted their own people.

226
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,103
What?! What does that mean...?

227
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:17,189
It's our job to find out!

228
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:20,943
Keep looking!
There may be other clues!

229
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:21,944
– Yes, sir!
– Yes, sir!

230
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:31,328
{\an8}"CLEAR"

231
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:36,333
{\an8}SQUAD 1 BARRACKS – HEAD CAPTAIN'S OFFICE

232
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,421
That was Sasakibe's...

233
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,506
Head Captain! Reporting...!

234
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,134
Who's there...?

235
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,179
It is nice to meet you...

236
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,807
Head Captain of
the 13 Court Guard Squads...

237
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:55,269
Shigekuni Genryusai Yamamoto...
I presume.

238
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,606
We have come to declare war.

239
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,779
<i>That item he was carrying...</i>

240
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,364
<i>If so, is he...?</i>

241
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:13,662
<i>But the mask he's wearing is
only worn by Arrancars...</i>

242
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,248
I must admit, I was shocked.

243
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:18,751
This office is like
the private quarters

244
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:21,378
of the Head Captain of
the 13 Court Guard Squads.

245
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,964
And yet,
it was so easy to infiltrate.

246
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:28,010
Perhaps your attention
to security is a bit low?

247
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,012
I have nothing to fear.

248
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,097
I am here.

249
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,767
There is no greater security
than that.

250
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,102
I see...

251
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,192
Sasakibe...!

252
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,777
Don't mourn for him.

253
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,695
He should be praised.

254
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:51,241
He has single-handedly demonstrated
the fate that awaits your people.

255
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,118
In other words,

256
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:56,372
a hopeless death
following a desperate struggle.

257
00:15:57,081 --> 00:16:00,209
Five days from now,
the Soul Society...

258
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,878
will be annihilated by the Wandenreich.

259
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,307
Those eyes...

260
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:19,228
You must want to ask,
"Who are you people?"

261
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:24,608
Yet you also know that we would
never answer that question.

262
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:28,320
You should be able to guess
who we are.

263
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:31,740
Farewell.

264
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:34,243
Stop right there!

265
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,044
What's the matter, Ichigo Kurosaki?

266
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,587
Is dodging the best you can do?

267
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,716
Is that the extent of your powers?!

268
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:50,718
<i>That's odd...</i>

269
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,262
<i>All he's been doing is taunting me.</i>

270
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:57,182
At this rate, you'll never be able to
beat me without using your Bankai!

271
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,976
<i>Another taunt...</i>

272
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:06,942
<i>I don't know who he is,
or why he's attacking me.</i>

273
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:09,111
<i>I guess I have no choice...</i>

274
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,321
<i>but to play along.</i>

275
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,327
They got away...!

276
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:20,080
M-Master Genryusai...

277
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,794
Th-There is something
I must tell you...

278
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,047
Ban...

279
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:30,507
<i>Here it comes!</i>

280
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,010
Th-The enemy...

281
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:36,096
<i>This is it, Ichigo Kurosaki!</i>

282
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,348
Our Bankai...! They can...

283
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:42,686
<i>Your Bankai...</i>

284
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,980
<i>ends here!</i>

285
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,398

286
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,947

Getsuga... tensho!

292
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,326
Damn it... Why...?

293
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,830
Why won't his Bankai disappear?!

294
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:47,501
What do you mean by
my Bankai disappearing?

295
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,336
In the last five minutes,

296
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:51,171
I've got a ton of questions
I wanna ask you.

297
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,840
You're coming with me.

298
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:54,800
Damn it...

299
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,345
Don't worry.

300
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:02,683
This "shadow" only hides the chosen.

301
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,521
Damn it!

302
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:09,857
<i>What the hell was that?</i>

303
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:13,026
<i>It wasn't a Garganta
that Arrancars use.</i>

304
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:48,770
If it isn't Ebern.

305
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:52,649
How commendable of you
to be waiting, bowing down.

306
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:53,984
You fool...

307
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,612
As if I would ever bow down to you.

308
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,113
What?

309
00:19:58,405 --> 00:19:59,448
Who do you think
you're talking to...?

310
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,574
Enough.

311
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:03,202
Huh?

312
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:10,167
How many times must I remind you?

313
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:13,170
Do not argue in my presence.

314
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,882
I dislike conflict.

315
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:22,346
Now then, let me hear your report
