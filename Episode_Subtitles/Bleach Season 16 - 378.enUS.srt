1
00:00:11,052 --> 00:00:13,388
That is everything
I have to report, sir.

2
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:15,765
Understood.

3
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,893
An unauthorized sortie
is a violation.

4
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,729
However,
your quick and decisive action

5
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,565
helped minimize squad casualties...

6
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:28,069
and curtailed any serious harm
to the World of the Living.

7
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:29,487
Therefore...

8
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,908
I will overlook your violation
of squad rules!

9
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:35,117
Yes!

10
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:36,202
I mean...

11
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:37,662
Thank you, sir!

12
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:43,208
I'd say failing to retrieve
the remains of this mystery Hollow

13
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,253
is a serious enough crime.

14
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:46,880
By the way...

15
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,092
Your report only describes
how unusual the Hollow was...

16
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:54,888
I trust you didn't leave
anything out.

17
00:00:55,513 --> 00:01:00,643
That...
there was nothing else noteworthy?

18
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:06,941
Yes, sir.
There wasn't anything else.

19
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:11,696
JUNE 5TH, 11:00
SEITO ACADEMY HIGH SCHOOL

20
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:18,912
<i>I wonder</i>

21
00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:21,539
<i>if that Soul Reaper made it back
to the Soul Society safely...</i>

22
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,459
<i>I hope he's not in trouble...</i>

23
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:30,590
<i>I should have at least
asked for his name.</i>

24
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:34,219
THE SEIREITEI - SQUAD 10 BARRACKS

25
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:42,018
<i>I guess those rumors about Quincies
still being alive were true.</i>

26
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:46,438
<i>It must have taken a lot of courage
for her to save me...</i>

27
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,485
<i>and tell me that she's a Quincy,
knowing that I'm a Soul Reaper.</i>

28
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,196
<i>She's really something.</i>

29
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,950
<i>I should have chatted with her
a bit more.</i>

30
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,374
Maybe I'll go back
and thank her properly this time.

31
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:08,128
I told you, Ryu is my cousin!

32
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,004
There's nothing going on
between us.

33
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:13,258
You're living together,
so there <i>has</i> to be something!

34
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,717
Come on...

35
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:17,553
Huh?
H-Hey!

36
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:18,638
Masaki?

37
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,057
Oh, I-I'm sorry!

38
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,393
Don't worry about it.

39
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:25,645
I hope you're okay, young lady.

40
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:28,856
Are you okay?

41
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,942
Hey! Was that a new trick
to meeting people?!

42
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:33,236
Why would you think that?!

43
00:02:57,051 --> 00:03:01,890
<i>The blue skies above are hopelessly clear</i>

44
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:07,103
<i>At my wit's end, I feel
a growing frustration</i>

45
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,900
<i>As if to laugh at us hopeless cowards</i>

46
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:15,653
<i>Countless eyes stare at us</i>

47
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:21,993
<i>This soul of mine breaks again and again</i>

48
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:25,205
<i>All I can do is hold it tight</i>

49
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:31,461
<i>Until the day it turns to ash</i>

50
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,339
<i>I've absorbed all of this sorrow</i>

51
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:38,968
<i>It has shaped me, painted me</i>

52
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:41,804
<i>But that's how we got here, right?</i>

53
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:46,768
<i>One step at a time, just like breathing</i>

54
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,270
<i>These countless scars on my palm</i>

55
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,272
<i>That no longer fade</i>

56
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:55,026
<i>Are my badge, my story</i>

57
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:58,988
<i>I faced the fear and shred it to pieces</i>

58
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:02,157
<i>And let it walk beside me once more</i>

59
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:06,871
BLEACH: THOUSAND-YEAR BLOOD WAR

60
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:21,216
ISHIDA RESIDENCE I'm back!

61
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,846
- Welcome home, Masa—
- Miss Masaki.

62
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:25,390
Y-Yes?

63
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:26,808
I'd like a word with you.

64
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:31,144
I heard you fought against
a Hollow the other night

65
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:32,814
to save a Soul Reaper.

66
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,107
Huh?

67
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:37,777
No... I haven't done...
anything of the sort...

68
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,029
You only disgrace yourself
by lying.

69
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,239
<i>Katagiri!</i>

70
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,324
Why did you do such a thing?

71
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:45,159
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?!

72
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,286
How could you
break the rules of the Quincies

73
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,414
while in the care of
the Ishida Family?!

74
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,791
Katagiri!

75
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,002
Why did you tell Mother?!

76
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:55,586
I thought I told you!

77
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:57,588
That there weren't
any problems that night!

78
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,551
But there was... a problem!

79
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:03,176
What?

80
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:06,848
Miss Masaki sustained a wound
from the Hollow's attack!

81
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:10,600
If she doesn't get proper
Quincy treatment

82
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,103
from your father and mother,

83
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,272
there is a possibility
the future Ishida bloodline

84
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,815
could become tainted!

85
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:17,941
ISHIDA RESIDENCE

86
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:18,276
That's nonsense!

87
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:19,652
Nonsense?

88
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:22,238
It means <i>everything</i> to us!

89
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,115
You said so yourself!

90
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:28,244
That your marriage to Miss Masaki
was for the future of the Quincies!

91
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:31,497
Damn it!

92
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,251
Tell me the truth!

93
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,002
W-Well, umm...

94
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,588
Please wait, Mother!

95
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,549
Masaki isn't to blame
for what happened!

96
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,427
- Masaki was...
- I-It's all right, Ryu!

97
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:45,928
I'll be...

98
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:49,474
Miss Masaki?

99
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:50,683
Masaki!

100
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,354
What's wrong?!
Are you in pain?

101
00:05:58,608 --> 00:05:59,609
No...!

102
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,528
Is that... a Hollow's hole?

103
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,113
What do you think you're doing,
Ryuken?

104
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,032
Where's Father?!

105
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:08,159
We're trying to get in touch
with him right now.

106
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:09,577
You will wait here.

107
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:12,788
Wait!

108
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,248
You can't be with that thing!

109
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:17,250
You'll put yourself in danger!

110
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,336
Come back!

111
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:19,921
Please...

112
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:21,589
Come back, Ryuken!

113
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:31,140
<i>What is this thing
that resembles a Hollow's hole?</i>

114
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,434
<i>Why is she in so much pain?</i>

115
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,770
<i>What's happening to Masaki?</i>

116
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:39,022
<i>Why didn't I stop her by force?</i>

117
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:42,902
<i>Why didn't I do everything I could
to interrupt that battle?</i>

118
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:44,862
<i>Why?!</i>

119
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:56,249
Whew, that was a close one!

120
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,084
It almost got you!

121
00:06:58,876 --> 00:06:59,877
It's you!

122
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,130
What's wrong?

123
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,135
Wait, let me take a look at her!

124
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:08,386
Don't touch her!

125
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:12,140
Why do you think
this is happening to her?

126
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,725
It's because she protected you!

127
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:21,149
She broke the rules of the Quincies
to protect you, a Soul Reaper...

128
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,484
And because of that,
she was wounded...

129
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,988
Why does Masaki
have to go through this?!

130
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:31,033
That wound is what's causing this?

131
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,286
I can't think of
any other explanation.

132
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,162
I'll never forgive you for...

133
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,581
Let's stop right there.

134
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,793
There's no time to argue.

135
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:44,088
Please come with me, both of you.

136
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:48,050
I'll tell you the choices
you have to save her...

137
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,658
<i>I'm falling...</i>

138
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:16,370
<i>Falling down a peaceful hole.</i>

139
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:22,919
<i>It's quiet, dark and lonely...</i>

140
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,380
<i>Yet, I'm not scared...</i>

141
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,508
<i>I have this feeling...</i>

142
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:32,428
<i>that someone who needs me
is waiting for me down there...</i>

143
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:35,848
<i>Who's there?</i>

144
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,442
"URAHARA'S SHOP"
I've been researching the same
symptom that she is exhibiting

145
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:50,028
I've been researching the same
symptom that she is exhibiting

146
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,073
for close to a hundred years.

147
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,533
A hundred years?!

148
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,409
Just who are you anyway?

149
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,704
My name is Kisuke Urahara.

150
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,332
I was banished
from the Soul Society.

151
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,917
<i>You're</i> Kisuke Urahara?

152
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,087
I don't care who you are!

153
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,589
Hurry up and restore Masaki
back to normal!

154
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:11,413
I never said anything about
restoring her back to normal.

155
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:12,885
What?

156
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,334
I'll give it to you straight...

157
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,097
That young lady...

158
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:19,642
Masaki can never go back
to the way she used to be.

159
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:23,938
Her condition
is known as Hollowfication.

160
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:28,024
Hollowfication is what happens
when a Hollow's soul

161
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,777
is poured into another soul,

162
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:33,447
destroying the boundaries
between the two souls.

163
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:38,077
It is the result of an attempt to
sublimate a soul to a higher level.

164
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:42,123
Originally, it was meant to
strengthen a Soul Reaper's soul.

165
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,874
However,
souls that undergo Hollowfication

166
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,961
eventually become
mindless monsters,

167
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:50,923
and ultimately self-destruct
against their will...

168
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,050
a process known as Soul Suicide.

169
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,721
Hollowfication is
an uncontrollable technology.

170
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,888
Uncontrollable?!

171
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:02,310
Doesn't that mean there's no way
to save Masaki?

172
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,604
I can't return her
to the way she was,

173
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,565
but I <i>can</i> save her life...

174
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:14,113
During my research
over the past hundred years,

175
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,617
I discovered a way to prevent
this Soul Suicide.

176
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:20,869
It involves injecting something
into the victim's soul

177
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,539
that can counteract Hollowfication...

178
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:26,291
This allows the soul
to maintain balance

179
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,336
so that their boundaries
won't get destroyed.

180
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,796
Thus, preventing a Soul Suicide.

181
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,407
Let me give you a specific example.

182
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,677
If we inject
a Hollowfied Soul Reaper

183
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:41,765
with a vaccine made from a Quincy's
light arrow and a human soul,

184
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:44,602
they'll remain in
whatever state they're in.

185
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:49,023
However, Quincies have
no resistance against Hollows,

186
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,859
so the vaccine isn't enough...

187
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,486
I don't understand what you mean.

188
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,279
To put it in simpler terms,

189
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:57,030
we're trying to neutralize it

190
00:10:57,031 --> 00:11:00,159
by hitting it
with a counteracting force.

191
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:04,037
To save this Quincy girl's life,
prevent her Hollowfication

192
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:07,041
while retaining
her existence as a human...

193
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,961
we need a stronger
counteracting force.

194
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,546
Something that must
remain by her side

195
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:14,882
at all times until she dies...

196
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,510
A powerful counteracting force

197
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:20,137
that continues to suppress
her Hollowfication...

198
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:21,263
You're lying!

199
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,975
There must be some other way...!

200
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,478
You're quite sharp.

201
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,146
You quickly figured it out.

202
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:33,067
However...
you have no choice in this matter...

203
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:35,736
The one with a choice...

204
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,322
is you, Isshin Shiba.

205
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,077
Soul Reapers are
the opposites of Quincies...

206
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,705
Humans are the opposites
of Hollows...

207
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:50,126
Currently, Masaki is a hybrid
of a Quincy and a Hollow...

208
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,753
To counteract that, we need...

209
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:56,132
someone who is a hybrid
of Soul Reaper and human.

210
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,137
This is a special Gigai I created...

211
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,306
It was created from a human soul.

212
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:07,392
It envelops the soul
that enters it,

213
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,936
making them completely human.

214
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,731
You understand now, don't you?

215
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:16,610
If you use this, you'll become
a hybrid of Soul Reaper and human.

216
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:20,823
Which means you can
become her opposite.

217
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:24,910
<i>This</i> is the choice
I'm presenting to you.

218
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:30,082
However, this choice has
far too many downsides for you.

219
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,250
I must bind your soul

220
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:36,546
to Masaki's soul
and the Hollow within her

221
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:39,216
with a string of Reishi.

222
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,428
For as long as Masaki lives...

223
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:43,762
No...

224
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,640
It will be forever passed down
to her descendants.

225
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,976
While you are in this Gigai,

226
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:52,188
not only will you be unable to
use your Soul Reaper powers,

227
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,024
but you won't even
be able to see Hollows.

228
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,694
And it's likely that
once you get in...

229
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:02,114
you'll never return to being
a Soul Reaper ever again...

230
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,787
<i>This has only downsides for him!</i>

231
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,370
<i>There's no way he would accept
something like this!</i>

232
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:11,915
<i>He'd never—</i>

233
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,584
Okay, I'll do it!

234
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:16,795
- What?!
- I said I'll do it!

235
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:17,879
Hurry up!

236
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,924
Man, you talk too much!

237
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,382
I have to quit being a Soul Reaper

238
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,028
and protect her
for the rest of her life, right?!

239
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,428
Of course, I'll do it!

240
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,731
You're okay with giving up
your current life?

241
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,433
Are you kidding me?

242
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:30,810
Hell no!

243
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:32,978
But so what?!

244
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,481
If I let the person
who saved my life die

245
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,858
because I couldn't make a decision...

246
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:40,110
I know my future self
will laugh at me!

247
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,242
Very well.

248
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,120
I shall begin the procedure.

249
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:02,466
Yo...

250
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,010
I'm here to protect you.

251
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,224
Hey, Hollow!

252
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,058
Now that I'm here,

253
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:15,020
I won't let you
lay a finger on her!

254
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:21,193
Getsuga... Tensho!

255
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,919
I've successfully
connected your souls.

256
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:40,838
She'll be all right now.

257
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,089
I see...

258
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:43,465
Thank goodness...

259
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:50,055
You're that Soul Reaper
from the other day...

260
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:54,101
Please tell me your name...!

261
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:57,146
Thank goodness...

262
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:18,292
Did you leave Miss Masaki behind...

263
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,169
with the Soul Reaper?

264
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,047
I did.

265
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,550
Go home and tell my mother...

266
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:30,888
that Ryuken is unqualified
to protect the Quincies.

267
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,933
- No. I'm not leaving.
- I said go home.

268
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,434
No.

269
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,058
I will not leave you here
by yourself, Young Master.

270
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,605
- Katagiri...!
- Master Ryuken...

271
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:40,940
Have you forgotten?

272
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:47,696
It is my duty to devote
my entire life to serving you.

273
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:51,075
From the day I first met you,

274
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,370
my life has belonged to you.

275
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:56,622
So please...

276
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,166
Please do not be sad.

277
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,754
When you are sad,

278
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,715
it tears my heart apart.

279
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,509
When you cry...

280
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,678
Katagiri...

281
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:12,972
That's enough.

282
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:14,515
Let's go home.

283
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:22,398
Yes, understood, Young Master...

284
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:30,197
<i>After that,
soon after graduating high school,</i>

285
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,950
<i>Masaki left the Ishida family.</i>

286
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,661
<i>Her soul was mixed with a Hollow.</i>

287
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:38,831
<i>For the Quincies,
it was the proper decision...</i>

288
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,707
"KUROSAKI CLINIC" <i>As for me,</i>

289
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,948
<i>I made use of the medical skills
I learned at the Academy</i>

290
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,920
<i>and opened up a small clinic.</i>

291
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:48,590
<i>There were a ton of things
I had to learn,</i>

292
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:52,094
<i>but with Urahara's help,
I somehow managed.</i>

293
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,596
<i>When Masaki became
a college student,</i>

294
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,099
<i>she would often come by
to make fun of my white coat.</i>

295
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,478
<i>I told Masaki that I lost
my Soul Reaper powers</i>

296
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:05,649
<i>because I was banished from
the Soul Society for screwing up.</i>

297
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:12,531
<i>She probably saw through my lies
from the moment I told her that.</i>

298
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,242
<i>I was terrible at lying</i>

299
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:18,162
<i>and her intuition
was incredibly sharp.</i>

300
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:24,877
<i>So lying to her felt trivial
and meaningless.</i>

301
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,880
<i>She would always
see through my lies</i>

302
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,133
<i>and forgive me for telling them...</i>

303
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:35,220
<i>In a movie we saw together,</i>

304
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,097
<i>an old man compared the old woman
he spent many years with</i>

305
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,683
<i>to the sun.</i>

306
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:43,020
<i>I don't remember
the rest of the movie</i>

307
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,510
<i>aside from the fact that
it made Masaki burst into tears,</i>

308
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:48,067
<i>but that one line stuck with me...</i>

309
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,278
<i>Masaki was like the sun...</i>

310
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:55,741
<i>She attracted everything,
forgave everything,</i>

311
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,786
<i>illuminated everything,
and spun everything around...</i>

312
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,413
<i>I was just...</i>

313
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:06,210
<i>happy to be spun around by her.</i>

314
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:09,713
<i>And then...</i>

315
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,715
you were born.

316
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:15,385
You already know the rest.

317
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,310
By coming into contact with Rukia,
you gained your Soul Reaper powers...

318
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,184
By training with Urahara,
you gained your Zanpakuto...

319
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:25,854
And through your battles
in the Soul Society,

320
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,649
the Hollow in you was awakened.

321
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:35,113
The fact that it was released
means that my Soul Pressure

322
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,449
was no longer able to suppress him.

323
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,538
And so, my connection to my Gigai
and that Hollow was broken.

324
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,039
That's how I regained
my Soul Reaper powers

325
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,375
for the first time in 20 years.

326
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:51,505
I probably don't need to explain
the things you already experienced.

327
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:53,590
But...

328
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,468
there is still one thing
that you've experienced

329
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,846
that you don't know
the whole story about.

330
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,098
Nine years ago from today...

331
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:02,933
June 17th...

332
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,894
The day your mom died.

333
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:08,939
You need to know...

334
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:14,486
the real reason
your mom died that day...

335
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:25,497
<i>Everything we had left behind</i>

336
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:30,002
<i>Our breaths blending as mist</i>

337
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:34,298
<i>without form or expression</i>

338
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:38,594
<i>We lie buried as we glare
into the distance</i>

339
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:41,555
<i>I can't hear anything</i>

340
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,808
<i>I can't seem to cut anything</i>

341
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:47,311
<i>It feels like I'm sinking</i>

342
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,270
<i>Falling, falling</i>

343
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,355
<i>Touching</i>

344
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,858
<i>Eyes struck wide open</i>

345
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:57,196
<i>Something no one has ever seen</i>

346
00:19:57,321 --> 00:20:03,493
<i>The furthest reaches are now visible to us</i>

347
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:07,456
<i>It cannot be undone
and cannot be stopped</i>

348
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:10,917
<i>This ensuing struggle</i>

349
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:15,797
<i>Whisk it away beyond
the ends of the earth</i>

350
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,966
<i>Along with our breaths</i>

351
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,467
<i>Take everything</i>

352
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:24,223
<i>Whisk it away beyond
the ends of the earth</i>

353
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,266
<i>Along with our futures</i>

354
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,143
<i>Along with our world</i>

355
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:32,481
<i>Something no one has ever seen</i>

356
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:38,861
<i>The furthest reaches are now
visible to us</i>

357
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,948
<i>Don't you know God's demand?</i>

358
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,866
<i>Don't you know God's demand?</i>

359
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:46,328
<i>As we tear each other down</i>

360
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:50,707
Your mom...

361
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,044
She wasn't supposed to
die that day...

362
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,004
What do you mean?

363
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,049
Your mom...

364
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:00,634
Masaki...

365
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:02,886
Even though she had merged
with a Hollow,

366
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,597
she was originally an Echt Quincy.

367
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:09,767
Her defensive ability,
the Blut Vene,

368
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,728
was exceptionally powerful.

369
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,148
Not only could she defeat
Grand Fisher,

370
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:20,070
but she could have done it without
getting a single scratch on her.

371
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:21,571
However...

372
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,790
That didn't happen...

373
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:33,708
Why not?

374
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,920
It's because she lost
her Quincy powers that day...

375
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,046
But how?!

376
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,049
What happened... nine years ago?!

377
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,135
Auswählen.

378
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:45,429
AUSWÄHLEN

379
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:49,474
It's a Quincy selection process
conducted by Yhwach himself.

380
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,394
I heard of a Quincy tale

381
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:56,315
that sang praises of a king
who was sealed away.

382
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,317
According to that,

383
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:03,530
The confined Quincy King
regains his pulse after 900 years.

384
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:06,199
His mind after 90 years.

385
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,036
His strength after 9 years.

386
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:15,875
Yhwach robbed Quincies
he deemed impure of their powers

387
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,919
and made them his own.

388
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:19,588
As a result...

389
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:25,260
Uryu's frail mother,
Kanae Katagiri, lost her life...

390
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:31,016
And how Masaki lost her powers
and lost her life in battle...

391
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:32,726
How?

392
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,936
How is he able to do that?

393
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:36,971
Is it because he's their king?

394
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,940
Who is Yhwach anyway?!

395
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:44,279
Yhwach is the Father
of the Quincies.

396
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:47,115
The Quincies started from him...

397
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:52,412
And all Quincies have his blood
running in their veins.

398
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:56,874
<i>The memories within
your Spiritual Pressure</i>

399
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,876
<i>have awakened too soon.</i>

400
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,754
<i>It is unable to contain Quincies!</i>

401
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:05,008
<i>You don't know anything
about yourself, do you?</i>

402
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:09,054
<i>Not even about... your own mother.</i>

403
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:13,975
<i>Farewell, Ichigo Kurosaki...</i>

404
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:18,939
<i>my son... born in the dark...</i>

405
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:23,777
Dad...

406
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:26,988
Thanks.

407
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,035
No problem.

408
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:41,294
Hey, Ichigo...

409
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:48,093
You forgot this...
I came to deliver it to you.

410
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:56,977
Thanks, Ms. Ikumi.

411
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:00,355
Dad...

412
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,318
I'm going.

413
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:14,578
<i>"I believe the world
is full of danger."</i>

414
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:17,914
<i>"I want to protect you from it."</i>

415
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:24,129
<i>"Only because inside me is
the same impulse as that danger."</i>
