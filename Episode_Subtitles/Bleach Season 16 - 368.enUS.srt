1
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,930
Don't force yourself, Ludaas.

2
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,730
Even sitting with that wound is agonizing.

3
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:25,940
I'll let you talk while you lie like that.

4
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,940
Head... Head over head.

5
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:29,980
Only...

6
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:34,450
... if you're not going to sit, I don't need your legs.

7
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,080
What... What the hell!

8
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:44,790
Am I going to talk while lying in front of you?

9
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:50,630
Your humble servant Ludaas would never disrespect you like that!

10
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,540
I understand.

11
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,810
Submit your report then.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Translation: Magnum357 Control: MiracA

13
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,830
But it's late.

14
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,500
Kim?

15
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,920
What do you mean who? I say Kurosaki!

16
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,720
Aren't we going to help or something?

17
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,640
There's no need. The enemy's soul force has long since disappeared.

18
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:06,970
Kurosaki wouldn't lose to someone of that level.

19
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,640
I have no intention of helping.

20
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:12,400
Are you saying so? Because I would.

21
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,980
N'oldu Inoue?

22
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:22,860
I was thinking how close you were with Kurosaki.

23
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:27,040
I love this side of you, let me tell you.

24
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,920
What is it? Don't wave!

25
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:33,250
I came!

26
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,250
Welcome Kurosaki! Did you get hurt?

27
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,920
No, I'm not injured either...

28
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:44,390
Sorry, my soul phone is ringing.

29
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,010
Hello, this is Yuki.

30
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,230
- What happened? - Thing...

31
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,650
Collective notice sent to all divisions.

32
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,480
Listen. I will give you a summary of the current situation.

33
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,950
Don't ask questions. What I will say will not be repeated.

34
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,350
57 minutes ago, 7 unknown persons infiltrated the 1st Division headquarters.

35
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,080
It was withdrawn 52 minutes ago.

36
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,190
One of the 1st Division died, but nothing happened to the Commander-in-Chief.

37
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,960
Meanwhile, at the Kokuryo Gate, where the 1st Division is guarding...

38
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:20,010
... an unknown person appeared.

39
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,430
In a conflict that lasted 182 seconds, all 116 soldiers were killed.

40
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,680
Deputy Commander Sasakibe was seriously injured in this conflict...

41
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,980
…and soon died in the 1st Division commander's room.

42
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:35,640
What's more!

43
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,290
Deputy Commander Sasakibe...

44
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:40,180
...he had served Commander-in-Chief Yamamato for years!

45
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,490
How could he have died?

46
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:48,530
Finally... the entry and exit methods of the enemies remain a mystery.

47
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,960
There is no sign of tampering with the spirit protection shield surrounding the Seireitei.

48
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:58,380
We think they have a mode of transportation that crosses the shield.

49
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:37,500
It doesn't get out of my head. I'll go patrol.

50
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,680
I-what-go!

51
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,640
In the?

52
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,020
Extreme Acceleration!

53
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,940
First Name! Long time no see...

54
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,190
... is this how you do it?

55
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,570
Ichigo, we're in trouble.

56
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:12,910
Help, Ichigo.

57
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:16,160
Hueco Mundo... Hueco Mundo...

58
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,120
It means five days.

59
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:25,920
Yes. Enough time for us and the Soul Society to prepare for war—

60
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,300
You are talking about the future.

61
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:33,460
And two days ago, when you went to check the border density level...

62
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:37,710
...if we continue to move forward in this direction, with Soul Society in the near future...

63
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,140
...the world of the living, because of the imbalance of spirits...

64
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:44,610
... will disappear. That's exactly what you said.

65
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,150
Lüdaas Friegen.

66
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:52,780
Are you a seer standing before me now?

67
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,950
Ben...

68
00:06:55,370 --> 00:07:01,330
Answer me. I ask if he is a priest.

69
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,880
No. I am not.

70
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:07,800
On what grounds are you talking about the distant future, then?

71
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:12,050
I want to hear now.

72
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,420
- Boars. - Emredin!

73
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:22,100
You deserve neither praise nor punishment.

74
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:26,800
You were enough to stall Kurosaki Ichigo.

75
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,760
Thank you!

76
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:37,160
You did your bit. You will be the foundation of the road to peace.

77
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,420
- No trouble, sir? - Like what?

78
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:45,020
Arrancar soldiers...

79
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:48,530
...isn't it a valuable unit because they don't need training?

80
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,550
I do not care.

81
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:55,390
Finding Arrancar is easy.

82
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:04,100
Hueco Mundo is now my territory.

83
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:11,070
It's nothing more than a cornerstone of the Soul Society invasion.

84
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,950
Hollow World mu?

85
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,070
What's going on Nel? What do you mean Hueco Mundo was hacked?

86
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:18,910
by whom?

87
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,580
Extreme Acceleration!

88
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,000
I had concealed my existence until the very last moment!

89
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:30,250
You even avoided this, bravo to you Kurosaki Ichigo!

90
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:34,300
Oh sorry! You don't know who I am underneath!

91
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,970
Who am I to say! I...

92
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,350
Peaches.

93
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:46,020
Seireitei, Crematorium

94
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:23,020
Near.

95
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,770
I'm sorry, I gathered you at this hour.

96
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:33,650
It's not a problem. Is that true?

97
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,150
Konusu Hollow World.

98
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:39,950
TRUE. After losing Baraggan and Starrk...

99
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:44,040
...His Holiness Harribel became the ruler of Hueco Mundo.

100
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,580
But even he...

101
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,080
Avoid.

102
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,960
Quick!

103
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:43,010
Lets go!

104
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,050
His Holiness Harribel!

105
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,700
We do not know why they took His Holiness Harribel.

106
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,620
They took His Holiness Harribel!

107
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,800
Do you know who they are or their purpose?

108
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:10,790
Unfortunately.

109
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:14,380
But we know they took a lot of Arrancar.

110
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,920
They cornered us while we were trying to escape...

111
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:20,630
...and they caught Dondoçakka!

112
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,850
Kurosaki Ichigo, please help us!

113
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,770
Kurosaki.

114
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:35,900
It's wrong to ask. Are we going to help?

115
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,530
After hearing this, I cannot remain indifferent.

116
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,990
Kurosaki Ichigo!

117
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,120
Ichigo!

118
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,690
Don't worry...

119
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,790
... but this time I will not be able to help you.

120
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,370
At work.

121
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:57,210
I am Quincy. I can't save the Hollows or the Arrancars.

122
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:59,340
Yes.

123
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,490
The Quincys exist to destroy the Hollows, right?

124
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,390
I expected you to say that.

125
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,980
I thought I'd call anyway, you'd be shy or something.

126
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:13,890
Kurosaki.

127
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:16,810
Be careful.

128
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:21,360
Don't worry. We'll get through without you.

129
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:24,200
- The enemy this time... - I see...

130
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,120
... an interesting love is going on.

131
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:32,080
Shall I assign you to Hueco Mundo?

132
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:50,670
Your Majesty.

133
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:56,190
The locket you gave Ebern... There are signs of use.

134
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:57,770
But...

135
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:04,320
How could you come at such a good time?

136
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:10,640
Is not it certain? I was waiting outside the window for the right moment.

137
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,560
Garganta - I said.

138
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:17,480
It's hard not to notice that two Arrancars have fallen from Hueco Mundo.

139
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,000
Also, your previous fight...

140
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,280
...and the abnormal activity at Soul Society is more than enough for caution.

141
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:28,790
You noticed too, didn't you?

142
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:34,560
Kurosaki, the current events are all connected.

143
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,670
Now things got serious.

144
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:41,020
Yes, we're at the exit!

145
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,490
Hueco Mundo - Come on, quick!

146
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,570
Don't stop, keep walking!

147
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,330
A, we're in the air! The enemy is below us!

148
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,920
What Urahara Bey always does!

149
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,590
- How well do you know me! - We're falling!

150
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:08,050
- What happened? - It's like I heard a voice.

151
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,970
It can't be. Except for the dead...

152
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,890
... all those who stayed there are here.

153
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:16,930
- That's how it came to you. - It's possible.

154
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,070
It seems we go unnoticed.

155
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,110
Is Dondoçakka among the prisoners?

156
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,700
No, I don't feel spirit power. Probably in another group.

157
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:34,490
The reason they don't come back here is...

158
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:40,500
... knowing that all the Hollows and Arrancars here are dead.

159
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,510
- You don't see them. - It's a scary sight.

160
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,560
Unfortunately. It's like no one is alive.

161
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:03,230
I hadn't given in. That's their style.

162
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,470
Look at this.

163
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:08,070
This is the condensed soul particle flame they use.

164
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:13,870
Thanks to this, the stone and sand of Hueco Mundo, which did not burn under normal conditions, burned.

165
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,200
In the face of those who use a force we have never seen...

166
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:20,870
... we were completely stunned.

167
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,880
We had no choice but to flee.

168
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,110
Then those who were just taken...

169
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,090
They may want to use it as a vanguard.

170
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,890
In the worst-case scenario, they're just like the ones here...

171
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,890
Understood. Let's go save it.

172
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:39,770
Hold on! There is no Dondochakka there!

173
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:43,850
So what? We will save Dondochakka anyway.

174
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:47,320
What difference does it make if we save a few Arrancars on the way?

175
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,860
So... It's true that you're right.

176
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,850
Wait, don't go!

177
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,740
Look at this job. The Arrancars he went to rescue...

178
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:01,330
... is he not aware that he has an enemy until yesterday?

179
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,360
- Exactly! - You both knew.

180
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,590
That Ichigo is such a person.

181
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,090
If you can solve this problem, if Ichigo solves it...

182
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,930
....you asked him for help without hesitation.

183
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,100
Let's go too Sado!

184
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:25,900
- We... We're coming too! - Yes!

185
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:30,530
Get in line! Get your back against the wall!

186
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:31,780
Hurry up!

187
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:34,860
We'll drill you another hole or two!

188
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,410
Stern Ritter "J"

189
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,870
Looks like this guy's head.

190
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,710
Look, are we really going to do it? I don't think we should.

191
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:47,040
Stupid, they're going to kill us anyway!

192
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:49,460
Yeah!

193
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:53,220
Silence please! Will you live or will you die?

194
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:58,300
We'll be holding a qualifier for the Hollows and Arrancars!

195
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,430
Ben...

196
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,930
I will kill everyone one by one, starting from the right!

197
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:07,480
If anyone says "I don't want to die"...

198
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,820
...or if there is someone who says "I want to join you"...

199
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:16,780
... beg as if he wanted to kneel and lick our shoes!

200
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,320
As long as you guys survive our attack...

201
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:24,830
... you are the chosen ones who are lucky, smart and strong!

202
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,960
I beg you, do not waste this opportunity!

203
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,750
If you're going to spare my life, it's solid—

204
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,630
Yes, of course it's not that easy!

205
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,800
Those who will apply must take the entrance exam!

206
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:44,640
This elimination will determine the person who is entitled to take that exam.

207
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:47,690
For those who don't understand my explanation...

208
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:50,730
... like this, like this....

209
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,860
Does the Commander have any thoughts on bringing Arrancar?

210
00:17:56,070 --> 00:18:00,870
There isn't any. He's not interested in Hueco Mundo anyway.

211
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:03,160
... dies like this!

212
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:12,840
- My commander! - Your time to say "commander" is too slow.

213
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:17,550
Very strange. I thought we confiscated all your swords.

214
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,890
Loly Aivirrne, aide-de-camp of our Lord Aizen!

215
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:24,040
Likewise Menoly Mallia!

216
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,810
We will not be defeated by servants like you!

217
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,510
- Do it. - Yes, sir!

218
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,890
- Shall we kill? - No.

219
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,280
His Majesty has asked us to bring in the brave fools.

220
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:47,270
These girls passed the exam. Punish them so they don't die.

221
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:53,370
However, I find it odd that Arrancars of this rank are adjutants.

222
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:56,300
So the person called Aizen isn't very smart.

223
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:01,340
Although, Tier Harribel, who took over the place after Aizen's death...

224
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:04,760
...he couldn't fall in love with His Majesty.

225
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:07,430
We shouldn't be surprised.

226
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:11,440
Who did I tell you not to overdo it?

227
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:18,780
May I ask who are you?

228
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:26,160
Talk back and forth about our Lord Harribel, come get to know us!

229
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:29,500
I guess the butlers are not given much information!

230
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:34,130
You took Sir Harribel while we were gone.

231
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:38,670
Don't get off your ass just because you beat those who call themselves Aizen's squire!

232
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:41,010
Mila Rose, Sung-Sun, Apacci (Three Beast)

233
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:53,520
What is this? The war has already begun!

234
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:57,320
- That's Tres Bestia's soul power! - What are you looking for there...

235
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,030
They take orders directly from His Holiness Harribel!

236
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,510
They are terribly powerful and frightening!

237
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:05,030
Moreover, they are always trying to take each other's lives like cannibalistic monsters!

238
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,990
If those insanely powerful monsters are here...

239
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,580
... get well soon to the enemy army!

240
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:15,210
- They're so scary, Ichigo! - I can't see ahead, stupid!

241
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:24,130
What, are you pulling me?

242
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,220
Stupid, I didn't open my mouth!

243
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,970
Delete that snot also!

244
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,480
Extraordinary.

245
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,480
You must not dive.

246
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:38,570
I have a suggestion for you. Surrender.

247
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,240
Are you stupid?

248
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,990
You are just empty talk!

249
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:50,910
If you surrender and join our army...

250
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:57,210
...you can work for Her Majesty with your only Tier Harribel.

251
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:02,130
Not now or later...

252
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,910
... you can't reach a greater happiness than this!

253
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:10,620
- What do you think we're a Four-Eyed Monkey? - Don't belittle us!

254
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:14,380
Oh, the negotiations failed?

255
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,810
I am in great disappointment.

256
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:20,260
1st Company Barracks, Meeting Room

257
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:23,030
I have given you the detailed report on the infiltration of the rebel army.

258
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:26,820
Thanks Akon. You can withdraw.

259
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:28,410
Yes, sir.

260
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:37,580
Yes, this time it's foreigners... Which we're nicknamed the rebel army for now.

261
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:43,230
With the invasion of this rebel army that calls itself the Wandenreich...

262
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:47,330
...the disappearance of the Hollows in the living world...

263
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:49,540
... interconnected.

264
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,720
Destroying multiple Hollows in the world of the living...

265
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:56,300
... caused serious imbalance of spirits.

266
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:02,020
It is quite possible that the world of the living and the Soul Society will perish.

267
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:06,400
destroying spirits...

268
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:17,160
Intelligent commanders have already understood.

269
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:20,500
Insurgent army...

270
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,140
…consist of Quincys.

271
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:15,740
The army is blowing their pipes.

272
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:19,700
It sounds like shooting stars.

273
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:23,370
The army stamps its feet. Like thunder.
