1
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:38,825
<i>The blue skies above are hopelessly clear</i>

2
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:43,997
<i>At my wit's end, I feel a growing frustration</i>

3
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:49,085
<i>As if to laugh at us hopeless cowards</i>

4
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:52,589
<i>Countless eyes stare at us</i>

5
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:59,012
<i>This soul of mine breaks again and again</i>

6
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:02,223
<i>All I can do is hold it tight</i>

7
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:08,479
<i>Until the day it turns to ash</i>

8
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,316
<i>I've absorbed all of this sorrow</i>

9
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:15,945
<i>It has shaped me, painted me</i>

10
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,781
<i>But that's how we got here, right?</i>

11
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:23,745
<i>One step at a time, just like breathing</i>

12
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,289
<i>These countless scars on my palm</i>

13
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,291
<i>That no longer fade</i>

14
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:32,045
<i>Are my badge, my story</i>

15
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:36,007
<i>I faced the fear and shred it to pieces</i>

16
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:39,093
<i>And let it walk beside me once more</i>

17
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:44,057
BLEACH: THOUSAND-YEAR BLOOD WAR

18
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,161
Hey, Shunsui!

19
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:08,373
How dare you enter my room
without my permission again!

20
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,375
I know, I'm sorry, my bad!

21
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,961
What kind of apology is that?!

22
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,587
Unforgivable!

23
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,089
I mean it!

24
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,424
I'm sorry I snuck in,
but I was surprised

25
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,760
you had a painting hanging,
Old Man Yama, so...

26
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,805
Damn old geezer...

27
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:28,810
That's a monster that appeared in
the Soul Society a long time ago.

28
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:33,147
It showed up when the Soul Society
was facing a crisis...

29
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,109
only to make things much worse.

30
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,613
It will never show up again.

31
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:44,367
But if it ever does...

32
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:46,744
<i>Then...</i>

33
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:10,852
<i>...I'll probably never
be back here again.</i>

34
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,817
Old Man Yama!!

35
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,842
You may have been
the head of the Soul Reapers...

36
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:48,806
but your demise was pitiful,
Shigekuni Yamamoto.

37
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,811
Let's go, Haschwalth.

38
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:54,854
Yes, sir.

39
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,867
Trying to show that you won't
let me get away even in death?

40
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,411
Pathetic.

41
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:14,415
Shigekuni Yamamoto,
you half-hearted fool.

42
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:18,753
You will never know
why I removed you

43
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,964
from being counted as
one of the five Special Threats.

44
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:26,969
Why didn't you restore
your left arm?

45
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:33,601
You could've done so if you'd
ordered that human girl to.

46
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:35,686
I know why.

47
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:39,148
You didn't want to exploit humans.

48
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,401
I know all about it.

49
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,737
Even during your battle with Aizen,

50
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,657
you were apprehensive about
getting Ichigo Kurosaki involved

51
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,826
because he was a human.

52
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:54,747
And even now, you stood before me
trying to carry the burden of

53
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:58,835
the Soul Society and the World
of the Living on your shoulders...

54
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,087
and you lost.

55
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:05,925
You've grown weak,
Shigekuni Yamamoto.

56
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:08,469
You used to be different.

57
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:12,640
The original Thirteen Court Guard
Squads that you founded

58
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,934
were Court Guards in name only.

59
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:18,062
They were a group of
savage killers.

60
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,691
But because of that,
they were a fearsome bunch.

61
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,026
And as their leader,
Shigekuni Yamamoto,

62
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:26,571
you were truly a beast
with the sword...

63
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,740
You used everything and anything
to slay an enemy.

64
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,368
The lives of the people,
including your own subordinates,

65
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:35,371
weighed only as much as ash to you.

66
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,169
But that all changed after
you exterminated us Quincies.

67
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,880
Upon gaining a peaceful world,

68
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,717
you people had more things
to protect and to love.

69
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,136
You've deteriorated into
a bunch of weaklings

70
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,304
who would hesitate to take action

71
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,890
to satisfy your pathetic
sense of justice and pride.

72
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:59,562
You died without realizing this,
so I'm going to tell you.

73
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,400
The Soul Society
is about to perish.

74
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:11,657
But the Thirteen Court Guard Squads
died with us a thousand years ago!

75
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,925
Time to finish this.

76
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,803
Inform every member
of the Stern Ritter.

77
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:39,602
Tell them to thoroughly...
crush the Soul Society!

78
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,240
- Wha—?!
- What's that?!

79
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,874
Advance, Soldat!

80
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,211
Rebel army foot soldiers!

81
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:07,838
Stand your ground!
We can take them—

82
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,576
Th-They're too strong...

83
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,828
M-Must get help...!

84
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,929
It's over.

85
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,151
Don't disappear!

86
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:12,695
Don't disappear!

87
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:16,907
Don't disappear!

88
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,705
Don't disappear!

89
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,460
Finally...

90
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:34,175
Sorry, I wanted to open it sooner
from this side, but...

91
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,763
things never seem...
to go the way we want...

92
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,932
Huh?
Who the hell are you?

93
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,061
I'm Stern Ritter, Shaz Domino!

94
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,812
The power I was given is—

95
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,405
Hey, hang in there!

96
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,674
The Spiritual Pressure
disappeared?!

97
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,050
What was that just now?!

98
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,817
Rukia and Renji...

99
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,861
were they still alive?

100
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:37,780
Yeah.

101
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,864
Don't worry.

102
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,533
They're alive.

103
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,744
I see...

104
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,038
Thank goodness...

105
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:53,796
I don't have... much time left.

106
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,760
Though I am a captain of
the Thirteen Court Guard Squads,

107
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,096
I was unable to defeat

108
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:05,766
the despicable people
who trampled on the Seireitei.

109
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:10,020
I led many squad members
to their deaths...

110
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:12,106
I brought sorrow

111
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,650
to their subordinates
and to their families...

112
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:20,322
Only to lose and die in disgrace.

113
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:23,159
I am deeply ashamed of this.

114
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,832
You, on the other hand,
are a human.

115
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:34,670
Not only should you not be
involved in this fight...

116
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:38,632
you should not even be here
in the first place.

117
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,719
So forgive me

118
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:48,809
for the terrible audacity
of asking you this final favor...

119
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,105
Please...

120
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:57,234
protect the Soul Society...

121
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,779
Ichigo Kurosaki...!

122
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,261
This Spiritual Pressure...

123
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,223
Yes, it must be Ichigo Kurosaki.

124
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:29,809
Shall I purge him?

125
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,311
No. Let's go.

126
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,033
You...!

127
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,685
<i>I didn't get a response.</i>

128
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,437
<i>That's fine.</i>

129
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,774
<i>That's the kind of man he is.</i>

130
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,778
<i>I know his answer
even if he didn't respond.</i>

131
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:32,580
I'm counting on you,
Ichigo Kurosaki...

132
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,891
Your Majesty, I'll handle this...

133
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,144
Ichigo Kurosaki...

134
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,688
I don't know how you did it,

135
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,399
but I'm impressed
you broke out of Quilge's "Jail."

136
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:05,738
But do you really intend to
fight me in that ragged state?

137
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,699
Are you the enemy leader?

138
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,452
The "enemy," huh?

139
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:13,621
I am.

140
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:15,748
But you could also say
that I'm not.

141
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,626
Cut the crap!

142
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:23,130
I'm asking if you're the one
who wrecked the Soul Society!

143
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,591
I did indeed.

144
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:29,845
Your Majesty...

145
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,723
As you can see, Haschwalth...

146
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,100
he leaves me with no choice.

147
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,144
I will crush him here.

148
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:21,647
Getsuga...

149
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:25,275
...tensho!

150
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,221
He should still be alive.

151
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,432
Carry him to the castle.

152
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:59,560
We'll revive him
and put him under my command.

153
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:01,854
Yes, Your Majesty.

154
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,031
<i>Impossible...!</i>

155
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:13,699
<i>Is that...</i>

156
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,243
<i>Blut Vene?!</i>

157
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:20,873
Your Majesty!

158
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:29,923
Should have known better...

159
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,634
What's that?

160
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:36,221
You think you won just because
you withstood a few of my attacks?

161
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,098
That's not what I meant.

162
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:48,609
I was right...

163
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,111
I wasn't imagining it.

164
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,238
What are you talking about?

165
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:59,328
It seems that using Quilge Opie
to keep you at bay was a mistake...

166
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:04,708
I should have used an Arrancar
instead of a trueborn Quincy...

167
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:09,713
Because of that, the memories
within your Spiritual Pressure

168
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:12,382
have awakened too soon.

169
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,637
You kept releasing
your Spiritual Pressure to the limit

170
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,014
while in contact with
Quilge's "Jail"

171
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,599
in order to destroy it.

172
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,978
The bits of Spiritual Pressure left
behind from this explosive release

173
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,689
mixed with some of
Quilge's Spiritual Pressure

174
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:29,608
as it returned to your body.

175
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,570
His Quincy Spiritual Pressure

176
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:37,950
slowly seeped into
the depths of your soul,

177
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,411
drawing out memories
within your Spiritual Pressure

178
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:43,038
from its core...

179
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:48,127
Quilge's "Jail" is meant to
restrain enemies...

180
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:52,297
It is unable to contain Quincies!

181
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,801
What... are you talking about?

182
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,470
Memories within
my Spiritual Pressure?

183
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,764
What's this about Quincies?

184
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:02,599
I see...

185
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:06,270
You don't know anything
about yourself, do you?

186
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,647
Not even about...

187
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:10,899
your own mother.

188
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:18,991
My plan was to take you back
and slowly re-educate you...

189
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,075
What are you—?

190
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:24,538
...but I no longer have the luxury
of doing that.

191
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,622
What are you—?

192
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,333
I've decided to force you
into submission

193
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,918
and drag you with me!

194
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:34,173
I said, what the hell
are you talking about?!

195
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,967
I'll tell you at the Wandenreich.

196
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,725
Qualkreis!

197
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:46,518
Now then...

198
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,646
Show me what you've got,
Ichigo Kurosaki!

199
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:59,990
Getsugatensho!

200
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,771
I will pierce you this time!

201
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:33,732
Don't assume you can evade it
with your Blut Vene!

202
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,692
My—

203
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:41,823
This is...

204
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:46,411
It is time, Your Majesty.

205
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,748
We've reached our limit for working
outside of the Schatten Bereich.

206
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,917
Please return to the Wandenreich.

207
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:53,460
Impossible.

208
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,128
We should still have time to—

209
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:01,301
Of course.
Sosuke Aizen...

210
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,929
This is one of his tricks.

211
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:06,223
During the few minutes
I was in contact with him,

212
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:09,643
he slightly altered my senses...

213
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:14,106
Haschwalth, you knew
but kept quiet, didn't you?

214
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,775
I figured it would be pointless
to try to stop you.

215
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:19,861
Well, it doesn't matter.

216
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:21,655
Let's go.

217
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:33,542
My time's up, so I'll be going now.

218
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,878
I guess you can't hear me anymore...

219
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,721
Stop!

220
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,889
You think I'd let you go?

221
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:51,768
After what you did
to the Soul Society...

222
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:54,146
there's no way I'd let you escape!

223
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,109
I said stop!

224
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:18,295
Farewell, Ichigo Kurosaki.

225
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:21,256
I'll come back for you again.

226
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:24,384
Heal your wounds and wait...

227
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:31,099
...my son... born in the dark...

228
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:45,113
<i>Everything we had left behind</i>

229
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,618
<i>Our breaths blending as mist</i>

230
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:53,872
<i>without form or expression</i>

231
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:58,168
<i>We lie buried as we glare
into the distance</i>

232
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:01,129
<i>I can't hear anything</i>

233
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:04,383
<i>I can't seem to cut anything</i>

234
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:06,968
<i>It feels like I'm sinking</i>

235
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,929
<i>Falling, falling</i>

236
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,013
<i>Touching</i>

237
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:13,517
<i>Eyes struck wide open</i>

238
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:16,853
<i>Something no one has ever seen</i>

239
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:23,151
<i>The furthest reaches are now visible to us</i>

240
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:27,155
<i>It cannot be undone
and cannot be stopped</i>

241
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,617
<i>This ensuing struggle</i>

242
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:35,414
<i>Whisk it away beyond
the ends of the earth</i>

243
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,541
<i>Along with our breaths</i>

244
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,042
<i>Take everything</i>

245
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:43,797
<i>Whisk it away beyond
the ends of the earth</i>

246
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,841
<i>Along with our futures</i>

247
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,717
<i>Along with our world</i>

248
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:52,055
<i>Something no one has ever seen</i>

249
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:58,645
<i>The furthest reaches are now
visible to us</i>

250
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:02,441
<i>Don't you know God's demand?</i>

251
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:05,944
<i>As we tear each other down</i>

252
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,955
<i>"I look to the heavens
and chase that star."</i>

253
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:22,752
<i>"Burned into my eyes,
the afterglow of its smoke."</i>
