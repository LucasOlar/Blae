00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:14,389
Captain?

2
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:17,976
I'm coming in, Captain.

3
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:20,687
Excuse me...

4
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:25,900
Captain...

5
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:27,610
If you were in here,
you could have at least answered—

6
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:28,820
Nanao...

7
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:34,284
We might have to say goodbye.

8
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:36,536
What?

9
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:39,664
"MESSAGE"

00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:44,753

AS HEAD CAPTAIN
AND SQUAD 1 CAPTAIN"

11
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:49,466
Give me a break...

12
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:15,950
<i>The blue skies above are hopelessly clear</i>

13
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:21,164
<i>At my wit's end, I feel a growing frustration</i>

14
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:26,002
<i>As if to laugh at us hopeless cowards</i>

15
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:29,756
<i>Countless eyes stare at us</i>

16
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:36,096
<i>This soul of mine breaks again and again</i>

17
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:39,307
<i>All I can do is hold it tight</i>

18
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:45,522
<i>Until the day it turns to ash</i>

19
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:48,399
<i>I've absorbed all of this sorrow</i>

20
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:53,029
<i>It has shaped me, painted me</i>

21
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:55,865
<i>But that's how we got here, right?</i>

22
00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:00,829
<i>One step at a time, just like breathing</i>

23
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,373
<i>These countless scars on my palm</i>

24
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,375
<i>That no longer fade</i>

25
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,129
<i>Are my badge, my story</i>

26
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,174
<i>I faced the fear and shred it to pieces</i>

27
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:16,261
<i>And let it walk beside me once more</i>

33
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:46,040
You failed, you moron!

34
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:48,418
Didn't your parents
teach you as a kid?

35
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,503
You're not supposed to
get out of a bath

36
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,255
until you've finished
counting up to 100!

37
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,841
What kind of parent
makes their kid count to 100

38
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,718
while their head's underwater?!

39
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,344
Quit your whining!

40
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,013
Kazuo!
Kazuhiro!

41
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,306
- Yessir!
- Come on, Bro!

42
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:04,017
Nothing personal, boy!

43
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,477
Damn you, boy!

44
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:07,729
It's Ichigo!

45
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,440
Wait.

46
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,823
What the hell was that for?!

47
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:20,116
You're healed.

48
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,331
If you weren't,
that would have killed you.

49
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,250
Look.
Your wounds are gone.

50
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,794
"KIRINDEN"

51
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:34,130
You finished
what you came here to do.

52
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:37,008
I'll prepare for you
to go to the next place.

53
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:38,593
The next place?

54
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,844
Wait up...!

55
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,181
I'm coming with you.

56
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,808
Renji!
Don't be silly.

57
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:46,935
You're still...

58
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,701
Well?

59
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,912
You didn't send me flying.

60
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:12,794
Fine.

61
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:15,546
If you can withstand my punch,
you're probably all right.

62
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:17,465
Go.

63
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,175
Thanks!

64
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,512
- Ready...
- Go!

65
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,893
Aren't there any other ways of
getting around this place?!

66
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:30,645
There they go...

67
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:32,939
Kazuo!
Kazuhiro!

68
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,192
Thanks for the hard work.

69
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:37,485
You can take those off now.

70
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:38,778
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

71
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:45,034
That was close...

72
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,120
If it weren't for
these protective bathing robes

73
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,496
made of super spiritual threads,

74
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:49,872
the extreme recovery would have

75
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:51,916
caused our bodies to erode
and rupture.

76
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:55,044
Yet those boys were able to soak in
Master Tenjiro's White Bone Hell

77
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:57,755
and Blood Pond Hell naked
as if it was nothing...

78
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,383
Unbelievable...

79
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:02,218
Yeah.

80
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,847
I saw their potential, but they
went beyond my expectations.

81
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,932
Especially that Ichigo kid.

82
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,811
When that punk took my strike,

83
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:15,857
he reflexively struck my fist
and fractured it.

84
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:17,859
My word...

85
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,862
People used to call me
"Lightning Fast Tenjiro"

86
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,613
for my Hoho skills...

87
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:26,659
Pretty sure I haven't
lost my touch yet...

88
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:30,705
That kid is really something...

89
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:34,667
I can see why the Soul King
is so into him...

90
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,129
<i>Two</i> lieutenants?!

91
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,672
CENTRAL 46
UNDERGROUND ASSEMBLY HALL Yes.

92
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,550
CENTRAL 46
UNDERGROUND ASSEMBLY HALL
Third Seat Okikiba
knows how to manage Squad 1...

93
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,134
CENTRAL 46
UNDERGROUND ASSEMBLY HALL
while Lieutenant Ise
knows how to handle me.

94
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:46,846
while Lieutenant Ise
knows how to handle me.

95
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:50,350
They will both fulfill the duties
of assisting me.

96
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:51,809
No!
This is unacceptable—

97
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:53,978
"The power to appoint someone
to lieutenant "

98
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:55,480
"lies with their squad captain."

99
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,984
Your people decided that, remember?

100
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:08,951
Now then, may I proceed with
my first task as head captain?

101
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:18,211
I intend to teach
Kenpachi Zaraki Zanjutsu.

102
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:19,629
- What?!
- What?!

103
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,925
Captain Kuchiki and the others
went to the Royal Palace,

104
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,344
but there's no guarantee
they'll return safely.

105
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:29,722
Captain Zaraki is
an important asset in battle.

106
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,183
We cannot leave him as he is now.

107
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:33,643
No!

108
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,853
If he becomes more powerful
than he is now,

109
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:38,606
we won't be able to stop him
if he revolts!

110
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,734
Have you forgotten
we urged Genryusai

111
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,070
to stop teaching him Kendo
after only a day?!

112
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,988
Then what do you suggest we do?

113
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:47,490
In its current state,

114
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,368
the Soul Society won't be able to
withstand the next invasion.

115
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:54,664
Will any of you be able to
protect yourselves?

116
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,967
It seems like
I've been given permission.

117
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,429
Come on in.

118
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,890
I'd like you to handle this matter
concerning Captain Zaraki.

119
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,691
Captain Unohana...

120
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:23,693
Or should I say...

121
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,029
The First Kenpachi...

122
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,615
Yachiru Unohana.

123
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,205
You go on the bottom!

124
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:40,126
<i>My</i> injuries were worse than yours!
So you go!

125
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:43,671
You're all healed up!
What are you, a wuss?

126
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,423
You're one to talk!
You damn—

127
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,343
Huh?

128
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:55,433
I couldn't have been found
at a worse time!

129
00:07:55,433 --> 00:08:02,523
GATONDEN - LANDING AREA
Good grief...

130
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,860
Crashing from that height
after my body just healed

131
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,320
- would have been awful.
- Hey, get back here!

132
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,238
It would only have been
awful for you.

133
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:12,950
I would have been able to
land safely using a breakfall.

134
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,118
What was that?

135
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:15,953
- I bet you can't do that, can you?
- Screw you...

136
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:18,039
Welcome!

137
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,459
I'm glad you came,
Ichigo and Renji!

138
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:24,045
Welcome to my Gatonden!

139
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,880
I'm gonna take good care
of both of you!

140
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,008
Seriously...!

141
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:33,054
Is there no one but idiots
in this place?!

142
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,892
Hup, hup,

143
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,478
hup, hup,
hup, hup, hup!

144
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,562
GATONDEN - KITCHEN AREA
hup, hup,
hup, hup, hup!

145
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:43,189
GATONDEN - KITCHEN AREA
Become tastier!

146
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,233
GATONDEN - KITCHEN AREA
And... here you go!

147
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:54,867
GATONDEN - MAIN HALL

148
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,661
When she said she was going to
take care of us...

149
00:08:56,869 --> 00:09:00,081
I thought she meant it as
whipping us into shape, but...

150
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,959
Looks like she really meant
what she said...

151
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,378
This is amazing!

152
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:06,837
Come on, let's eat!

153
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:09,757
I was super hungry!

154
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:10,841
Wait, you idiot!

155
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:14,011
There's no way she'd serve us
this food for no reason!

156
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,764
I bet it's an excuse to start
some ridiculous form of training!

157
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,099
My, oh, my...

158
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:23,145
Seems you grew up distrustful
thanks to Kisuke Urahara.

159
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,357
There's no need to worry!

160
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,110
This Gatonden is a palace of food.

161
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:34,115
My job is to ensure
your bellies are full!

162
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:39,245
And your job is to
stuff your bellies!

163
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,455
Now eat up!

164
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:44,166
I'm sure you must be
incredibly hungry!

165
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,881
- Let's dig in!
- Let's dig in!

166
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,351
Mm-hm.

167
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:04,520
What a healthy appetite.

168
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,023
I'll go make dessert!

169
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,735
So good!
I can't stop eating!

170
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,111
I can...

171
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:16,032
I'm finding some weird stuff
mixed in from time to time...

172
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:18,075
What the hell is this?

173
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,414
Unbelievable...

174
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:27,835
It looks grotesque,
but surprisingly tastes awesome!

175
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:30,171
It has an awesome texture
to it too!

176
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,381
And the way the awesome aroma
spreads through your mouth

177
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:33,883
is so awesome!

178
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:34,967
Stop.

179
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:38,387
Hearing your horrible food critique
is ruining my meal.

180
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,480
What?
Are you done already?

181
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,939
I can still eat more.

182
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,859
You idiot!
I can totally keep going!

183
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,944
I'm just taking a break!

184
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:04,455
Hey, Renji...

185
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,918
Should we... really be doing this?

186
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,005
Everyone in the Seireitei

187
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,841
is training right now
to prepare for the next battle...

188
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:19,887
While we're here taking baths,
eating food,

189
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:21,806
and just fooling around...

190
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,684
Will doing this really...

191
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,020
make us strong enough
for the next battle?

192
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,734
Are you really that dumb?

193
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,987
- What?!
- We were both injured in battle.

194
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,990
So we took a bath
to heal our wounds.

195
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,951
Once our wounds healed,
we got hungry.

196
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,286
That's why we're eating now.

197
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,580
It all makes perfect sense.

198
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:48,916
We are building up our strength

199
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,168
to prepare for the tough training
that lies ahead.

200
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:53,295
Wow...

201
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:55,756
You actually make a good point
once in a while.

202
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:56,924
Shut up!

203
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,926
If you agree, then eat more!

204
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,344
You can still keep going,
can't you?!

205
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:01,637
Of course, I can!

206
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,433
I'm going to eat more than you!

207
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,976
Dream on!
I'm going to—

208
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:11,147
Renji is right!

209
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,483
I guess it's only natural
for a lieutenant to figure it out!

210
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:18,487
You fully understood
what I was saying!

211
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,158
That's right!

212
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,951
What we're doing right now

213
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:27,830
is no different than getting ready
for any other training.

214
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:29,790
The only difference is,

215
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,793
it's being done
on a Soul King scale.

216
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:37,590
Our rituals are packed with
the Soul King's power

217
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,926
and the million-year history
of the Soul Society.

218
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:44,221
It's on a whole other level
from the healing and diet

219
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:46,182
that you know in the Seireitei.

220
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,018
Now focus on rebuilding your body.

221
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,145
So you don't die
in the next palace.

222
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:55,733
Now that you understand,
have some dessert!

223
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,027
Wh...

224
00:12:58,402 --> 00:12:59,987
- Who are you?!
- Who are you?!

225
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:02,823
Oh, this?

226
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:05,534
I use up all my Spiritual Pressure
when I cook.

227
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:09,121
So after I'm done cooking,
I always lose a lot of weight.

228
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:13,209
"GRAIN KING" - KIRIO HIKIFUNE

229
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,088
Ichigo, Renji.

230
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,007
Be careful out there.

231
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,803
Remember how I told you
our Ritual was

232
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,430
packed with the history
of the Soul Society?

233
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,809
Every one of us in Squad Zero

234
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:33,270
has created something
in the Soul Society...

235
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,482
And those who are
recognized as being

236
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,318
the history of the Soul Society
itself by the Soul King

237
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,986
are allowed to join our squad.

238
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:45,032
What I've created
was a temporary soul

239
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,284
and the technology
to place it into a body.

240
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:52,832
The concept of Gikon did not exist
until I created a temporary soul.

241
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:58,420
And part of that concept was
applied to create Soul Candies.

242
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,800
The essence of Gikon
is to increase one's level of power

243
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,803
by placing a completely foreign
Spiritual Pressure

244
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,555
into your own body.

245
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:10,432
The food you ate
was filled with that essence.

246
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:13,394
Your bodies should now be
containing Spiritual Pressure

247
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,771
that is nothing like
you've felt before.

248
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:19,483
If you can sense that
even a little, then good.

249
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,235
That said...

250
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,112
I still want you
to go with caution.

251
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:29,743
The one in the next palace
is totally unpredictable.

252
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,998
Your next stop is Hoohden,
where Oh-Etsu Nimaiya resides...

253
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:38,043
He is the man
who created Zanpakuto.

254
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:03,235
THE CENTRAL UNDERGROUND
GREAT PRISON

255
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:16,165
LOWEST LEVEL - "MUKEN"

256
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:33,098
This is a rather grandiose stage,
isn't it?

257
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:37,311
I'm surprised you were able to
get permission to use this place.

258
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,189
It was the Head Captain's orders.

259
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:45,152
As its name suggests,
Muken is completely closed off...

260
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,948
and infinitely large...

261
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:53,035
Thus, it was decided that
this was the only place

262
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:56,121
suitable for you
to freely swing your sword.

263
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,540
Otherwise,

264
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:03,837
they never would have allowed us
non-criminals to enter this space.

265
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,634
"Non-criminals"?

266
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,219
Look who's talking.

267
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:14,807
If you and I weren't powerful,
we'd just be ordinary criminals!

268
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:26,485
Right now, you have no power.

269
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,445
I suggested this place

270
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:31,865
because I felt
you would fit in perfectly here.

271
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,827
Yeah, that's what I figured.

272
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:37,246
Fine by me.

273
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:40,207
Win as a captain,
or lose as a criminal...

274
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,002
Doesn't matter if I live or die
fighting you.

275
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,170
It's still going to be
an eternal hell.

276
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,966
You're quite talkative today,
aren't you?

277
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,971
I like you better
when you're quiet.

278
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,932
Whenever I hear your voice,

279
00:16:57,641 --> 00:17:02,980
the single scar you gave me
begins to ache.

280
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,523
Shut up.

281
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,900
Don't think you're the only one...

282
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,944
who's got an aching scar!

283
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,952
Yachiru Unohana...

284
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:18,996
The original
Thirteen Court Guard Squads,

285
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,706
said to be
the strongest in history...

286
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,709
She served as
the captain of Squad 11

287
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,795
and created the basis
of what Squad 11 is today.

288
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:30,924
Before being appointed as a captain
by Old Man Yama,

289
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:34,678
she was the most notorious criminal
in the history of the Soul Society.

290
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:38,057
To show her mastery
of countless styles

291
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,934
and her complete proficiency
of the blade,

292
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,229
she gave herself the name
"Yachiru (Eight Thousand Styles)"...

293
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:51,653
I'm sorry I called it
a Zanjutsu lesson...

294
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:57,451
Once you and Captain Zaraki
cross blades...

295
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,749
one of you will have to die.

296
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,627
I knew that...

297
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:18,472
"TO ISANE"

298
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:37,950
Kenny...

299
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:41,703
Captain Unohana...

300
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:17,406
I commend you for removing
your eyepatch from the start.

301
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:22,619
But even if you remove it,
that is the extent of your power.

302
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,338
So weak...

303
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,807
I can't believe someone
swinging a sword with one arm,

304
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:46,602
wouldn't make use
of their other arm...

305
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:50,939
I can't imagine
you're enjoying this fight.

306
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,317
And what about you?

307
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:56,278
To think you'd resort to using
a cheap trick like this

308
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,238
to wound me.

309
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:01,992
You've changed quite a bit...

310
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,914
...from the person I admired!

311
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:10,542
How dare you admire
the enemy amid battle!

312
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:26,725
I haven't changed at all.

313
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:30,312
But when I last fought you...

314
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:35,067
I simply did not have the leeway to
use such cheap tricks against you.

315
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:37,986
Are you saying...

316
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,822
that I've gotten weaker?

317
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,915
I admired you...

318
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,460
Trees, bugs, people...

319
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,796
No matter what I cut,
it was all the same.

320
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:57,339
It was boring...

321
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:01,760
It was no different from swinging
a sword while alone in the dark.

322
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:06,848
Fighting you
was the first time I felt fear.

323
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:10,894
I felt the joy of battle
for the first time.

324
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:14,106
I wanted to fight just like you.

325
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,817
But you're saying...

326
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:27,494
...I'm going to die here...
without ever beating you?!

327
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,682
Damn it...

328
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,898
What's the matter?

329
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:59,860
You looked like you spaced out
for a moment.

330
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:02,404
Shut up!

331
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,740
<i>What just happened...?</i>

332
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,700
<i>I swore I was...</i>

333
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:08,744
<i>Screw it.</i>

334
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,955
<i>I don't have time to think.</i>

335
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,791
<i>Right now,
I need to focus on this battle!</i>

336
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:19,755
<i>Kenpachi Zaraki...</i>

337
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:21,923
<i>You will not die.</i>

338
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,343
<i>Each time you're on
the verge of death,</i>

339
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,469
<i>you grow stronger.</i>

340
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:30,015
<i>That is the flaw
you put upon yourself.</i>

341
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,600
<i>And it is also...</i>

342
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,436
<i>my sin.</i>

343
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:45,405
<i>Everything we had left behind</i>

344
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:49,701
<i>Our breaths blending as mist</i>

345
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:54,164
<i>without form or expression</i>

346
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:58,460
<i>We lie buried as we glare
into the distance</i>

347
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:01,421
<i>I can't hear anything</i>

348
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:04,674
<i>I can't seem to cut anything</i>

349
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,177
<i>It feels like I'm sinking</i>

350
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:09,137
<i>Falling, falling</i>

351
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:10,222
<i>Touching</i>

352
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:13,725
<i>Eyes struck wide open</i>

353
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:17,062
<i>Something no one has ever seen</i>

354
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:23,443
<i>The furthest reaches are now visible to us</i>

355
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:27,447
<i>It cannot be undone
and cannot be stopped</i>

356
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:30,784
<i>This ensuing struggle</i>

357
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:35,664
<i>Whisk it away beyond
the ends of the earth</i>

358
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:37,833
<i>Along with our breaths</i>

359
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,334
<i>Take everything</i>

360
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:44,089
<i>Whisk it away beyond
the ends of the earth</i>

361
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:46,133
<i>Along with our futures</i>

362
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,009
<i>Along with our world</i>

363
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:52,347
<i>Something no one has ever seen</i>

364
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:58,728
<i>The furthest reaches are now
visible to us</i>

365
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,814
<i>Don't you know God's demand?</i>

366
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,732
<i>Don't you know God's demand?</i>

367
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:06,236
<i>As we tear each other down</i>

368
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,204
<i>"Battle is everything."</i>
