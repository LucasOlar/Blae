1
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:17,017
I'm going.

2
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:19,769
Hey, Ichigo!

3
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:23,732
How do you intend
to get back there?

4
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:31,406
Right on time!

5
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:32,991
Let's go.

6
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,912
Looking good there.

7
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,889
You should be able to
do this now, Ichigo.

8
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:32,759
You're the one.

9
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,615
Nice.

10
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:57,700
Come on up.

11
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:01,037
I'll personally reforge it for you.

12
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,854
<i>The blue skies above are hopelessly clear</i>

13
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:32,026
<i>At my wit's end, I feel
a growing frustration</i>

14
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:36,865
<i>As if to laugh at us hopeless cowards</i>

15
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:40,618
<i>Countless eyes stare at us</i>

16
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:46,958
<i>This soul of mine breaks again and again</i>

17
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,170
<i>All I can do is hold it tight</i>

18
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:56,426
<i>Until the day it turns to ash</i>

19
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,304
<i>I've absorbed all of this sorrow</i>

20
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:04,017
<i>It has shaped me, painted me</i>

21
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,853
<i>But that's how we got here, right?</i>

22
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:11,774
<i>One step at a time, just like breathing</i>

23
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,319
<i>These countless scars on my palm</i>

24
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,321
<i>That no longer fade</i>

25
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:20,074
<i>Are my badge, my story</i>

26
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:24,037
<i>I faced the fear and shred it to pieces</i>

27
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:27,122
<i>And let it walk beside me once more</i>

- Yes, sir!

32
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,613
Captain Hitsugaya!

33
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:01,366
What brings you here?

34
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,285
I'd like for you to train me.

35
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:05,245
What?

36
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:07,288
My Bankai was stolen.

37
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,208
If I'm to fight
using only Zanjutsu,

38
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,180
then I must retrain myself
from the basics.

39
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:19,550
<i>After the battle against Aizen,
I thoroughly refined my Bankai...</i>

40
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,595
<i>until it could be called
a true Bankai.</i>

41
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:26,432
<i>However, my Bankai was stolen...</i>

42
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:28,893
<i>I must let go of what's been lost.</i>

43
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,813
<i>There's no time to be dreaming
of getting it back.</i>

44
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,024
<i>Right now, I need to look ahead.</i>

RUKON DISTRICT - OUTSKIRTS

00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,272
Why have you brought me here?

47
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:44,200
Shuhei,
I want you to master Bankai.

48
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:45,576
What?

49
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,705
My Bankai wasn't stolen this time,

50
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,308
but there's no guarantee
it won't happen the next time.

51
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,626
The more Soul Reapers
who can do Bankai, the better.

52
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,131

55
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,262
W-Wait, Kuna!

56
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:05,638
You better watch out.

57
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,099
Mashiro is strong
when she's Hollowfied.

58
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:12,436
I think mastering your Bankai
is the only way you won't die.

59
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,938
Captain Muguruma,
you can't expect me to just...

60
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,024
Hi-yah!

61
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:21,237
You idiot.

62
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,905
I told you to watch out.

63
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,615
That's right!

64
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:28,870
A lieutenant shouldn't disobey
a <i>super</i> lieutenant!

65
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,248
I hope you're not thinking
she won't kill you for real.

66
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:35,084
I'm not soft like Tosen was.

67
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:41,299
Hold on, Captain Muguruma...

68
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:45,553
I've always looked up to
and respected you.

69
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:47,764
But still...

70
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:53,394
you have no right
to bad-mouth Captain Tosen!

DEPARTMENT OF

72
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:02,945
DEPARTMENT OF R&D -
CONTROL ROOM Hey.

73
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:04,197
Mr. Akon!

74
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:06,198
Is it okay for you
to walk around already?!

75
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,951
Of course not.
It still hurts.

76
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:12,455
But I'm not the type to be
lying around in bed all day.

77
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:14,623
Where's the Captain?

78
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:15,708
About that...

79
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:19,086
He's been cooped up
in his office with the Lieutenant

80
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,339
ever since the Quincy attack.

81
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:23,758
He hasn't come out since then?

82
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,093
That's right.

83
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:38,271
Is something wrong?

84
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:41,149
The Captain has been cooped up
for more than 24 hours,

85
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,902
yet the Surveillance Bugs
remain inactive.

86
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,696
- That's never happened before.
- What?

87
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,658
Either a crisis has occurred
within the Captain's office

88
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:52,119
or he's conducting experiments that
he doesn't want anyone to see

89
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,830
through the Surveillance Bugs.

90
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:56,332
At any rate,
I'm going to take a look.

91
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,086
Mr. Akon, what is that...?

92
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:03,004
It's a camera I planted
in the Captain's office.

93
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,549
- But that's—!
- Not now.

94
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,092
I'm getting a visual!

95
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,968
<i>It will use its existing tissue
as a host</i>

96
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,553
<i>to give birth
to a new Ashisogijizo...</i>

97
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,180
What the hell is that...?!

98
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,226
What the hell is
the Captain creating?!

99
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,440
"OMAEDA" Big Brother!

100
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:24,318
Where are you, Big Brother?!

101
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:26,904
Big Brother!

102
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:31,658
Big Brother!
Please play ball with me!

103
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,327
No!

104
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,167
Wait!
Don't cry, Mareyo!

105
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:43,463
I... umm...

106
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,216
Want to play <i>kemari</i>?

107
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,968
Yes!

108
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,179
Here goes!

109
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:54,974
Wow!
That's amazing, Big Brother!

110
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:57,642
- I guess the Captain
- Look at it go!

111
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:00,646
Decided not to take me with her...

112
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,240
Who's there?

113
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:15,912
It's been a long time, Great Elder.

114
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,707
Sajin, huh?

115
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:23,419
You've got some nerve
coming back here.

116
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:26,297
What do you want, Sajin?

117
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:32,470
Great Elder, I have come to learn
our clan's secret technique.

118
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,270
Don't be ridiculous.

119
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,106
You shamelessly donned
a hat and armor

120
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:47,359
and pretended to be human

121
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,906
because you were embarrassed
by our clan's appearance.

122
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,326
How dare you make demands of me.

123
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:56,619
Please take a look.

124
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,913
I no longer wear a hat...

125
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,708
The world has changed
in the past few decades.

126
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:07,170
I sense that the world
has reached a point

127
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:10,049
where our clan
can live out in the open.

128
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,969
And that very world
is currently under threat!

129
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,972
Shut your mouth!

130
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:19,641
You have it all wrong.

131
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:22,061
The world will never perish.

132
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:26,607
Only the bearer of it will change.

133
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,276
Our clan won't change.

134
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,152
Regardless of whoever
claims the world,

135
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:34,030
we will continue
to live in the shadows.

136
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:36,450
I'm telling you we can change that!

137
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,120
We <i>must</i> change it

138
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,452
for the sake of our children,
and our grandchildren.

139
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,291
It won't change.

140
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,626
Nor is there a need to.

141
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:51,716
Whoever the world belongs to,
it's none of our concern.

142
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:53,050
Great Elder!

143
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,472
Don't you understand, Sajin?

144
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:04,311
I'm telling you not to disrupt
the peace we have.

145
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:07,273
If you cannot do that...

146
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:11,068
I shall crush you.

147
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,113
Bring it on!

148
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:28,752
This is why Hoohden
was built on a cliff!

149
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,630
HOOHDEN - FORGE
This is why Hoohden
was built on a cliff!

150
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:35,301
A Bankai cannot be reforged
without all these waters.

151
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,263
Now brace yourself, Ichigo.

152
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:44,435
This is where you
and your Zanpakuto, Zangetsu...

153
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,022
must say goodbye!

154
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:10,335
Come on, everybody!
Let's begin!

155
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:14,924
Welcome to my show!

156
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,425
- Yessir!
- Yessir...

157
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,349
The Nimaiya Bodyguards are here!

158
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:29,230
Why are you just
standing there staring?

159
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,733
When I said "everybody,"
that includes you too...

160
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,193
Asauchi.

161
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,787
What is going on...?!

162
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,331
Let's party time!

163
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,551
Ready!

164
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:01,345
NIMAIYA BODYGUARD -
NONOMI NOMINO

165
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:02,888
All right!

NIMAIYA BODYGUARD -
MERA HIUCHIGASHIMA

167
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:14,984
I hate this.

168
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,652
It's such a hassle...

169
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:20,448
I can't believe I'm being dragged
into this mess again...

170
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,700
NIMAIYA BODYGUARD -
TOKIE TONOKAWA

171
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,743
What a horrible life...

172
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,536
Stop complaining, Ms. Tokie!

173
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,998
This is our job, remember?

174
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,124
Here goes!

175
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,668
There!

176
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,296
Got you!

177
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,048
NIMAIYA BODYGUARD -
HASUKA HASHIHARA

00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:55,566
Now then...

180
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,444
Let's get started.

181
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,122
What are you thinking
as you see this, Go-Ichi?

182
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:14,376
Well, it's much brighter now,

183
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:17,505
so maybe you should have
left your sunglasses on...

184
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,673
You fool!

185
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,468
If I kept my sunglasses on...

186
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:25,888
I wouldn't be able to see
the color of the flames!

187
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,850
Have you figured it out, Go-Ichi?

188
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,563
The reason why
this Asauchi turned white

189
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,566
the moment it touched you...

190
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:39,860
No...

191
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,987
I bet this is what
crossed your mind...

192
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,491
"It reminds me of
the Hollow within me."

193
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:52,414
That's right.
This guy <i>is</i> the Hollow within you.

194
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:58,546
That Asauchi became the catalyst
to draw this Zanpakuto out.

195
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:06,095
I'm saying that this Hollow
is your Zanpakuto, Go-Ichi!

196
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:13,477
Aizen created the Hollow
known as "White"

197
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:17,106
by layering countless
Soul Reaper souls.

198
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:22,027
Oddly enough, that is the same
method I use to create my Asauchi.

199
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:25,029
That Hollow entered your body

200
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:29,118
and melded with
your natural Soul Reaper powers...

201
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:32,204
becoming your Zanpakuto.

202
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,373
Hold on a second...

203
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,667
are you saying that
Old Man Zangetsu is...

204
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,168
I told you, didn't I?

205
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:42,798
That you will be saying goodbye
to "Zangetsu."

206
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:46,260
Yes, you already know...

207
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:51,514
about the man
who has been pretending to be

208
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:54,768
your Zanpakuto within your soul!

209
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,072
Old Man... Zangetsu...

210
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:12,202
Go-Ichi, you know that man.

211
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:13,495
Of course, I do...

212
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,749
- He's Zangetsu—
- No, look closer.

213
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:24,256
You've seen that man up close
with your own eyes quite recently...

214
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:27,301
as the enemy who destroyed
the Soul Society!

215
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,347
That man is <i>not</i>
your Soul Reaper powers.

216
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:36,852
He is your <i>Quincy</i> powers
taking the form of...

217
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:40,397
Yhwach from a thousand years ago!

218
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:47,780
<i>I've been trying
not to think about it...</i>

219
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:50,699
<i>That day,</i>

220
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,702
<i>when I first confronted him...</i>

221
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:58,082
<i>I felt as if I was drawn there.</i>

222
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:03,712
<i>I had been trying
not to ask myself why.</i>

223
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:07,882
<i>About why I was able to
go straight to him</i>

224
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:09,343
<i>without knowing anything...</i>

225
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:13,138
<i>Or why I thought he was
the most important enemy...</i>

226
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,142
<i>And finally...</i>

227
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,562
<i>why the first time I saw him...</i>

228
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,608
<i>he reminded me of someone I know.</i>

229
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:37,871
Zangetsu!

230
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:49,091
What is going on, Zangetsu?

231
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,052
It's just as you heard.

232
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:53,846
And...

233
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,598
I am not Zangetsu.

234
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,323
Then you really are... Yhwach?

235
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,826
Are you really...

236
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:17,911
not Zangetsu?

237
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:22,791
I am the source of the Quincy power
within you.

238
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:27,045
I am Yhwach, yet I am not.

239
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,338
I don't get it!

240
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,799
Are you my enemy
or are you my ally?!

241
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,677
Was everything
you said to me a lie?!

242
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,554
Answer me!

243
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:42,186
I'm not an enemy or an ally.

244
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,939
But there were no lies
in my words to you.

245
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:49,109
Except for the name I told you.

246
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:54,073
Ichigo, I know you've seen it.

247
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:59,077
Whenever I taught you
how to use your Zanpakuto,

248
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:02,206
I always had help from the Hollow...

249
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:07,336
Whenever you couldn't handle
your Zanpakuto's power...

250
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:11,298
When you were truly in danger
of losing your life...

251
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,885
The one that saved your life...

252
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,470
was not me,

253
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,139
but the Hollow.

254
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:23,811
I didn't want you to become
a Soul Reaper.

255
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:27,188
That is why I suppressed
your true power,

256
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,148
which had not fully matured...

257
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:33,028
and became the center
of your power.

258
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,280
- Why?
- "Why"?

259
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:40,077
I wished to keep you
far from danger, and from conflict.

260
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:42,204
What is there to question?

261
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,040
If you became a Soul Reaper,

262
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:48,043
you would be dragged into battle
whether you wanted to or not.

263
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,337
You would get hurt...

264
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:52,548
You would suffer...

265
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:57,177
And eventually,
I would have to kill you...

266
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:00,222
with my own hands.

267
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:14,153
I couldn't let you become
a Soul Reaper.

268
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,531
If you did,
I would have to kill you.

269
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,200
That's what I thought...

270
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:25,122
However, you chose the path
of a Soul Reaper.

271
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:29,041
You were given an opportunity
and honed your strength...

272
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,960
You suffered and got hurt,

273
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:34,089
yet still continued to travel down
that path of your own free will.

274
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:41,430
As I watched you, I could almost
hear my heart wavering.

275
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,684
Eventually, rather than try to
keep you away

276
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,187
from the Soul Reapers,

277
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:52,357
my heart leaned towards
supporting your decision.

278
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:57,404
And now, I stand here...

279
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:04,995
feeling the joy of stepping away
from you...

280
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:09,249
Ichigo... you've become strong.

281
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,214
I've been able to see your growth
right by your side.

282
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:20,177
Nothing could make me happier.

283
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,056
I am satisfied.

284
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,726
W-Wait, Zangetsu!

285
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:29,603
I still—!

286
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:44,743
Ichigo...

287
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:50,039
What you've been using is merely
a fragment of your power

288
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,876
that I couldn't suppress.

289
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:58,674
You can now fight
with your own power.

290
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,593
Take it.

291
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:05,264
That is your true Zanpakuto...

292
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,058
<i>That</i> is Zangetsu.

293
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,691
<i>You're right.
There were no lies...</i>

294
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,360
<i>Not in his words...</i>

295
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,237
<i>Or in your words...</i>

296
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:25,242
<i>You used a Quincy's shadow
to help me.</i>

297
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,038
<i>You used a Quincy's blood
to stop mine.</i>

298
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,833
<i>And you lent me
the power of a Quincy</i>

299
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:36,086
<i>to help me win when I was weak.</i>

300
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:39,548
<i>Zangetsu...</i>

301
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,051
<i>I don't care who you are.</i>

302
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,138
<i>You might try to deny it, but...</i>

303
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,140
<i>You...</i>

304
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:49,766
<i>and him...</i>

305
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,436
<i>are both Zangetsu to me.</i>

306
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:56,148
<i>Let's just agree to that, okay?</i>

307
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,233
<i>Zangetsu...</i>

308
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,872
What are you doing?!
Your hands will...

309
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,166
It's all good.

310
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,501
Right, Go-Ichi?

311
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,670
I was just thinking the same thing.

312
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:25,218
That it would be complete
once you poured your soul into it.

313
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,889
Now pull it out, Go-Ichi!

314
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:33,477
That's your Zanpakuto!

315
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,782
- The sea...
- It evaporated!

316
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:48,742
Well, Go-Ichi?

317
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,703
Think you can get along?

318
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:56,833
With those Zangetsu...

319
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,586
<i>Two</i>...Zanpakuto?!

320
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,047
Amazing!

321
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:05,133
Yup.
They were both real.

322
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:09,137
<i>Zangetsu...</i>

323
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:13,600
<i>I won't ask you to lend me
your strength anymore.</i>

324
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,063
<i>I won't tell you
to stay out of my way, either.</i>

325
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:23,485
<i>And I won't ask you guys
to fight alongside me.</i>

326
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,659
<i>I'll fight on my own.</i>

327
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,500
<i>Thank you, Zangetsu.</i>

328
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,129
<i>You are...</i>

329
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:43,755
<i>me.</i>

330
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:54,349
You've returned, Haschwalth.

331
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,143
And the subject?

332
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:58,854
Right here.

333
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,406
Welcome...

334
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,700
Uryu Ishida.

335
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:17,789
Now, let us fight together...

336
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:21,293
my son.
