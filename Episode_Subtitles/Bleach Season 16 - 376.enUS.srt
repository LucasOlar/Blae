1
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:14,264
<i>It happened again!</i>

2
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:19,144
<i>I blacked out again.</i>

3
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:25,775
<i>How many times was that?</i>

4
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:30,613
<i>I black out amid battle,
again and again...</i>

5
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:32,907
<i>only to find myself
back where I left off.</i>

6
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:43,209
<i>This brings back memories.</i>

7
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:45,462
<i>I always enjoy my battles,</i>

8
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:48,048
<i>but not to the point
where I'd lose myself</i>

9
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,091
<i>or have blackouts
in the middle of it.</i>

10
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:53,011
<i>That happened only once...</i>

11
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:57,432
<i>That day I fought you.</i>

12
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:22,957
<i>The blue skies above are hopelessly clear</i>

13
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:28,171
<i>At my wit's end, I feel a growing frustration</i>

14
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:33,009
<i>As if to laugh at us hopeless cowards</i>

15
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:36,763
<i>Countless eyes stare at us</i>

16
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:43,103
<i>This soul of mine breaks again and again</i>

17
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:46,272
<i>All I can do is hold it tight</i>

18
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:52,529
<i>Until the day it turns to ash</i>

19
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,406
<i>I've absorbed all of this sorrow</i>

20
00:01:55,532 --> 00:02:00,036
<i>It has shaped me, painted me</i>

21
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:02,872
<i>But that's how we got here, right?</i>

22
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:07,836
<i>One step at a time, just like breathing</i>

23
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,463
<i>These countless scars on my palm</i>

24
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:12,465
<i>That no longer fade</i>

25
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:16,219
<i>Are my badge, my story</i>

26
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:20,181
<i>I faced the fear and shred it to pieces</i>

27
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:23,268
<i>And let it walk beside me once more</i>

28
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:27,939
BLEACH: THOUSAND-YEAR BLOOD WAR

29
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:51,671
RUKON DISTRICT -
SEVERAL HUNDRED YEARS AGO
Captain!

30
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,173
It's just not possible...

31
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,300
No matter how much we search
the Rukon District...

32
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,012
I doubt we'll find anyone
strong enough to satisfy you.

33
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,849
I'm impressed you figured out
my true intent...

34
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:06,269
Cutting down gangs from
the Rukon District won't

35
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,897
make much difference in preserving
the peace in the Seireitei.

36
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:14,819
The size of this pile of bodies is
the size of your dissatisfaction!

37
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:17,405
That pile...

38
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,574
How long has it been there?

39
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:22,702
Huh?
This wasn't your doing?

40
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,792
Who's that kid?

41
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:33,796
<i>I was bored...</i>

42
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:36,549
<i>With the sword.
With fighting.</i>

43
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:41,221
<i>And so I wandered around
in search of a foe</i>

44
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,097
<i>who could please my sword.</i>

45
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:48,853
<i>That's probably why our swords
drew us two weary souls together.</i>

46
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,064
<i>Such bliss...</i>

47
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:53,983
<i>I hadn't expected this.</i>

48
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:55,818
<i>I never would have thought that</i>

49
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,987
<i>I could experience
such unparalleled joy</i>

50
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:00,615
<i>by crossing blades with a child...</i>

51
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,493
<i>But I never thought</i>

52
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:08,164
<i>that child would place shackles
on himself because of our battle.</i>

53
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:13,962
<i>I landed one!</i>

54
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:18,049
<i>Before, I could only react.
But now, I can counter it.</i>

55
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:20,927
<i>It's almost as if each time
I experience a blackout...</i>

56
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,012
<i>I wake up feeling reborn!</i>

57
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:27,976
<i>Kenpachi Zaraki, you probably
have not realized this...</i>

58
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:30,311
<i>That you are unconsciously</i>

59
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:35,400
<i>restraining your powers
while in battle.</i>

60
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:41,906
<i>Do you know why you narrowly lost
your battle with Ichigo Kurosaki?</i>

61
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,246
<i>Do you know why you narrowly won
your battle with Nnoitora Gilga?</i>

62
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,165
<i>Was it because they were strong...?</i>

63
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,876
<i>I'm sure that's how it seemed
to the others.</i>

64
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:57,380
<i>But I knew that wasn't the case.</i>

65
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:04,470
<i>In each instance, you suppressed
your power to the limit.</i>

66
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:11,227
<i>During that battle, we both
experienced unparalleled joy.</i>

67
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,022
<i>The only difference was that</i>

68
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:19,360
<i>you learned the joy
of fighting on the edge.</i>

69
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,488
<i>That is my sin.</i>

70
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,074
<i>You must have been ecstatic.</i>

71
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,243
<i>Everyone around you was weak.</i>

72
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,829
<i>You had no enemies
you could test your sword against.</i>

73
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:36,627
<i>I was the first foe you encountered
who could rival your power.</i>

74
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:38,671
<i>However...</i>

75
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,966
<i>I was weaker than you.</i>

76
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,595
<i>I was the first person in your life
you could call a foe.</i>

77
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:48,014
<i>You believed that if you lost me,</i>

78
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,559
<i>you would never experience
the joy of battle ever again...</i>

79
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:53,853
<i>You wanted to bring yourself
down to my level,</i>

80
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,647
<i>so little by little,
you unconsciously</i>

81
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:03,404
<i>began to suppress your power
into a deep, dark place.</i>

82
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:05,865
<i>I was devastated.</i>

83
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:10,495
<i>My weakness drove you
to suppress your power.</i>

84
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:14,040
<i>But one day, I noticed something.</i>

85
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:18,503
<i>Each time you flirt with death
against a powerful foe,</i>

86
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,005
<i>you start to break your shackles</i>

87
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:23,383
<i>and return to the person
you used to be...</i>

88
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,387
<i>I am strong.</i>

89
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,347
<i>Stronger than anyone besides you.</i>

90
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:33,226
<i>That is why I will kill you.</i>

91
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,270
<i>Even if it takes a hundred
or a thousand tries.</i>

92
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,233
<i>That is why I will heal you.</i>

93
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,819
<i>Again and again...</i>

94
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:47,323
<i>Until you return
to what you really are.</i>

95
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,410
<i>From there...</i>

96
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,954
<i>you will surpass me
and reach even greater heights...</i>

97
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,580
<i>Do it!</i>

98
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:05,508
You thought I was dead, didn't you?

99
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:07,885
Guess again.

100
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:15,685
You, of all people, should know
the reason why I mastered Kaido.

101
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:20,690
Bankai...

102
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,363
Minazuki.

103
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,874
Playtime is over...

104
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,831
<i>Ah, I'm melting...</i>

105
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,839
<i>I'm melting away...</i>

106
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:39,977
<i>This is fun.</i>

107
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:41,938
<i>What is this?</i>

108
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:45,733
<i>It's different.</i>

109
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,235
<i>All of it.</i>

110
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:49,737
<i>Everything feels different.</i>

111
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:51,656
<i>But why?</i>

112
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,535
<i>So that's it...</i>

113
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:05,294
<i>I've been asleep this whole time.</i>

114
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:12,593
<i>I've been playing out our exchange
in my dreams.</i>

115
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:17,098
<i>All this time, I thought there
wasn't a word for this exchange.</i>

116
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:23,604
<i>But thanks to you, I've finally
learned what it's called.</i>

117
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:25,731
<i>Thank you.</i>

118
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:26,983
<i>So this...</i>

119
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,193
<i>This is...!</i>

120
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,572
<i>This is battle!</i>

121
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,825
<i>Hey, did you know?</i>

122
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:39,036
<i>I love fighting.
I love it.</i>

123
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:42,248
<i>There's nothing I can do about it.</i>

124
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,500
<i>Yes, I knew.</i>

125
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,336
<i>Probably long before you ever did.</i>

126
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,131
<i>Say, Kenpachi Zaraki...</i>

127
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,968
<i>You learned the ability
to suppress yourself</i>

128
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:56,512
<i>so you could enjoy the battle
for eternity.</i>

129
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,725
<i>I learned the ability
to heal myself</i>

130
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,269
<i>so I could enjoy the battle
for eternity.</i>

131
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:07,231
<i>But now, I am certain.</i>

132
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:12,862
<i>This power I obtained
was for this single battle.</i>

133
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:16,741
<i>In any era,
there can only be one Kenpachi...</i>

134
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:20,578
<i>That is the rule
as well as an inevitable fate.</i>

135
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:25,333
<i>Because when the strong
find the next strongest,</i>

136
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:29,170
<i>they can no longer swing
their sword for their own sake.</i>

137
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,923
<i>The tip of their sword
will always be pointed</i>

138
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:35,259
<i>either toward
killing the next strongest...</i>

139
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,554
<i>or toward nurturing them.</i>

140
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:40,931
<i>The tip of my sword is...</i>

141
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:51,734
<i>He's the one.</i>

142
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:55,488
<i>This child is the one to be worthy
of the name Kenpachi.</i>

143
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,076
<i>Farewell...</i>

144
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,620
<i>The one man in this world...</i>

145
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,500
<i>who brought me joy.</i>

146
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:14,715
That was magnificent,
Kenpachi Zaraki.

147
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,052
And now, this battle is over...

148
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,433
It's over?

149
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:28,104
Wait, are you going to die?

150
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,898
No, don't die.

151
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:32,900
Not yet.

152
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,735
I still haven't had enough.

153
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,114
Please don't die.

154
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,408
I'm begging you...

155
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,829
Don't die!

156
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:47,915
<i>He's like a child.</i>

157
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,252
<i>What is there to cry about?</i>

158
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:56,132
<i>Sure, now that you've regained
your strength and defeated me...</i>

159
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:59,760
<i>You might see yourself
returning to the days</i>

160
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,847
<i>when you find many of your battles
to be boring.</i>

161
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,599
<i>But right now,</i>

162
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,727
<i>you have foes you can fight
to your heart's content...</i>

163
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,730
<i>and comrades you can
cross swords with on equal terms.</i>

164
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:17,361
<i>Most of all, you have a partner
who has awakened alongside you.</i>

165
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:25,161
<i>Everything I have gained until now,
I've relinquished to you.</i>

166
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:29,123
<i>I no longer possess anything.</i>

167
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:33,961
<i>Even the name of Kenpachi, which
I couldn't give to you back then,</i>

168
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,922
<i>has finally vanished from my hands.</i>

169
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:40,968
<i>Rejoice, Kenpachi Zaraki...</i>

170
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,430
<i>Rejoice for me as I pass away.</i>

171
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:53,606
<i>Ah, what sheer bliss to die from
accomplishing one's purpose...</i>

172
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:10,831
<i>Kenpachi...</i>

173
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,083
<i>Kenpachi of Zaraki...</i>

174
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:14,668
Who's there?

175
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,212
Who's calling my name?!

176
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:17,963
Show yourself!

177
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:22,593
<i>It seems my voice
has finally reached you.</i>

178
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,806
<i>The voice of the one</i>

179
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:31,352
<i>who has been watching you
longer and closer than anyone.</i>

180
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:36,816
Huh?
Who the hell are you?

181
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:39,527
Kenpachi...

182
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,862
Kenpachi of Zaraki!

183
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,866
<i>It's nice to meet you,
Kenpachi Zaraki.</i>

184
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,661
<i>My name is...</i>

185
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:07,263
HOOHDEN - LANDING AREA

186
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,432
There's nobody here.

187
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,230
What is that noise?!

188
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,774
<i>Lower your heads, lower your heads!</i>

189
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:19,942
<i>Because...</i>

190
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,736
<i>Your heads are so high!</i>

191
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:27,658

00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,624
<i>Sikuyoro, whazzup!</i>

196
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,003
<i>Zanpakuto...!</i>

197
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,087
<i>Love it!</i>

198
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:44,133
"GALAXY HOOHDEN"
- Welcome!
- Welcome!

199
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,097
What the hell is all this?

200
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,683
Paradise!
Paradise!

201
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,018
Don't be fooled...

202
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,936
They're probably

203
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:58,439
- illusions or something.
- This is truly paradise!

204
00:14:58,439 --> 00:14:59,565
Shut up...!

205
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,693
So, Kurosaki!
Abarai!

206
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,737
And that strange
stuffed animal, too!

207
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:08,699
Did you guys enjoy
my welcoming show?!

208
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:14,538
Once again, I am Oh-Etsu Nimaiya,
the master of this Hoohden!

209
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,582
"BLADE GOD" - OH-ETSU NIMAIYA

210
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,375
<i>Sikuyoro</i>, whazzup!

211
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,253
Uh, uh!
Pow, pow, pow!

212
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,338
Hey!

213
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,214
Trade places with me...

214
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:27,301
I can't keep up
with this guy's vibe.

215
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:30,346
You idiot!
I can't keep up with it, either!

216
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:31,680
Hmm...

217
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,432
Something's not right...

218
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,393
You guys aren't any fun!

219
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:37,978
Want to leave?

220
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:39,063
- Huh?!
- Huh?!

221
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,817
- No, we'd like to stay, sir!
- Please let us stay, sir!

222
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,570
No!
No, no, no!

223
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,615
That's not the right way to ask!

224
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,409
The formal way you do it
in Hoohden is... like this!

225
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:54,787
Please, sir!

226
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,246
I'm not doing that pose!

227
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,082
Calm down, Ichigo!

228
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,375
We've got to do it!

229
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:01,585
Damn it...

230
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:04,755
- Please, sir!
- Please, sir!

231
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,090
Nice pose!

232
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,592
- Take a look, my honeys!
- Oh my god, that's hilarious!

233
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,177
- Take a look, my honeys!
- They look like bananas!

234
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:11,720
<i>- Bastard...
- Bastard...</i>

235
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:13,806
How long are you...

236
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,517
going to be doing that?!

237
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,811
What was that for, Mera?!

238
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:22,815
Follow me!

239
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:29,446
"HOOHDEN"
<i>This</i> is the real Hoohden!

240
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:30,280
"HOOHDEN"

241
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:31,824
I don't know what to say...

242
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,283
Come on in!

243
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:36,203
I don't want to go into
such a depressing place!

244
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,955
I wanna go back
to that other place!

245
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,541
I agree with you,
strange stuffed animal!

246
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,377
You feel me, right?!

247
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,049
That hurt...

248
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,926
Hey!
What the hell is this?!

249
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:54,179
Kurosaki, Abarai, have you noticed?

250
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:57,599
You two have not met
a single Soul Reaper besides me

251
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,601
on your way here.

252
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:04,273
All of my honeys
you saw earlier are...

253
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,275
Zanpakuto.

254
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:07,860
Zanpakuto?!

255
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,738
What's this?
That's odd.

256
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:11,989
Very odd indeed.

257
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,699
You guys are Soul Reapers

258
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,910
yet you can't tell the difference
between Soul Reapers and Zanpakuto?

259
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,246
What is wrong with you guys?!

260
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:22,583
Is it because you're both
the sort of unloving souls

261
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,711
who would allow <i>this</i>
to happen to your Zanpakuto?

262
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,671
Hey!
When did you—?!

263
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:31,633
Oh my...

264
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:36,889
A Zanpakuto that doesn't
receive love is so easily broken.

265
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:42,478
You two are completely surrounded...
by the anger of Zanpakuto.

266
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,565
If you can make it
out of there alive,

267
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:49,359
I'll consider fixing
your Zanpakuto.

268
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:50,652
What?!

269
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,029
I'll say it one more time!

270
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:55,824
I am the number one
Zanpakuto creator!

271
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,411
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five...

272
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,996
four... three...

273
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:03,165
Two, that's me, Oh-Etsu Nimaiya!

274
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,626
I don't make swords for losers.

275
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:06,668
You bastard...

276
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,505
<i>Sikuyoro</i>, whazzup.

277
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,508
There's something here...

278
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,592
Yeah...

279
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,844
There's nothing to be afraid of.

280
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:19,765
They are the ultimate Zanpakuto
that can become anything...

281
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,809
They're Asauchi.

282
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,478
Asauchi...?

283
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:25,854
ASAUCHI

284
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,398
It's the nameless Zanpakuto...

285
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,193
temporarily issued to
the over 6,000 members

286
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:34,530
of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads
during their time in the Academy

287
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,491
and then officially issued
when they become a squad member.

288
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:41,578
Every Soul Reaper eats and sleeps
with their Asauchi.

289
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:43,330
Through continuous training,

290
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,959
they imprint the essence
of their soul upon their Asauchi

291
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,920
to create their personalized
Zanpakuto!

292
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:54,216
And the one who creates
all of those Asauchi by himself...

293
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:58,262
is me, the Blade God,
Oh-Etsu Nimaiya!

294
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:02,432
Why do we have to be attacked
by these Asauchi?!

295
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:05,644
There's no need to think about why!

296
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:09,940
The important thing to know
is that they're angry with you.

297
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,024
For what?!

298
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:13,819
For the way you use your Zanpakuto.

299
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,195
The way we use them?!

300
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,447
You don't understand?
Of course, you don't.

301
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:19,366
Is it how you fight,
or how you swing?

302
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,577
That's not it, so what is it?

303
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,538
This is how they think of you.

304
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,248
"We're fundamentally different!"

305
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,208
Let's start by discussing

306
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:31,253
whether Zanpakuto or Soul Reapers
are superior!

307
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:52,232
<i>Everything we had left behind</i>

308
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:56,528
<i>Our breaths blending as mist</i>

309
00:19:56,528 --> 00:20:01,033
<i>without form or expression</i>

310
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:05,287
<i>We lie buried as we glare
into the distance</i>

311
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,248
<i>I can't hear anything</i>

312
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:11,501
<i>I can't seem to cut anything</i>

313
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,004
<i>It feels like I'm sinking</i>

314
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,964
<i>Falling, falling</i>

315
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:17,049
<i>Touching</i>

316
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:20,552
<i>Eyes struck wide open</i>

317
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:23,972
<i>Something no one has ever seen</i>

318
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:30,270
<i>The furthest reaches are now visible to us</i>

319
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:34,274
<i>It cannot be undone
and cannot be stopped</i>

320
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:37,611
<i>This ensuing struggle</i>

321
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:42,532
<i>Whisk it away beyond
the ends of the earth</i>

322
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,701
<i>Along with our breaths</i>

323
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,161
<i>Take everything</i>

324
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:50,916
<i>Whisk it away beyond
the ends of the earth</i>

325
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,960
<i>Along with our futures</i>

326
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,836
<i>Along with our world</i>

327
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:59,174
<i>Something no one has ever seen</i>

328
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:05,555
<i>The furthest reaches are now
visible to us</i>

329
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:07,641
<i>Don't you know God's demand?</i>

330
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,559
<i>Don't you know God's demand?</i>

331
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:13,063
<i>As we tear each other down</i>

332
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,736
71 hours and 48 minutes...

333
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,531
You lasted for three days.

334
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,657
I'm impressed.

335
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:27,119
You pass, Renji!

336
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:34,751
And... you fail, Ichigo!

337
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,171
W-Wait... I can still...

338
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:40,590
Nope! No waiting.
You're done.

339
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,676
You fail.
The end.

340
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,679
I...can still keep going!

341
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,306
Let me do this...!

342
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:49,725
There's no time limit, is there?!

343
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,811
There isn't a time limit,
but rather an emotional limit.

344
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,732
I'm not talking about whether
you can keep going or not.

345
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,527
You just weren't chosen
by an Asauchi.

346
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:02,321
It's not going to happen.

347
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,197
It's over.
The end.

348
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:06,283
- Wait!
- Give it a rest.

349
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:10,454
You were dumped.
So stop whining.

350
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,415
What's become perfectly clear
in these last three days

351
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:17,669
is that Renji's a Soul Reaper
while you, Ichigo, are not.

352
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:21,798
Don't worry,
I'll open up a way out of there.

353
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:23,258
And so,

354
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:25,802
time for you to go home.

355
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:30,766
What?

356
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:34,186
- Mera! Pull him out of there.
- Sure.

357
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,063
H-Hold on a second!

358
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:37,397
You're joking, right?!

359
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:39,608
Oh, one more thing.

360
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:42,569
Don't enter the Soul Society
ever again.

361
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:45,530
The Soul Society
is the land of Soul Reapers.

362
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,033
An ordinary human
without a Zanpakuto

363
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,910
has no right to enter it.

364
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:51,620
Damn it...!

365
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:55,874
You really think I'm just going
to leave after coming this far?

366
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:59,711
If I leave now,
what'll happen to Zangetsu?

367
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,672
Whether you leave or not,
it makes no difference.

368
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,841
Zangetsu cannot be fixed anymore.

369
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:05,926
Or rather,

370
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,636
I <i>won't</i> fix him.

371
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,180
As I said before...

372
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,641
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five...

373
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:13,725
four... three...

374
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,769
Two, that's me, Oh-Etsu Nimaiya!

375
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:19,231
I don't make swords
for a fake Soul Reaper.

376
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,233
You bastard!

377
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:28,698
Bye-buh-bye, Ichigo!

378
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:35,789
You're no good
as you are now, Ichigo.

379
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:39,292
The fact that an Asauchi
didn't choose you...

380
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:42,921
The fact that you've fought
this long <i>without</i> an Asauchi...

381
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:46,091
You don't understand
the significance of this.

382
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,803
You need to go back...

383
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,138
Back to your roots.

384
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:55,267
And you must learn
what your roots are.

385
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:00,689
Even if you are unable to return
upon learning them.

386
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:04,484
"KUROSAKI CLINIC"
Even if you are unable to return
upon learning them.

387
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:14,453
<i>"You, without sin,
are like the sun."</i>
