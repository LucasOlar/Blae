{\an8}THE QUINCY EXTERMINATION OPERATION
FROM 1,000 YEARS AGO

2
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,029
It wasn't 200 years ago?

3
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:31,906
What's this...?

4
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:07,776
{\an8}<i>The blue skies above are hopelessly clear</i>

5
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:13,073
{\an8}<i>At my wit's end, I feel a growing frustration</i>

6
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:17,911
{\an8}<i>As if to laugh at us hopeless cowards</i>

7
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:21,664
{\an8}<i>Countless eyes stare at us</i>

8
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:27,962
{\an8}<i>This soul of mine breaks again and again</i>

9
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:31,216
{\an8}<i>All I can do is hold it tight</i>

10
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:37,430
{\an8}<i>Until the day it turns to ash</i>

11
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:40,308
{\an8}<i>I've absorbed all of this sorrow</i>

12
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:44,938
{\an8}<i>It has shaped me, painted me</i>

13
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,774
{\an8}<i>But that's how we got here, right?</i>

14
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:52,737
{\an8}<i>One step at a time, just like breathing</i>

15
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:55,281
{\an8}<i>These countless scars on my palm</i>

16
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:57,283
{\an8}<i>That no longer fade</i>

17
00:01:57,408 --> 00:02:01,037
{\an8}<i>Are my badge, my story</i>

18
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:04,999
{\an8}<i>I faced the fear and shred it to pieces</i>

19
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:08,086
{\an8}<i>And let it walk beside me once more</i>

20
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:12,841
{\an8}BLEACH: THOUSAND-YEAR BLOOD WAR

21
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:45,456
It's been a thousand years,
hasn't it, Yhwach?

22
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,503
I've come to put an end
to your life.

23
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,968
Good indeed.

24
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:00,930
It's always nice to see
one's spirits lifted.

25
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:02,932
That is for certain.

26
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:07,270
But you people...
have misjudged one thing.

27
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:11,524
Your boss will lose to our boss.

28
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,778
Because it's not just you people
whose spirits are lifted...

29
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,364
from knowing that
our bosses are fighting!

30
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:20,992
Die, old man!

31
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:27,707
You're right.

32
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,375
Someone misjudged.

33
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:35,798
Your conventions
don't apply to Old Man Yama...

34
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,934
Fools...!

35
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:51,356
That's what they get
for interfering in my battle.

36
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:57,028
What? You look like
you want to say something—

37
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:02,700
Your Majesty!

38
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,789
You haven't changed, Yhwach.

39
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:12,502
But know that your habit of
selling your subordinates short...

40
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,380
will end here.

41
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:20,885
You've grown old,
Shigekuni Yamamoto.

42
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:22,637
However...

43
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:25,682
seeing you let your rage
take over like that...

44
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,934
reminds me of when
you were younger.

45
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:29,143
Nonsense!

46
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,932
You've finally drawn it...

47
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:12,270
You talk as if you've been
waiting for me to draw my sword.

48
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,106
Do you know why I was waiting?

49
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,986
Your flesh, blood, sword, and soul...

50
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:23,823
I intend to crush you
until there's nothing left!

51
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,214
<i>My throat feels dry...</i>

52
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:48,306
My lips cracked open...

53
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:50,183
Captain Unohana...

54
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:53,353
Does your skin feel kind of dry
all of a sudden?

55
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:55,271
Oh my, Isane.

56
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:58,483
How cute of you
to worry about your skin.

57
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,152
N-No, that's not what I meant...!

58
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,447
<i>Please settle this quickly...</i>

59
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:09,702
<i>before your power itself
destroys the Soul Society.</i>

60
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:16,667
You can't use Hyorinmaru anymore.

61
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,503
You've noticed, haven't you?

62
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,130
Every drop of water
in the Soul Society

63
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,883
is quietly evaporating
little by little.

64
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:25,760
There's no mistake...

65
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:27,637
This is...

66
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:33,393
Bankai...
Zanka no Tachi!

67
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:36,938
Bankai?

68
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,733
That scorched little sword
is his Bankai?

69
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,235
Don't underestimate it.

70
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:46,739
Zanka no Tachi is a Bankai
that seals all of his flames

71
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:48,658
within that single blade.

72
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:50,701
One swing and it's all over.

73
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:54,038
Everything it cuts is burnt by an explosive flame.

74
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:55,790
It is a sword of hellfire.

75
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,375
That's right...

76
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:02,547
You've seen this Bankai
a thousand years ago, haven't you?

77
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,758
But are you sure about that?

78
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:10,721
Feel for yourself
whether it's still the same

79
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:13,182
as a thousand years ago.

80
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:19,897
<i>He cut me...!</i>

81
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,358
<i>But where are the flames?</i>

82
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,277
<i>Is his Bankai really different</i>

83
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,904
<i>from the way it was
a thousand years ago?</i>

84
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:30,074
<i>Flames are his Bankai's power.</i>

85
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,868
<i>There's no mistake about that.</i>

86
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,912
<i>Then, where did all that flame
disappear to?!</i>

87
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,297
The tip of his sword!

88
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,007
Correct!

89
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:58,728
Zanka no Tachi, East!
Kyokujitsujin!

90
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:02,565
I've focused
all the heat of my flames

91
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,859
into just the tip of my blade.

92
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,404
It does not burn,
nor does it emit an explosive flame.

93
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:13,826
It merely blows away everything
it touches without a trace.

94
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,291
All it means is that
I just have to cut you down

95
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,668
without letting
your sword touch me!

96
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:31,093
What?

97
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:36,807
A thousand years ago,
all of you died.

98
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:46,150
Today,
I will force you to remember...

99
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:51,697
that all of you are nothing
but a horde of corpses

100
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,158
just waiting to be burned!

101
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:01,999
These flames...

102
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:06,212
I just told you about
my Zanka no Tachi, East...

103
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,215
If there is an East,
there is also a West.

104
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:16,222
Zanka no Tachi, West.
Zanjitsu Gokui!

105
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:24,397
Its heat...
is 15 million degrees Celsius.

106
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,651
You can no longer touch me now.

107
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:32,238
When I use my Bankai,
think of my body and blade

108
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,366
as being enveloped by the sun.

109
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:37,702
<i>Flames.</i>

110
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,912
<i>15 million degrees Celsius...</i>

111
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:44,542
<i>There's no way such immense heat
would be visible as flames.</i>

112
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,794
<i>Is this an illusion?</i>

113
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:48,629
<i>Wait...</i>

114
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:53,467
<i>Perhaps his Spiritual Pressure
is so overwhelmingly powerful</i>

115
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:56,929
<i>that it looks like flames
as it bursts out of him...</i>

116
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,640
<i>Shigekuni Yamamoto!</i>

117
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,061
Now then...

118
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:07,189
I'm ending this, Yhwach.

119
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:11,569
If I don't end this soon, you...

120
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:16,407
and I, as well as the Soul Society,
will burn to ashes.

121
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:21,579
"A thousand years ago,"

122
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,956
"the Quincy empire
known as the Licht Reich"

123
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,791
"intended to annihilate
all Hollows."

124
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,628
"They invaded the Soul Society,
who had opposed them,"

125
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,339
"but were wiped out by
the Thirteen Court Guard Squads..."

126
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:33,758
"Then 200 years ago..."

127
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,010
"The Soul Reapers
unilaterally decided to"

128
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,429
"exterminate
the surviving Quincies,"

129
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:41,724
"believing that they would disrupt
the circulation of souls."

130
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,686
I guess this means that
no matter how much we try,

131
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:48,397
Quincies and Soul Reapers
will never get along...

132
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:54,987
<i>The Soul Society isn't involved,
but I'm still a Soul Reaper!</i>

133
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,948
<i>No.
You're a Substitute Soul Reaper.</i>

134
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:01,952
<i>Furthermore, the Soul Society
has abandoned you.</i>

135
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,665
<i>I'm a Quincy.</i>

136
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:08,668
<i>I cannot help Hollows or Arrancars.</i>

137
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:10,127
<i>I know.</i>

138
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,798
<i>Quincies exist
to destroy Hollows, right?</i>

139
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:15,800
<i>Kurosaki...</i>

140
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,767
<i>It feels like I'm burning...</i>

141
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,688
<i>My eyes, my hair, my throat...</i>

142
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,439
<i>If it weren't for Blut,</i>

143
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:32,817
<i>I probably would have turned
into ashes even at this distance.</i>

144
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,318
What's the matter?

145
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,487
Are you just going to watch?

146
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:40,866
Wait, that question
was a bit spiteful.

147
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,994
Your sword is broken
and there's nothing you can do.

148
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,831
I don't blame you
for not being able to move.

149
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:49,083
You can run if you'd like.

150
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,670
Except I'll quickly catch up
and kill you!

151
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,263
Of course...

152
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,515
Your sword is broken.

153
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:13,691
All you have left are your arrows.

154
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,236
Now then...

155
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,531
Shall we?

156
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,577
Kirchenlied...

157
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,541
Sankt Zwinger!

158
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,253
This is a Quincy's
ultimate defensive incantation

159
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:35,755
that combines offense and defense!

160
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:40,426
Step into this and you will be
torn apart by God's light!

161
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,094
I told you, you cannot harm me!

162
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,099
The dead...

163
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:51,562
The ashes of those who perished
by my flame.

164
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,355
Give me a hand...

165
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:58,402
And I will give you
a moment's joy of battle.

166
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,699
Zanka no Tachi, South...

167
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:14,126
Kakajumanokushidaisojin!

168
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:24,553
What is this?

169
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,807
What in the world is this?!

170
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:35,064
Kakajumanokushidaisojin...

171
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:41,737
I awaken those I have slain by
heating their ashes with my blade.

172
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,824
These awakened dead become my limbs

173
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:49,954
and chase down those I deem to be
enemies until they turn into dust!

174
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,707
How laughable that
the head of the Soul Reapers

175
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:54,959
would awaken the dead!

176
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:59,171
You don't deserve to be called
a Soul Reaper, Shigekuni Yamamoto!

177
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:00,798
Don't think you can stop me...

178
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,176
with something like this!

179
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:13,936
Your mouth works well,
but your eyes don't work at all.

180
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,367
Seydlitz...!

181
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:34,164
Argola!
Hubert!

182
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:38,043
Do you see the subordinates
that you mercilessly killed?

183
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,838
Shigekuni Yamamoto, you bastard!

184
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:45,885
Are you regretting not stealing
my Bankai earlier?

185
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,011
No, that's not it.

186
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:50,764
It's not that you decided
not to steal my Bankai.

187
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:53,726
You <i>couldn't</i>.

188
00:14:54,018 --> 00:15:00,065
You people steal Bankai by learning
its power and understanding it.

189
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:01,358
Am I wrong?

190
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:05,738
I haven't shown my true power
even a thousand years ago.

191
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,282
You cannot steal what is
beyond your understanding.

192
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,867
It's as simple as that.

193
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,452
Wait!
Where are you going?!

194
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:13,037
Don't make a fuss.

195
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,915
If you want to kill me,
then come after me.

196
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,918
After you defeat your subordinates
who stand before you, that is.

197
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,586
You bastard...

198
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:35,476
It seems that even you still had
a shred of humanity left.

199
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,524
Don't talk as if you know me!

200
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:43,943
I thought I told you...

201
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:49,281
don't assume you can stop me
with the likes of this!

202
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:59,708
I can see your tears, Yhwach.

203
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,295
Painful, isn't it?

204
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:06,799
To have to destroy the corpses
of your subordinates...

205
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,968
just to reach me.

206
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,136
You must hate me, don't you?

207
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,597
For using such a dirty tactic as

208
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:16,934
bringing your dead subordinates
back to the battlefield.

209
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,063
But none of what
you're experiencing...

210
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,941
could compare to
the hatred and suffering...

211
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:27,778
of the Soul Reapers
that you have killed!

212
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:33,492
Zanka no Tachi, North...

213
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,787
Tenchi Kaijin!

214
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:43,395
I-I wasn't... strong enough...

215
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,441
Please forgive me...

216
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:52,404
<i>Wait, who would the boss
be apologizing to?</i>

217
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:57,910
<i>This war was started by you.
And you've lost.</i>

218
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,661
<i>Who are you apologizing to?</i>

219
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:05,125
I wasn't able to...
carry out your orders...

220
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,544
Who in the world are you?!

221
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:09,463
Your Majesty Yhwach...!

222
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,219
The Squad 1 Barracks...!

223
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,305
Okikiba!

224
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,814
Damn you, Yhwach...

225
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:29,316
Stern Ritter "Y"...

226
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:31,485
"The Yourself."

227
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,403
The "R" of Royd Loyd.

228
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:37,533
You made sure that no one noticed
I wasn't present.

229
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,326
Well done.

230
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:42,746
You...

231
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,749
said... I did well...

232
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,794
W-What an... honor to—

233
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,092
You bastard...

234
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:58,679
What have you been up to until now?

235
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,850
What's beneath
the Squad 1 Barracks?

236
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,062
The Central Underground
Great Prison!

237
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:11,275
I went and met with Sosuke Aizen.

238
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,072
{\an8}THE CENTRAL UNDERGROUND
GREAT PRISON

239
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:25,622
Yhwach, huh?

240
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,293
I have many ways of
finding out your name.

241
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:32,671
Though I didn't think I would
get to see you with my own eyes...

242
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,174
I won't ask why you're here.

243
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:38,552
The unpleasant Spiritual Pressure
swirling on the surface above

244
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,262
is enough to tell me
what is happening.

245
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,723
In that case,
this simplifies things.

246
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:46,977
One of the Special Threats,
Sosuke Aizen...

247
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,646
come under my command.

248
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:55,235
The Quincy King is welcoming me
into the Wandenreich?

249
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:58,614
We share the same path—

250
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:02,618
the goal of destroying
the Soul Society, don't we?

251
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:04,953
The same path, huh?

252
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,040
I refuse.

253
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:09,666
What?

254
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,502
I cannot stand to see
the Quincy King

255
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:14,713
following in the footsteps
of a Soul Reaper.

256
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,592
Is that your answer?

257
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:23,055
We're done talking here.

258
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,266
Are you leaving already?

259
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:31,855
You came here because you saw
my power as a threat, didn't you?

260
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:33,774
That's right.

261
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:37,152
But since you are fused
with the Hogyoku,

262
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:39,029
it would take too long to kill you

263
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,990
or take you with us
to restrain you.

264
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:44,159
A wise decision.

265
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:48,747
It is best to minimize the time
we spend sharing the same path.

266
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:50,916
Especially when
dealing with someone

267
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,584
who should eventually
be eliminated.

268
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,095
Now then...

269
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:07,641
I see you've exhausted your powers
in your battle with my impostor.

270
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,977
Haven't you, Shigekuni Yamamoto?

271
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,813
Shut up!
Bankai!

272
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:23,031
It's not that we couldn't steal
your Bankai.

273
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:28,662
But your power is so strong that
no one other than I can handle it.

274
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:34,626
Therefore, I ordered Royd
to leave it alone until I returned.

275
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,295
So what now?

276
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,797
I can use the power of this Bankai

277
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:43,343
to awaken the corpses
of your subordinates,

278
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:46,013
Genryusai Yamamoto.

279
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:47,806
You bastard!

280
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:17,711
Farewell, Shigekuni Yamamoto.

281
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:45,238
{\an8}<i>Everything we had left behind</i>

282
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:49,576
{\an8}<i>Our breaths blending as mist</i>

283
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:53,997
{\an8}<i>without form or expression</i>

284
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:58,293
{\an8}<i>We lie buried as we glare
into the distance</i>

285
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:01,254
{\an8}<i>I can't hear anything</i>

286
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,508
{\an8}<i>I can't seem to cut anything</i>

287
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,010
{\an8}<i>It feels like I'm sinking</i>

288
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,970
{\an8}<i>Falling, falling</i>

289
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,055
{\an8}<i>Touching</i>

290
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:13,642
{\an8}<i>Eyes struck wide open</i>

291
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:16,895
{\an8}<i>Something no one has ever seen</i>

292
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:23,276
{\an8}<i>The furthest reaches are now visible to us</i>

293
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:27,280
{\an8}<i>It cannot be undone
and cannot be stopped</i>

294
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,534
{\an8}<i>This ensuing struggle</i>

295
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:35,497
{\an8}<i>Whisk it away beyond
the ends of the earth</i>

296
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,666
{\an8}<i>Along with our breaths</i>

297
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:39,167
{\an8}<i>Take everything</i>

298
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:43,922
{\an8}<i>Whisk it away beyond
the ends of the earth</i>

299
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:45,966
{\an8}<i>Along with our futures</i>

300
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,843
{\an8}<i>Along with our world</i>

301
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:52,139
{\an8}<i>Something no one has ever seen</i>

302
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:58,645
{\an8}<i>The furthest reaches are now
visible to us</i>

303
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:00,647
{\an8}<i>Don't you know God's demand?</i>

304
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,524
{\an8}<i>Don't you know God's demand?</i>

305
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:06,027
{\an8}<i>As we tear each other down</i>

306
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:15,871
<i>"A petal falling,
never to bloom again."</i>

307
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,542
<i>"A petal in flames,
full of beauty."</i>
