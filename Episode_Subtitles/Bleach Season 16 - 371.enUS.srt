1
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,850
To all captains, lieutenants,

2
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:19,352
and squad members of all ranks
within the Seireitei!

3
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:22,104
<i>Substitute Soul Reaper
Ichigo Kurosaki</i>

4
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:23,773
<i>is heading to the Soul Society!</i>

5
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:28,278
His Bankai cannot be stolen
by the Quincies!

6
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:29,779
What?!

7
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:31,906
Ichigo is...

8
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:33,867
He's on his way, huh?!

9
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:35,118
Ichigo...

10
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:36,786
Ichigo...!

11
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:38,580
Akon, huh?

12
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,708
How dare he act on his own.

13
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:46,295
Once Ichigo Kurosaki joins us,

14
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,796
the tide of battle
will turn in our...

15
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:50,216
– Wait.
– What is it, Third Seat Akon?

16
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:52,343
Something's wrong.

17
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,680
Ichigo Kurosaki's
Spiritual Pressure in the Garganta...

18
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:57,682
It disappeared.

19
00:00:57,807 --> 00:01:00,894
{\an8}"DISCONNECTED"

20
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,353
Look into it right away.

21
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,438
And also send
the Secret Remote Unit

22
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,607
to the Senkaimon exit!

23
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:06,858
Yes, sir!

24
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,447
Jidanbo?!

25
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,574
What the hell are you doing?!

26
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,294
Damn it...
What the hell is this?!

27
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,676
{\an8}"AKON"

28
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:36,763
Sorry! I don't know how,
but I got trapped...

29
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,437
What's going on?!
What's happening, Akon?!

30
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,188
– Akon!
– <i>Evacuate!</i>

31
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,857
– <i>Hiyosu!</i>
– <i>You too, Akon! Get going!</i>

32
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:52,737
{\an8}"AKON"

33
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:55,030
– <i>Damn it. All I can hear are</i>
– Rukia!

34
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:56,449
– <i>screams and explosions!</i>
– Renji!

35
00:01:56,908 --> 00:02:00,410
<i>Help... Somebody help us!
Help!</i>

36
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,704
– <i>I'm going to kill you, bastards!</i>
– <i>No! I can't take this anymore!</i>

37
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:04,874
<i>You call yourselves members of
the 13 Court Guard Squads?!</i>

38
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:09,003
<i>It hurts... It hurts!</i>

39
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:12,549
Don't give up...!

40
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:13,925
We must stand our ground!

41
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:18,471
Ichigo will come... I know he will!

42
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,753
{\an8}<i>The blue skies above are hopelessly clear</i>

43
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,967
{\an8}<i>At my wit's end, I feel
a growing frustration</i>

44
00:02:56,426 --> 00:03:00,805
{\an8}<i>As if to laugh at us hopeless cowards</i>

45
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,559
{\an8}<i>Countless eyes stare at us</i>

46
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:10,982
{\an8}<i>This soul of mine breaks again and again</i>

47
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:14,194
{\an8}<i>All I can do is hold it tight</i>

48
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:20,408
{\an8}<i>Until the day it turns to ash</i>

49
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,286
{\an8}<i>I've absorbed all of this sorrow</i>

50
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:27,956
{\an8}<i>It has shaped me, painted me</i>

51
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:30,752
{\an8}<i>But that's how we got here, right?</i>

52
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:35,756
{\an8}<i>One step at a time, just like breathing</i>

53
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,301
{\an8}<i>These countless scars on my palm</i>

54
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,302
{\an8}<i>That no longer fade</i>

55
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:44,015
{\an8}<i>Are my badge, my story</i>

56
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:47,977
{\an8}<i>I faced the fear and shred it to pieces</i>

57
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:51,063
{\an8}<i>And let it walk beside me once more</i>

58
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:55,777
{\an8}BLEACH: THOUSAND-YEAR BLOOD WAR

59
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:13,670
It seems he's on a rampage inside.

60
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:15,755
But it's no use...

61
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,217
His Majesty granted me
the letter "J"!

62
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,677
Quilge Opie, "The Jail"!

63
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:25,807
There's no way you can escape
from that prison!

64
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:28,810
Now then...

65
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:33,189
Before the power that I absorbed
from that monster disappears...

66
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,859
I should eliminate
all of you as well...

67
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,196
No!

68
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,414
<i>Who could have done that?!</i>

69
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,417
<i>Shit...!</i>

70
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,049
Damn it...

71
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,676
Even with Getsuga...

72
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:05,888
I can't break this thing
even with Getsugatensho?!

73
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:10,977
– Captain!
– Stay back!

74
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,480
Watch me fight...

75
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:17,191
and figure out his abilities!

76
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,570
I-If that's the plan,
then let me go first!

77
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:23,697
Since my Senbonzakura
has been stolen,

78
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:26,784
your Bankai is our last hope...

79
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:28,411
Captain...

80
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:31,456
I'm going to draw out
his abilities.

81
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:34,167
I want you to stay there
and watch for now...

82
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:41,466
<i>Why does it feel like
my limbs are freezing?</i>

83
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:46,929
<i>Are those thorns of light
covered with some kind of poison?!</i>

84
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:49,932
I see you've noticed...

85
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,894
You're wondering if it's poison,
aren't you?

86
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,438
It's not.

87
00:05:56,272 --> 00:06:02,236
This is something that you lost
a long time ago.

88
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,655
Retrace your memories.

89
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,783
You became a captain...

90
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,409
You became strong...

91
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:11,954
You became able to
overpower your enemies...

92
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:15,666
It's a sensation you haven't felt
in a long time, isn't it?

93
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:22,173
That is the most important
sensation for a person to survive.

94
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,676
It is called "fear."

95
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,973
Fear? The Captain?

96
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,309
For those who have been
struck by my arrows,

97
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,979
all sorts of things turn into fear.

98
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:42,318
"What if I reach for my sword,
or if I draw it?"

99
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,863
"What if I swing it up,
or swing it down?"

100
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:50,368
"What if I move my fingers,
or shift my gaze?"

101
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:53,329
"What if I breathe in,
or breathe out?"

102
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:57,166
"Maybe something fatal will occur."

103
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,086
Anything and everything
is suspicious,

104
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,340
making it impossible
to even think straight.

105
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:11,722
But you are enduring it so far
by sheer force of will.

106
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,474
You are a threat.

107
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:16,811
But that's all it is.
A threat.

108
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,856
It can hardly compare to "fear."

109
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:23,359
The core of your soul is already...

110
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:28,739
consumed by your fear of me.

111
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:30,867
<i>Ridiculous.</i>

112
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:34,036
<i>There is no battle without fear.</i>

113
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:40,376
<i>I have accepted and overcome
my fear of battle.</i>

114
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,670
<i>I gained the strength
to move forward.</i>

115
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,339
<i>I have nothing to fear—</i>

116
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,266
"Fear can be conquered
with experience."

117
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,893
The stronger and
more experienced you are,

118
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,854
the harder you fall
for that illusion.

119
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:03,900
Fear that has a cause is easy.

120
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,235
If there is a cause to it,

121
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,905
then by removing that cause,

122
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:11,908
you also remove
what you think is fear.

123
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:16,996
But true fear has no cause.

124
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:21,667
That's because it's not an emotion.
It is instinct.

125
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:24,295
True fear...

126
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,840
has no cause or limits.

127
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:30,635
It crawls up your body

128
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:34,764
like countless flies.

129
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:39,810
We cannot... escape our instincts.

130
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,154
What?!

131
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:13,469
Brother?

132
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,485
There is nothing you can do.

133
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:34,991
You cannot defeat your own Bankai
with just your Shikai.

134
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:40,580
Senbonzakura... doesn't belong to
a bastard like you!

135
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:44,667
Brother!

136
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:48,212
Are you turning your back toward
the enemy during battle?

137
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,756
I feel insulted.

138
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:00,975
Zabimaru!

139
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,583
Stop it...

140
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,505
Stop it!

141
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,673
Ban...

142
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,309
You fool.

143
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:46,354
He was about to use his Bankai.

144
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,814
You could have stolen it.

145
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:53,319
What?!
I thought only captains had Bankai!

146
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:57,907
You need to go back and reread
His Majesty's Daten.

147
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,671
<i>Renji...</i>

148
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:14,548
<i>Rukia...</i>

149
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:23,849
<i>Forgive me.</i>

150
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,787
{\an8}THE SEIREITEI – NEAR SHORYU GATE

151
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,091
Hey.

152
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,720
Are you the boss of these losers?

153
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,222
Kenpachi Zaraki!

154
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,227
Three Stern Ritters dead?

155
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:11,439
{\an8}STERN RITTER "Q" "THE QUESTION" /
"R" "THE ROAR" / "Y" "THE YOURSELF"

156
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,733
But how...?!

157
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,277
There's not much to explain.

158
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:19,655
The first one, the big guy,
was trash.

159
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:23,367
He attacked me
by turning into a giant monkey

160
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,661
that could blast his enemies
with just his voice.

161
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,331
So I split him in two.

162
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,000
– <i>"The Question"! I object to everything</i>
– The second one

163
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:34,085
– <i>about you, Kenpachi Zaraki!</i>
– got on my nerves talking about

164
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,255
– <i>Anyone that I object to will be—</i>
– objecting to everything about me.

165
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,091
So I tore out his throat.

166
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,802
The third guy wasn't too bad.

167
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,764
He transformed into me, after all.

168
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,602
I struggled a bit
because I was fighting myself.

169
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:56,358
But that just meant I had to become
stronger than his impression of me.

170
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,987
I heard you were a monster...

171
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:01,572
but now I understand.

172
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:04,742
I've got no business with
a scrawny pale guy like you.

173
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,663
I came here...

174
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:13,042
to fight <i>you</i>!

175
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,293
Your Majesty!

176
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:31,059
{\an8}"GENJI-JUKU"

177
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,061
Rukia...

00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:37,691
Damn it...!

179
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:38,984
Damn it!

180
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:44,823
Break!

181
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,367
Break, damn it!

182
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,704
I won't let you die...

183
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:53,666
I won't let <i>any</i> of you die...!

184
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:56,585
I'm going to...

185
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:00,464
I <i>will</i> protect you all!

186
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:06,678
{\an8}GARGANTA – SEIREITEI SIDE APERTURE

187
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,429
– Y-Yes, sir!
– Y-Yes, sir!

188
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,767
{\an8}FRONT OF SQUAD 9 BARRACKS

189
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,563
It sucks!

190
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:20,317
It sucks, it sucks,
it sucks, it sucks!

191
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:24,280
It sucks to be so weak,
doesn't it, Lieutenant?!

192
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,490
{\an8}STERN RITTER "O" "THE OVERKILL"

193
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,618
<i>Damn it!
I'm no match for him...</i>

194
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,621
Are you scared of my strength?

195
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:36,375
His Majesty granted me
the letter "O"!

196
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,794
"The Overkill."

197
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:41,589
Whether it be
friend or foe or beast,

198
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,550
the more I kill,
the stronger I get!

199
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:47,719
I've already killed
a hundred people

200
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,721
since I got here today.

201
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,641
The last time I came,
it was also a hundred.

202
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:56,312
I remember killing a lieutenant
just like you!

203
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,526
So it was you...!

204
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:05,613
I did it...

205
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:06,822
like this!

206
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:13,829
H...

207
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,332
Head Captain!

208
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:24,381
This is my lucky day!

209
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:25,591
Head Captain!

210
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:28,093
I came here for you!

211
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,596
I'm going to use
your subordinate's Bankai...

212
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:34,266
...to end your life!

213
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,352
Bankai...

214
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,147
{\an8}BANKAI

215
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:45,069
{\an8}KOKO GONRYO RIKYU

216
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,702
Doesn't this bring back memories?!

217
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:58,290
I heard this guy hadn't used
this Bankai in over 2,000 years!

218
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,210
You get to see it once more!

219
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:03,712
You should be thanking me!

220
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:07,257
<i>So this is
Lieutenant Sasakibe's Bankai?!</i>

221
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,760
<i>I had no idea there was
a Zanpakuto aside from Hyorinmaru...</i>

222
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,346
<i>that could control the weather!</i>

223
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:21,855
Master Eijisai...

224
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,732
Master Eijisai Yamamoto!

225
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:32,950
{\an8}FOUNDER OF GENRYU STYLE / GENJI-JUKU
GRAND MASTER SHIGEKUNI YAMAMOTO

226
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,703
Hey!
Don't call me Eijisai!

227
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,579
F-Forgive me, sir!

228
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,624
<i>For some reason, each time
I distinguished myself in battle,</i>

229
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,628
<i>the name Eijisai
became more widely used.</i>

230
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:47,506
<i>I didn't care much for that.</i>

231
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,801
But, Master Eijisai,
I cannot be so audacious

232
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:54,054
as to call you by your real name!

233
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,640
What is with you, anyway?!

234
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,725
You're not even one of my students,

235
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,644
and yet,
you hang around here every day!

236
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,314
I come here hoping to be
your right-hand man!

237
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:07,234
In that case, all the more reason
for you to become my student!

238
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,611
If you rise to the rank of master,

239
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,488
you'll naturally become
my right-hand man!

240
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,614
No, Master Eijisai,
if I become your student,

241
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,784
then I will only be mimicking you.

242
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,495
A right-hand man must be one
who can compensate

243
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,414
for the things you are
unable to handle!

244
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,666
You're always splitting hairs...

245
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,461
Also, I haven't shown up every day.

246
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,671
This is my first time here
in a month.

247
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,716
As you told me to a month ago,

248
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,761
I have acquired a Bankai.

249
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:35,095
Oh?

250
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:40,309
In that case, try to defeat me
with that Bankai of yours.

251
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,979
{\an8}RUKON DISTRICT –
EAST 37 DISTRICT, RYUGON

252
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:48,859
Bankai!

253
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:50,944
Koko Gonryo Rikyu!

254
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,714
<i>It was a magnificent Bankai.</i>

255
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:14,051
<i>He wasn't able to defeat me, but...</i>

256
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:19,681
<i>His Bankai left a permanent scar
on my forehead.</i>

257
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,935
That Bankai is like a newborn.

258
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,437
That's right.

259
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:29,566
I intend to spend the rest of
my life honing this Bankai

260
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:32,569
so it can be helpful to you,
Master Eijisai!

261
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:36,323
<i>His words contained no lies.</i>

262
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,910
<i>After years of grueling training,</i>

263
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:45,582
<i>everybody in the Soul Society
came to know Chojiro's name.</i>

264
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:50,670
<i>When my scar dried, it looked like
the Japanese character "Ju,"</i>

265
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:54,174
<i>so everyone started
calling me Jujisai.</i>

266
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:58,261
I cannot allow the scar I gave you

267
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,848
to be a reason to change your name,
Master Eijisai.

268
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,559
<i>Everyone except Chojiro...</i>

269
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:06,687
<i>He stubbornly continued to
call me Eijisai.</i>

270
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,571
{\an8}"RYU (WILLOW)"

271
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,865
<i>So for Chojiro's sake,</i>

272
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:21,492
<i>I took on the name Genryusai.</i>

273
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,203
{\an8}"GENRYUSAI"

274
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,082
Head Captain!

275
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,668
Hey!
What's the matter, old man?!

276
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,669
Have you lost the strength
to even retaliate

277
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,964
after getting hit by
your subordinate's Bankai?!

278
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,842
Come on, say something!

279
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,017
Chojiro...

280
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,561
I can feel your frustration...

281
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:52,941
I understand your anger... very well...

282
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:58,572
Because I know...
the Bankai that you had honed...

283
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:02,242
is absolutely not this weak!

284
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:07,789
<i>Burn...</i>

285
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:13,795
<i>I'm finally able to give you
a proper send-off.</i>

286
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,549
<i>Chojiro...</i>

287
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,510
<i>Farewell.</i>

288
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,601
Do not worry.

289
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:30,729
Every last member
of the rebel army...

290
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:34,650
I will slaughter them
with my own hand.

291
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,617
The Head Captain...

292
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,954
The Head Captain is furious!

293
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:52,208
I've... never felt the Head Captain
get this angry before...

294
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:54,795
You idiot.
Neither have I.

295
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:59,216
That includes him
fighting on the front lines.

296
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,970
Look at how hard
the Head Captain is fighting.

297
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:07,641
We captains and lieutenants
can't let ourselves be defeated.

298
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:08,976
You're right, sir.

299
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:18,694
Get up!

300
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:21,487
We cannot let ourselves
lie on the ground

301
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:23,323
while Master Genryusai
still stands!

302
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,199
As a Court Guard Squad member,

303
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,411
that would be
an unacceptable disgrace!

304
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:30,664
– Sir!
– Yes, sir!

305
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,625
Whoa, wait a minute...

306
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:36,711
You guys were as good as dead
a second ago...

307
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,505
What's going on here?

308
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,425
This is a real problem, isn't it?

309
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,302
Old Man Yama's Spiritual Pressure

310
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,471
is reverberating throughout
the Seireitei.

311
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,266
It's giving me goosebumps.

312
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,685
Like he's scolding me...

313
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:55,563
As if he's saying, "I don't remember
raising you to be a coward..."

314
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:58,567
"Who'd struggle against
an enemy of this level!"

315
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:10,245
{\an8}<i>Everything we had left behind</i>

316
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:14,623
{\an8}<i>Our breaths blending as mist</i>

317
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:19,046
{\an8}<i>without form or expression</i>

318
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:23,383
{\an8}<i>We lie buried as we glare
into the distance</i>

319
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,386
{\an8}<i>I can't hear anything</i>

320
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:29,638
{\an8}<i>I can't seem to cut anything</i>

321
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:32,100
{\an8}<i>It feels like I'm sinking</i>

322
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:34,101
{\an8}<i>Falling, falling</i>

323
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:35,186
{\an8}<i>Touching</i>

324
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:38,607
{\an8}<i>Eyes struck wide open</i>

325
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:42,026
{\an8}<i>Something no one has ever seen</i>

326
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:48,283
{\an8}<i>The furthest reaches are now visible to us</i>

327
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:52,287
{\an8}<i>It cannot be undone
and cannot be stopped</i>

328
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:55,624
{\an8}<i>This ensuing struggle</i>

329
00:22:55,832 --> 00:23:00,545
{\an8}<i>Whisk it away beyond
the ends of the earth</i>

330
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,714
{\an8}<i>Along with our breaths</i>

331
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:04,215
{\an8}<i>Take everything</i>

332
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:08,970
{\an8}<i>Whisk it away beyond
the ends of the earth</i>

333
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,013
{\an8}<i>Along with our futures</i>

334
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:12,891
{\an8}<i>Along with our world</i>

335
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:17,228
{\an8}<i>Something no one has ever seen</i>

336
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:23,652
{\an8}<i>The furthest reaches are now
visible to us</i>

337
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:27,656
{\an8}<i>Don't you know God's demand?</i>

338
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:31,159
{\an8}<i>As we tear each other down</i>

339
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:36,665
One of the Special Threats,
Kenpachi Zaraki.

340
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:41,002
Is this the best you can do?

341
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:43,588
How frail.

342
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:49,469
It seems I've overestimated
you people.

343
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,263
Go to sleep.

344
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:57,769
It's been a thousand years,
hasn't it, Yhwach?

345
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:02,983
I've come to put an end
to your life.

346
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,617
<i>"The heart burns."</i>

347
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,620
<i>"Even though the rain falls."</i>
