1
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:23,023
N-No…

2
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:24,774
That's impossible…

3
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,610
I can't believe the Tres Bestia
were defeated…

4
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:31,322
A Soul Reaper with an Arrancar
on his back?

5
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:32,949
How unusual.

6
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:34,576
That being said…

7
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:37,162
I know all about you,

8
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,956
Ichigo Kurosaki.

9
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:45,754
The Daten that His Majesty gave us
included information about you.

10
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,298
You were listed
as a "Special Threat"

11
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:50,341
that we should prioritize
dealing with!

12
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,219
"Special Threat"?

13
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:56,222
<i>That technique…</i>

14
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,349
<i>the Hirenkyaku.</i>

15
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:08,818
Are you guys really Qui--?

16
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:09,903
Oh, my!

17
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:14,949
Don't tell me that you engaged us
<i>without</i> knowing who we were?

18
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:16,659
Very well!

19
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,828
In that case…
I shall answer your question.

20
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:29,756
Yes, we <i>are</i> who you think we are.

21
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:31,841
We are <i>Quincies</i>.

22

{\an8}SQUAD ONE BARRACKS -
CAPTAIN'S MEETING ROOM

23
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:38,473
Quincies…

24
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,642
Well, I figured
that would be the case,

25
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,560
but this is quite the problem.

26
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:45,021
Where is their base of operations?

27
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,983
Unfortunately,
I have yet to find it…

28
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,443
I see…

29
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:53,780
That means we have no way
of attacking them.

30
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:59,911
I'm ordering all Squad Captains
to prepare for war.

31
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,038
The advance guard of the rebel army

32
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:04,415
announced that the battle
would begin in five days,

33
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:07,127
but there is no reason to believe
the words of treacherous fellows

34
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:09,379
that would launch
a surprise attack.

35
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:12,799
We must prepare for battle at once,
as fast as we possibly can!

36
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:16,845
We must not let them
get the upper hand again!

37
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:42,245
{\an8}<i>The blue skies above are hopelessly clear</i>

38
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:47,417
{\an8}<i>At my wit's end, I feel a growing frustration</i>

39
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:52,297
{\an8}<i>As if to laugh at us hopeless cowards</i>

40
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,758
{\an8}<i>Countless eyes stare at us</i>

41
00:02:56,509 --> 00:03:02,348
{\an8}<i>This soul of mine breaks again and again</i>

42
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,560
{\an8}<i>All I can do is hold it tight</i>

43
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:11,858
{\an8}<i>Until the day it turns to ash</i>

44
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,694
{\an8}<i>I've absorbed all of this sorrow</i>

45
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:19,324
{\an8}<i>It has shaped me, painted me</i>

46
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,910
{\an8}<i>But that's how we got here, right?</i>

47
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:26,831
{\an8}<i>One step at a time, just like breathing</i>

48
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,667
{\an8}<i>These countless scars on my palm</i>

49
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:31,669
{\an8}<i>That no longer fade</i>

50
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:35,423
{\an8}<i>Are my badge, my story</i>

51
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:39,344
{\an8}<i>I faced the fear and shred it to pieces</i>

52
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,513
{\an8}<i>And let it walk beside me once more</i>

{\an8}BLEACH: THOUSAND-YEAR BLOOD WAR

54
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,626
All shots hit their mark.

55
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:13,503
What's the matter?!

56
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,588
You can do better than this!

57
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:21,636
That's weird…

58
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,391
I heard that Quincies
only use bows.

59
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,351
What?

60
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:36,359
Kurosaki!

61
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,278
Inoue!

62
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:39,779
Look after Nel!

63
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:48,162
Impressive…

64
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,667
It makes me dismayed
by my lack of skill…

65
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,419
Don't worry.

66
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,130
Your arrows were a lot stronger
than Ishida's.

67
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,008
Though it's been quite some time
since I got hit with one of them.

68
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:01,467
"Ishida"?

69
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,763
By "Ishida,"
are you referring to "Uryu Ishida"?

70
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:09,600
You guys know about Ishida?

71
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:14,355
Uryu Ishida's Heilig Pfeil
is weaker than mine?

72
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:16,941
How odd…

73
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,319
That's not possible.

74
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,279
What do you mean?

75
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:22,739
Whoops.

76
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,616
Speech is silver,
silence is golden.

77
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,910
I've said a little too much.

78
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,579
Forgive me…

79
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,752
Now then, it's time for me
to stop fooling around.

80
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,921
I just received orders
from His Majesty.

81
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:40,673
Just who is this "Majesty"?

82
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:43,801
I have no need
to answer that question.

83
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:47,680
In short, it means
you are going to die here.

84
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,183
Now take a good look.

85
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:54,771
I'm sure you've heard
about this power…

86
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,816
A Quincy's final state, Letz Stile!

87
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:07,450
<i>The Quincy secret move</i>
<i>that Ishida used before!</i>

88
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:20,254
Allow me to explain…

89
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,673
The proper name for this form is…

90
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,302
Quincy Voll Stern Dich.

91
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,641
We've received an update
from Jagd Armee 1.

92
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:34,977
Quilge Opie is currently
engaged in battle

93
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,687
with "Special Threat"
Ichigo Kurosaki.

94
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,899
Then let's go…

95
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:42,068
Where to, Your Majesty?

96
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:44,821
Isn't it obvious?

97
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:47,782
<i>An imperial order from His Majesty</i>
<i>to the Stern Ritter.</i>

98
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:51,285
<i>All Stern Ritter are to</i>
<i>immediately get equipped</i>

99
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,079
<i>and assemble at</i>
<i>the Gate of the Sun.</i>

100
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,580
<i>Repeat…</i>

101
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:55,665
<i>All Stern Ritter are to…</i>

102
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:58,584
The Wandenreich is going to…

103
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,296
invade the Soul Society.

104
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:24,777
Do you feel it?

105
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,947
The pulsation of my power…

106
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:33,119
The power of the one
who shall punish you!

107
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,918
<i>Is that the same technique</i>
<i>that Urahara told me about?</i>

108
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,718
You seem confused.

109
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,803
I know what you're thinking,

110
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,139
so I shall give you
a definitive answer.

111
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,099
It's something entirely different.

112
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:01,647
The Quincy Letz Stile that you know
is a relic of the past

113
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:06,694
that died out 200 years ago
due to its fragile nature.

114
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:10,656
The only one who was attached to it
was Soken Ishida,

115
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:13,534
who rejected our research
and evolution!

116
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:16,704
By comparison,
this Quincy Voll Stern Dich…

117
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,459
the difference in power is
as far apart as heaven and earth!

118
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:23,753
I see…

119
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,547
I don't know about your history,

120
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:29,967
but in short,
it's different from Ishida's power.

121
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:32,261
I'm glad to hear that.

122
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:35,556
If Ishida transformed into
something as creepy as that…

123
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,850
I might cut him down by mistake.

124
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,770
You're easing up on your blade.

125
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:45,858
Getsugatensho!

126
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,114
That's not good.

127
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,620
You should aim your strikes.

128
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:58,955
Damn it!

129
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:04,210
That said, even if you did that,
you wouldn't find any weaknesses!

130
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:09,966
You called this form of mine
creepy, didn't you?

131
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,051
That is the correct response.

132
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:16,305
To the eyes of you
atrocious Soul Reapers,

133
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,559
the form of we holy executioners…

134
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:23,020
should be creepy and horrifying
to behold!

135
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,614
No way!
Sotenkishun is being peeled away!

136
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:38,327
Now have a taste…

137
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:43,249
of my Voll Stern Dich,
the power of Piskiel!

138
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,004
What…?!

139
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,847
What is that monster?

140
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,850
You assumed
we couldn't fight anymore,

141
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,018
so you let down your guard,
didn't you?

142
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,770
I thought we told you that
you shouldn't underestimate us…

143
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:10,067
Show this cocky four-eyed monkey
your power!

144
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:11,569
Ayon!

145
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:18,492
What the hell…

146
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:19,994
is that thing?!

147
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:24,957
Ayon is a monster created through
the fusion of our left arms!

148
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,627
He's got power,
but he's unpredictable!

149
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:35,301
A monster like you could never
beat my Voll Stern Dich--!

00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,608
I thought I told you
not to come in here

155
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:51,692
without my permission.

156
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:56,530
The Soul Society and Hueco Mundo
are being invaded by someone.

157
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,576
And they are most likely…Quincies.

158
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:04,246
There shouldn't be any Quincies
in existence aside from us.

159
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,165
Do you know something about this?!

160
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,086
This has nothing to do with you.

161
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,715
- Get out.
- Are you going to avoid me again?!

162
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,469
I am the last Quincy.

163
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:22,223
I have a right to know
what's going on.

00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:43,744
What is it?

169
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,955
Do you happen to know why
Soul Reapers and Quincies

170
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,915
are at odds with each other
in the first place?

171
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:51,877
We both share the same goal
of defeating Hollows, don't we?

172
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,004
What?!
That's because…

173
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,967
Wait…
Why is that?

174
00:11:58,884 --> 00:11:59,969
You know that in ancient times,

175
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,888
Soul Reapers were referred to
as Balancers, don't you?

178
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,766
Sixth Seat Kajomaru!

179
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:07,810
It's an honor to see you here!

180
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:10,229
Well, the alarms
haven't sounded yet,

181
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:12,398
so why don't we discuss this a bit?

182
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,610
For starters,

183
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,822
you understand the law of
this world where souls circulate

184
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,491
between the World of the Living
and the Soul Society, don't you?

185
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,076
- Yes.
- Of course!

186
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:25,619
Good.

187
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,748
However, souls that become Hollows
in the World of the Living

188
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,542
cannot return to the Soul Society.

189
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:36,839
By purifying Hollows and delivering
their souls to the Soul Society,

190
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:39,633
they are led back to
the normal circulation of souls.

191
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,011
This is the job of Soul Reapers

192
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,763
and the reason why
we are called Balancers.

193
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,225
However, Quincies destroy
and completely extinguish

194
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,769
souls that have become Hollows.

195
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:51,896
What happens when they do that?

196
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:56,275
The souls are unable to return
to the Soul Society?

197
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:57,777
That's right.

198
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,111
Normally,

199
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:01,947
a balance must be maintained
between the number of souls

200
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,617
that exist in the Soul Society
and the World of the Living.

201
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:08,078
As Quincies extinguish more Hollows
in the World of the Living,

202
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:11,540
the number of souls is diminished,
disrupting that natural balance…

203
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,542
If we allow this to happen,

204
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,711
the balance of souls
will eventually be ruined,

205
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,756
causing the Soul Society to flow
into the World of the Living…

206
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:22,885
ending in the simultaneous
destruction of both worlds.

207
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:31,602
There isn't much written
about Quincies to begin with…

208
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,648
Master…

209
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:42,947
"Cannot be found <i>here</i>…"

210
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:47,368
{\an8}ISHIDA RESIDENCE -
RYUKEN ISHIDA'S ROOM

211
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,637
This is Master's--!

212
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,683
To prevent this destruction,

213
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:14,186
the Soul Society had repeatedly
approached the Quincies

214
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,396
for a dialogue,

215
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:17,690
but they were turned away
each time.

216
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,235
The world was steadily
heading toward destruction.

217
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:25,865
And after endless debate
within the Soul Society…

218
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,576
the Quincy Extermination Operation

219
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:31,036
was finally carried out
200 years ago.

220
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,747
Our goals do not mesh

221
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:36,959
and the grudge borne of
their genocide will never perish.

222
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:42,047
The Soul Reapers and Quincies
have no other choice but to fight…

223
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,427
Do you understand,
Squad Member Ryunosuke Yuki?

224
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:50,264
May I…ask one question?

225
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:55,853
Are we Soul Reapers
fighting this battle for justice?

226
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,858
If there is justice
on one side or the other,

227
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,736
it would be called self-defense
or conquest.

228
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,280
However, this is a war.

229
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,490
Wars take place…

230
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,285
because both sides are just.

231
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:16,707
You know why I've called you here,
don't you,

232
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:21,962
{\an8}SQUAD 1 BARRACKS -
HEAD CAPTAIN'S OFFICE

233
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,668
Squad 12 Captain Kurotsuchi?

234
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,463
Is this about mobilizing
members of Squad 12

235
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:26,050
to expunge 28,000 citizens
of the Rukon District

236
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:29,470
without permission in order to
correct the balance of souls?

237
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,181
Why didn't you get permission?

238
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:36,060
Those mass disappearances
in the Rukon District

239
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:40,105
reported by Squad 11's
Third Seat Ikkaku Madarame

240
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,608
and Fifth Seat Yumichika Ayasegawa…

241
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:46,236
You would have gotten permission
if things became dire.

242
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,989
The mass extermination of Hollows
in the World of the Living

243
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:52,159
by the rebel army was intentionally
done to disrupt the balance

244
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:55,162
between the World of the Living
and the Soul Society.

245
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,207
If you consider the fact that
the lives of the people

246
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,584
of the Rukon District stopped
the collapse of both worlds,

247
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,670
it is not that big of a loss.

248
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,046
If I had waited for permission

249
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,382
and the situation had escalated
beyond control,

250
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:09,468
that is not something
I could take responsibility for.

251
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:13,305
But if your Department of
Research and Development

252
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,808
had reported the matter
and promptly dealt with it,

253
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:19,061
we might have prevented
the current situation.

254
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,646
You're wrong about that.

255
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:24,149
The moment that the Quincy
known as Uryu Ishida

256
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,986
infiltrated the Soul Society
as a Ryoka,

257
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:30,489
I had already foreseen this would
happen and had given my advice.

258
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,743
<i>You</i> are the one who chose
to needlessly disregard my words.

259
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:38,497
Everything that is happening now
stems from the fact that

260
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,708
<i>you</i>, Head Captain,

261
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:46,213
couldn't kill that man
1,000 years ago!

262
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,360
Oh, dear.

263
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:11,196
But man, this guy's tough.

264
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,699
I can't believe
he's still in one piece

265
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,743
after that beating
he took from Ayon--

266
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,540
Impressive…

267
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,835
The report did not indicate
this kind of power…

268
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:30,549
I must advise His Majesty
to adjust the strength of our Blut.

269
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,302
But before I do that…

270
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:36,555
Each and every one of you…

271
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:39,183
will die here immediately.

272
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,187
Not again?!

273
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,076
Actually…

274
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,077
Wait, Ayon!

275
00:17:58,368 --> 00:17:59,244
Stop!

276
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:02,706
Perhaps I should say,
"you will <i>live</i> here."

277
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,342
Sklave Rai.

278
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:17,513
A Quincy's basic ability
to focus Reishi.

279
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,264
When taken to its highest limits,

280
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:21,600
it becomes the absolute
subordination of Reishi.

281
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:25,145
If possible,
I didn't want to use it…

282
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:31,110
because my holy wings would be
tarnished by such wicked beings.

283
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,239
A wise decision.

284
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:36,657
However,

285
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,535
you've neglected to take
the difference in our power

286
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:40,953
into consideration.

287
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,005
Inoue!

288
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:56,552
Sado!

289
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:03,976
Whenever I see such a struggle,
it reaffirms my beliefs.

290
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:09,523
Is the sight of the weak dying
always so unsightly?

291
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,525
I cannot stand to watch this.

292
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:13,777
Die.

293
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:24,997
A Bankai…!

294
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,249
If I destroy the disk on your head…

295
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,251
you can't use that absolute
subordination of Reishi anymore,

296
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:30,377
can you?!

297
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,713
Figuring that out is one thing.

298
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:35,340
But to actually go for it
takes courage…!

299
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,217
You really are…

300
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,469
difficult to deal with,
aren't you?!

301
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,682
Hurry!
Hurry it up!

302
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,934
Oh, come on,
what are you talking about?!

303
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,855
You're the one who said,
<i>"We should save Dondochakka"</i>

304
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,025
<i>"while Ichigo Kurosaki is</i>
<i>distracting the enemy!"</i>

305
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,360
That was a close one!

306
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:58,614
I didn't think we would have to
go through this much trouble!

307
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:03,035
Not only are you heavy
but you chose to hide in the sand!

308
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,536
That hurts!

309
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,089
Don't enter without my permission.

310
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:17,549
This is the second time.

311
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:18,842
What's the meaning of this?

312
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,303
Are the things written here true?

313
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,557
I guess that means
you know everything…

314
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,559
About the Wandenreich…

315
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,686
About the guy
referred to as "His Majesty"…

316
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,605
And even about Mom…!

317
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:35,734
Uryu…
This has nothing to do with you.

318
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,830
There's no need to be so tense.

319
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,791
Sixth Seat Kajomaru…

320
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,711
Squad 11 is standing by
outside the gate.

321
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:56,672
There's no need to worry.

322
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,592
- What was that?!
- There's a blue light!

323
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,052
What's going on?!

324
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:07,891
Conflict is such
an unpleasant affair.

325
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,603
{\an8}SQUAD SIX BARRACKS

326
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,603

Reishi Investigation Team!
How much longer?!

339
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:40,632
Spiritual Pressure detected!

340
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,217
A 93 percent match!

341
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:43,844
It's a Quincy!

342
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,230
Lieutenant Kira!

343
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:57,816
How dare you launch
a surprise attack!

344
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,527
Spiral and Rise, Shunjin!

345
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:02,696
Blow, Mogaribue!

346
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:04,948
Counteract, Katakage!

347
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:13,790
Sorry…

348
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:17,085
but our orders are to kill you all.

349
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:27,012
Tremble in fear, Soul Reapers.

350
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:31,475
The Stern Ritters are going to…

351
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,687
purge all of you.

352
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:47,491
{\an8}<i>Everything we had left behind</i>

353
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:51,745
{\an8}<i>Our breaths blending as mist</i>

354
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:56,333
{\an8}<i>without form or expression</i>

355
00:22:56,458 --> 00:23:00,629
{\an8}<i>We lie buried as we glare</i>
<i>into the distance</i>

356
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:03,590
{\an8}<i>I can't hear anything</i>

357
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:06,635
{\an8}<i>I can't seem to cut anything</i>

358
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:09,346
{\an8}<i>It feels like I'm sinking</i>

359
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,306
{\an8}<i>Falling, falling</i>

360
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,391
{\an8}<i>Touching</i>

361
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:15,852
{\an8}<i>Eyes struck wide open</i>

362
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:19,231
{\an8}<i>Something no one has ever seen</i>

363
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:25,529
{\an8}<i>The furthest reaches are now visible to us</i>

364
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:29,491
{\an8}<i>It cannot be undone</i>
<i>and cannot be stopped</i>

365
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:32,828
{\an8}<i>This ensuing struggle</i>

366
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:37,624
{\an8}<i>Whisk it away beyond</i>
<i>the ends of the earth</i>

367
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:39,668
{\an8}<i>Along with our breaths</i>

368
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,420
{\an8}<i>Take everything</i>

369
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:46,174
{\an8}<i>Whisk it away beyond</i>
<i>the ends of the earth</i>

370
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:48,218
{\an8}<i>Along with our futures</i>

371
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,095
{\an8}<i>Along with our world</i>

372
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:54,516
{\an8}<i>Something no one has ever seen</i>

373
00:23:54,599 --> 00:24:00,814
{\an8}<i>The furthest reaches are now</i>
<i>visible to us</i>

374
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,941
{\an8}<i>Don't you know God's demand?</i>

375
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,609
{\an8}<i>Don't you know God's demand?</i>

376
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:08,363
{\an8}<i>As we tear each other down</i>

377
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:17,456
<i>"A frostbitten world turns to fire,</i>
<i>a shadow of a wing remains."</i>

378
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:24,546
<i>"I try and try again,</i>
<i>it slips away, shadow of a wing."</i>
